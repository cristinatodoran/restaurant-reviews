Let me start off by saying that this place is located on the corner of Dexter and Hayes. &#160;This little fact has been a source of great frustration between me and my friends for years. &#160;Anyhow, this is your typical neighborhood bar. &#160;Good food, good drink and good people. &#160;After you've been here a couple of times you are pretty much known by the bartenders and by many of the other patrons... and if you bring your favorite mixed cd you'll most likely get it played at some point in time if you hand it to the person behind the counter.Most of the other reviews for this place are pretty spot on... pool table is temperamental, dart boards are a little worn out and the outdoor patio is a pretty good size. &#160;Not too mention you really wouldn't even make a special trip out here unless you were once or still are a regular. &#160;It's one of those places where you're driving around in the area and you stop in because it seems cool enough for a quick drink till you meet up with other friends at a different place. &#160;But, once you're in there you'll probably want to come back because it is just cool enough to hangout and have a good time. Fantastic after work joint. &#160;Sometimes I get a little tired of it, as going to the same place every week can do, but inevitably every Friday booze calls and I go tromping up the fat hill to have a few (the hill is very fat. &#160;Just FYI in case you want to climb it.) &#160;Lovely little place, nice people (although the guy was a little mean to me once. &#160;That is once, however, and I've been there way more than once) and they have a surprisingly yummy hummus plate.And they haven't kicked us out yet, despite a couple of broken chairs, numerous complaints from their neighbors and a fence scaling incident. &#160;Gotta love the love from neighborhood bars. It's usually not my first choice, but I always have a good time at Dexter &amp; Hayes. &#160;The pool table doesn't necessarily release all the balls every time, and one of the dart boards could use some help (bent wires and old cork can tend to "push" your darts out sometimes)... but for some reason this just lends to the overall "friend's basement" feel. &#160;The staff is extremely attentive and you are never lacking for a drink. this is really a great little "community" pub. it really has that neighborhood sense and feel to it. its probably because most people would not (and i advise you not to) seek it out as a destination type spot. this isnt the kind of place that you would want to go out of your way to visit, its just not worth it for a simple beer. that being said, if you live in the westlake, northeast queen anne part of town this is a great after work spot. the happy hour deals for food (which is just your typical pub fare) and drinks are great and the atmosphere and the barstaff are really very friendly and outgoing. even though the place seems to be packed with "regulars" and people typically know each other from around the block, there is a very welcome attitude to everyone at this place. as far as decor goes, the bar has a very small front end with a couple televisions for sports (they play hockey!) and theres a nice garden patio out back and a small little rec room with a pool table and dart board down below. seriously, if youre in the neighborhood stop by during the late afternoons, its a very welcoming mix of both young and old. also, it gets pretty happening at night, especially on mondays when their resident piano man plays a set starting at 9pm. I came here for a friends birthday party. &#160;They reserved they entire basement for a 200 dollar deposit. &#160;So you can have the whole basement to yourself and if you don't burn the place down you get it for free. &#160;This is awsome. &#160;Anyway the drinks are good and I spent way too much so it must be a good bar.
Nice place. &#160;Smallish, low key, comfortable decor, but also nice enough to dress up for if you like. &#160;Not that we did... &#160;If there's a wait, you can spend the time next door at the attached bar. &#160;Interesting cocktails and fancy bar food while you wait.Once back in the restaurant, the menu of small, shareable plates covers a lot of ground. &#160;Everything we tried was good, from the (not just good -- excellent) steak tartar to the rotisserie pork belly. &#160;Service was not 100%, but was friendly and unobtrusive, and any errors were corrected in the right way.Two negative points, though: &#160;One, what's the deal with Seattle cheese plates? &#160;Every place I've had one, we're talking tiny little smidgens of cheese. &#160;The markup must be astounding. &#160;To Lark's credit, at least the cheeses were of nice style and quality, and not overripe (Hi again, Palace Kitchen).Two, the wine list was not impressive and doesn't match the value of the food (which is mostly reasonably priced). &#160;We had two bottles of wine, both in the $30-40 range, and they were both disappointing to me (although they did put me in remarkably fine spirits!). &#160;Granted, this is the "low end" for wine at many places, but it should be easy for Lark to find a few bottles in this range that would better match the quality of the food. &#160;Given the $15 corkage fee, just about any $15 bottle of wine you'd care to bring will put you well ahead of the game. The best of Seattle's bird species named restaurants. Oh my god this place is great. Some many good things to try with the menu changing with seasonal items. I cannot wait to go back. After only two visits, Lark has become my favorite restaurant in Seattle for a nice night out, and without a doubt has the best food I've had since moving here.As an East Coast emigre, I admit to my confusion regarding "nice" restaurants in Seattle. I show up in my business-casual work clothes, and nobody's dressed better than I am: no jackets, no ties. People in t-shirts and polo shirts. I don't think it's wrong, but it makes me a little uneasy.Lark made it easier: the cozy rustic decor and extremely friendly staff brought about a very California sort of enforced casualness.I definitely found the menu complex to navigate the first time I arrived, but our waitress happily answered all of our questions without any disdain or frustration.And, oh yeah, the food? It's stellar. Small plates, meant to be shared, but don't get the cheese platter unless there are at least three or four of you; it gets in the way of trying other dishes.Start, perhaps, with the blood orange and endive salad. It's a visually stunning piece of work, with the deep red of the oranges on the outside of an endive pyramid. It's beautiful, and the sweetness of the oranges nicely balances the bitterness of the endive. The awesome presentation and complex flavors set the tone for the rest of Lark's food.Don't miss the rosti potatoes: a crispy, tasty potato pancake, like if your Jewish grandmother made latkes after studying nouvelle cuisine in Paris, or your morning short-order cook decided to make his hash browns a work of art.The fish and meat plates are spectacular: the pork rillettes are rich flavorful, the sea scallops are well-prepared, and the elk is great. The braised beef shortribs balance homey pot roast flavors with restaurant flair, managing to be both comforting and extravagant at the same time.Do save room for dessert: the frozen Meyer lemon parfait stands out as the choice to make. The other desserts fade from memory, but this sharp and fragrant concoction is unshakeable. Get at least one for your table, no matter how many other desserts you decide upon.All told, expect to order five or six small plates for two people, not including dessert. Add in a glass or two of wine each, and you're talking sixty-five to seventy-five dollars per person, after tax and tip.One last word: the menu is definitely carnivore-centric; dedicated vegetarians may be disappointed. Those tasty rosti potatoes are fried in duck fat. Some friends treated my wife and me to dinner at Lark and what a treat it was. &#160;It was the first time all four of us had been there, so the waitress explained the portion sizes &amp; family style presentation. &#160;The warm, comfortable atmosphere is inviting, with exposed wooden rafters, and curtains hanging from a track that snakes around the room, allowing for the room to be open or to be sectioned off into private dining areas.We each ordered two items that looked good, and then they determined in what order to best serve our dishes, beginning with a selection of cheeses (we asked them to pick 3 that would match what we had ordered). &#160;Sharing the choices of three other people, I expected there would be at least one dish I wouldn't be thrilled about, but everything was excellent! &#160;The striped bass was buttery and had a nice firm texture, and I am not a big fan of fish. Fuji apple, raddichio and balsamic salad was sweet/savory delicious. &#160;And the sausage &amp; pork belly over white corn melted in my mouth. &#160;They surprised us with a couple free desserts ("mistakes" from another table)... chocolate cake with coffee ice cream (again, not a fan of coffee, but this was so good I might have to reconsider) and apple tart with vanilla ice cream.Definitely treat yourself to an evening at Lark if you have the chance. Lark was by far my favorite meal in Seattle. &#160;I love the intimate and sophisticated dining room, and the food was all absolutely delicious. i started with the &#160;pork rillettes with fleur de sel butter and radishes, then the Corn Soup with poached duck egg and summer truffles, and finally squab with figs and a port sauce. &#160;for dessert, i had a rhubarb cobbler. &#160;My only dissapointment: i wish i could have tried much much more! next time i will have to bring someone with me. very good flavors, interesting and reliably tasty combonations of things like: Duck eggs, &#160;wild mushrooms, olives, radicchio, prosciutto and manilla clams. Just ask your server for clarification of things foreign and otherwise unusual: (the following words straight from the menu) MOZZARELLA BURRATA, VENTRECHE, CLABBER CREAM, FARRO, SULTANA, LANDJAGAR, CARPACCIO, SABA, CORNICHONS, SWEEDBREADS, GNUDI, BLANQUETTE, and EMMER. Lark serves foods from local "sustainable" artisan farms, bakeries, &#160;and butchers. &#160;Everything is served in it's own, specially designated plate or vessel, often bare cast-iron (STAUB brand) dutch ovens. &#160;The dessert is mighty fine and very welcome after a salty meal. Try the Lemon parfait.European to the core, (from the menu to the "W.C." on the bathroom door to the big bill at the end) lark pleases your small group or a hot date. Bring the airline miles visa card.
Everything I could want in a neighborhood pizza place. Solid east-coast-style pizzas, cold beer, and full tilt ice cream! Plus, video games, a kids play area (If you are a childophobe, you probably should get takeout, it's VERY kid-friendly inside)The Aloha pizza is your standard Hawaiian plus sun-dried tomatoes. It sounds a little weird, but they aren't super dried, and add a nice dimension.The Pritty Boys' Special is something out of my childhood. Pepperoni, Sausage, Mushrooms, and Black Olives. Yum!Great sauce, great flavor to the crust, though the oven could be a little hotter and crisp up the edges a bit more.I didn't have any problem with the service like other reviewers mentioned. Sure it was a little slow, as they were very busy, but everyone was super-nice and friendly. I really like the pizza but the service needs improvement. The food: The pizza has great sauce and the crust has a great combination of crunch and chew. Very nice. We have had a couple different salads and they have been quite good. Definitely much better than your typical pizza place fare.The service: Have been three times and I don't think I have seen a smile on the staff yet. I know the place is new so I give them a little slack, but it has definitely been disappointing. I also know they get busy but smiles and friendly attitudes can't take that much time can they? &#160;A good service contrast in the neighborhood would be St. Clouds, been there many times and have always felt greeted warmly and served happily. It makes a big difference.So I will return but it might end up being more take out than eat in unless the service improves, which I am hopeful it will. I would love for this place to be a regular spot for us. Take out pizza tonight from our first neighborhood pizzeria and we're fans! Crispy crust and a bit of chew...I can honestly say as a New Jerseyite, this is as close to east coast pizza as I've discovered in Seattle. &#160;We are so excited. &#160;Mama's Pizza on Capital Hill is a close second for us. &#160;The woman who took the order and provided the service was a bit flat, hoping she gets a bit more excited about the great pizza they are serving. &#160;Seems like a super family friendly space. &#160;The website is not yet up and running, but will likely up soon. Have some Molly Moons afterwards at the new MM spot a 1/2 block up. &#160;Check it out! The pizza is pretty good, and there's a kid's play area, and those are the only two positives in this place. &#160;The service is terrible however, as it seems like the waiter had never waited on anyone before - he took our drink and food order, came back with our drinks and then never showed up again. &#160;We had to scour the place to find him to ask him for the bill. Ok they have some kinks to iron out, but they have some key things going for them that already makes them a way more pleasant place than the alehouse down the street (a place that should be awesome but isn't). The pizza is good, but the most pleasant surprise is that the salads are excellent. The price point is good for the pizza and the salads. The pasta is good but seems a little overpriced. The servers are very sweet and are clearly trying to do a good job which makes the place have a nice vibe even if they aren't always on top of it. They really doubled down on the kids area both in the main room for little kids and in the back where there is an xbox, wii and pinball machine. Its pretty cool but the downside is that it makes the layout of the tables kind of wonky. Maybe they should have consulted a feng shui expert or something, the bar doesnt quite feel like a bar yet with the icecream case on one side and boxes of bottled beer on the other. These things are all pretty minor and definitely fixable over time. If they keep working at it I can see this fitting into Madrona very nicely.
Mediocre food and decent service. Why don't they get a better restaurant in place of this place? I title this "Holy s&amp;*, seriously, how dare you not comp the ENTIRE bill". Dedicated to Ella C. &#160;Several years ago, in 2005 BY (BEFORE YELP), my sis&amp; I drowned our post-visting our father / pre-morning coffee sorrows in a delicious mound of heavenly french toast stuffed I MEAN STUFFED french toast, oozing I MEAN OOZING w/ blueberry &amp; ricotta cheese stuffing. &#160;In fact, before my last visit to Julia's I had their stuffed french toast listed as my YELP WHAT IS YOUR LAST MEAL meal. &#160;Well, I changed that listing toot sweet after last weekend's fateful experience ...Picture it. &#160;Sunday morning. &#160;A highly anticipated re-creation of the Sunday morning years ago where sis &amp; I shared heavenly pillows of frenchy toasty goodness. &#160;We even found a parking spot RIGHT in front! &#160;Good start, right?? &#160;Oh how wrong wrong wrong we were. &#160;There were 4 of us, so we decided to order the stuffed french toast as an appetizer if you will, for us to share. &#160;Mind you, my sis &amp;I have not only talked this french toast up to our breakfast companions Ella C. &amp; Mom of Winston, but we have elevated its reputation to that of a cancer curer, a million dollar lottery winning, no traffic on the 405 EITHER DIRECTION at 5 o'clock (that's like the LA version of the Bay Bridge, for you 415 or 510-er's, or the Floating Bridge if you live in the 206). &#160;We ask for the pre-requisite cups o' coffee (here I digress, how SHITTY is drip coffee in Seattle restaurants when most establishments make a latte that brings me to a euphoric state of nirvana - hey, Nirvana, Seattle, get it?!?!), &amp;place our accompanying egg-based orders. &#160;Here's where our story takes a gastronomical turn for the worse. &#160;My sister &amp; Ella C ask for soy sausage in their breakfast burritos. &#160;I ask for the regular breakfast burritio, Winston's mom asks for a delightful sounding yogurt granola parfait &amp; a side of bacon. &#160;The waiter asks her how many slices-2, or 4. &#160;Pay attention to her answer, it will reveal it's relevance later. &#160;She answers 4-4 slices of bacon. &#160;We order our french toast appetizer &amp; our 'waiter' scurries off. &#160;In what seems like HOURS later, our "waiter" (god, I just lol'd typing the word 'waiter' to refer to the EFFING JACKASS who somehow hijacked a real waiters uniform &amp; played a cruel joke on us by imitating someone whose job it is to listen to us ask for food, then write down what we say, then walk it to a kitchen prep area) delivered plates of food to our table, not necessarily our food, but to be fair plates had food on them. &#160;Exhibit A: &#160;He delivered plate of the cinammon french toast, not the stuffed french toast as ordered. &#160;Exhibit B: &#160;After placing orders in front of us, he busted out his best waiter karaoke (thank you Bill Simmons) "did you need anything else right now"? &#160;Um, our stuffed french toast &amp; the side of bacon. &#160;"How many slices?" he asked, "Um, 4, like I said". &#160;He blinked &amp; walked away. &#160;Minga B took a bite of her burrito first (even though she &amp; Ella B ordered same thing, Ella C is STRICT vegetarian &amp; Minga B is SO NOT so Minga B is always the test-biter-into-er. &#160;Minga B took a forkful of burrito &amp; put it in her mouth. &#160;Her face twisted into some sort of expression reserved for the ugliest of scary gargoyles - give me back my sister!!! - &amp; said "oh my god, these eggs taste REALLY funny"... She took another bite to see if she could figure out why. &#160;We all stopped to look at her as her confusion turned to visible revulsion at the answer provided by her taste buds: &#160;"Oh my god you guys, these eggs have f&amp;*%ing SOY SAUCE on them!!!". &#160;THE LITERAL DUMB WAITER HEARD SOY SAUCE NOT SOY SAUSAGE!! &#160;As my jaw drops in disbelief, I manage to close it around my forkful of my regular breakfast burrito. &#160;WTF?!? &#160;What's the funny taste I am now experiencing?? &#160;Well, it's PINEAPPLE!!! &#160;FUNNY, I DON'T REMEMBER BREAKFAST BURRITOS COMING WITH PINEAPPLE EVER IN MY LIFE OF EATING EGGS WRAPPED IN TORTILLAS WHICH IS A LOT CONSIDERING I'M HALF MEXICAN! &#160;As if soy sauce eggs weren't enough, there was pineapple in my burrito. &#160;Winston's mom still hadn't received her 4 f&amp;*%ing slices of hog back. &#160;When the waiter finally returns to deliver the stuffed french toast &amp; my friend's bacon, my sister looks at him, trying to be kind she says "um, I think you heard SOY SAUCE instead of SOY SAUSAUGE", he says "um, yeah, I thought that sounded strange". &#160;"Why didn't you ask us then?" she said. &#160;Blink. &#160;He returned to kitchen to have poor chef re-make burritos leaving us w/ the most ANEMIC stuffed french toast i've ever seen. &#160;Even the toast was embarrassed to call itself French wearing it's flimsy bluberry outfit. &#160;We all stared at it &amp; I could feel my friends thinking "those broads crapped themselves over this sh&amp;^?" &#160;We quietly picked at the plate waiting for replacement burritos to arrive. &#160;Once they did, sis &amp; Ella b didn't even care. We debated over tip or no tip, the waiter didn't believe my pineapple claim, &amp; I learned a valuable lesson: HEED THE YELPS FOR THEY DO NOT LIE! the service is pretty bad. the two times we went there, it took forever to get our orders and our food...and they always messed up atleast two things.and once, i was there with my boyfriend and the waiter came up to us and was all "how can i help you ladies today?" and my boyfriend turned around and was like "uhh..." and the waiter got all awkward.but that was just funny. This place is notorious for terrible service(if you get any at all) I tried this place a couple of times and every time I was flabbergasted at the lack of attention to the clientele. Even more I was amazed at the lack of a PERSON there to not be paying attention to us. The firs time I went there we stood in the doorway for over 10 minutes before anyone even came to seat us. 15 minutes later we were seated at a table that pretty much had a big velvet curtain resting ON it, I felt like we kids again hiding in the curtains. Someone asked us about drinks, we ordered and then waited...and waited....and waited. The person who took our drink order wasn't even the server. We never saw them again and consequently (seriously) never got a server to our table. Naturally we got up and left hungry and frustrated and fairly amazed that it was THAT bad. The second time we decided to see if they had figured it out yet, we again stood in the doorway and waited to be seated...and waited...and waited...and waited. No one EVER came to seat us! I thought 'oh my lord'. &#160;That was it for me, since then I have consistently heard of their terrible service when service is even available. So this place is on my official blacklist. I'm a huge fan of their seafood salad. &#160;I was a little sad though that they quit putting fried calamari on it, but it still tastes yummy. &#160;I think other food items are fine, nothing so spectacular to me.Service can vary depending on the server. &#160;And do not expect to get a wonderful service on Sunday morning-afternoon. &#160;There's gonna be a long wait no matter how much you bitch about it. &#160;My favorite breakfast is the Chicken fried chicken (fried steak) ... hmmm tasty.Also, their drag show is a must-see. &#160;It was way more exciting and well &#160;constructed than I had expected. &#160;$10 per ticket, but get their early to get a good seat! A great place to break in my new Prime card with an old friend. Service was fine, and we didn't mind any small waits. I had the chicken gyro which was very good, my friend had a salad which, frankly, I didn't even look at we were so busy catching up. Lunch for two after Prime card + tip (on amount of original bill, of course) = $18. Gotta love it! Not a place I'd ever go back to. &#160;Reasons:Waited at least ten minutes for a table. &#160;The one person on duty at that point seemed overwhelmed by her three tables (not counting us) and just plain annoyed to see us.When we were finally instructed to take whatever table we wanted (the place was dead... &#160;why couldn't she have said that 10 minutes earlier?), we didn't get water or menus ... or coffee for another ridiculously long time. &#160;I was nearly driven to nibbling the dried out pepperoncini stem I found on our table (um, ick)!!! &#160;Not really... &#160;I was feeling more inclined to leave, but we foolishly kept hoping we'd catch the attention of a server... &#160;finally... it happened!! &#160;A different server who was nice but couldn't seem to remember our orders.My brother ordered the french toast. &#160;The bread was thick... &#160;and wasn't given the opportunity to soak up any custardy goodness... &#160;so his breakfast was disappointingly dry. &#160;Booo!!I had the basil and cream cheese scramble. &#160;Not bad actually.Since I am forced to give at least one star... &#160;We'll just say it's for the third server who handed us our bill. &#160;She brought it to us immediately after we requested it, and made my brother laugh by calling him gumdrop. &#160;:-) If you have yet to experience the displeasure of biting into eggz scrambled with soy sauce, I sincerely hope you are forever spared the sensation. &#160;(Please refer to Ramona R's brilliant review). I had read the reviews about the service here, but I couldn't believe that it could happen to me. I am pretty positive that the servers are told specifically to seem to not care about the guests, as our waitress was almost comically horrible at her job and condescending. It was like we went to a theme restaurant where the theme was forgetting what you ordered and being weirdly bitchy to everyone. The restaurant wasn't very packed but it took a while to get service. As far as the menu goes, they have the same pub fare every single damn restaurant in Seattle has. A list of the same burgers (holy crap, you have a mushroom burger?! I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT), "American" stuff and salad. I guess if you subsist entirely on Mac N Jacks and bacon burgers this place would be awesome for you. I decided to shake things up and get their meatloaf, which was not entirely horrid. It had been sitting under the heat lamp for a bit too long so that the outside of the mashed potatoes had a crust on them, which lent more credence to my theory of them being bad on purpose. The loaf itself was waaaaaay too garlicky and it was served with mixed vegetables. Honestly. Why do restaurants STILL serve mixed vegetables? I can't think of one person who thinks that they are a totally awesome thing to eat. Oh, can I please have more plain steamed carrots and broccoli?! THAT WAS SO BLANDLY DELICIOUS YAY.I went there for dinner, but I hear that their brunch and breakfasts are better. For a place so popular, it really surprised me how lackluster it was. Meh. Julias is a great breakfast option on Broadway. There's a pretty big vegetarian menu and you can substitute tofu for eggs in a number of 'rancheros' type breakfasts for a fee. I usually get the "tofu breakfast" which I enjoy, whereas a lot of tofu stirfry/scramble plates are mediocre I like this one.The interior is uniquely decorticated, another opportunity to stare at something new. I don't know about the shows they have here, but the stage looks cool with the old heavy theater curtains. I've been here a few times with friends congregating from all over and the servers have been attentive enough to notice that we had new people throughout the meal and kept coming back with water and coffee refills through the meal. &#160;I can see it being a little lax at times, but it's a laid back breakfast show up my book, and whenever I go here I'm in no hurry. I've been going here off and on for years. This is my favorite breakfast spot, and occasionally just a good place to drop in and have a bloody mary. Maybe I'm just a creature of habit, but the atmosphere here is fun and the staff is completely adorable. I love it. P.S. Stop groaning about having to wait during the the morning or lunchtime rush. I mean seriously, welcome to eating on Cap Hill. If you want fast food, go to Jack in the Box.
Oh. My. Gosh. What an amazing sandwich. Top-notch ingredients really go a long way at Westlake Specialty, Boar's Head meats and cheese make these sandwiches, surely. I just discovered this little gem the other day on my lunch break, just a few blocks away! Hooray! Granted, I can't always drop that kind of cash on a sandwich, my Reuben was around $8, and worth every penny. It's actually best Reuben I've ever had, not that I'm any expert on the subject. The coleslaw was crisp, fresh, and provided the perfect crunch, graciously piled on a heaping serving of warm Boar's Head pastrami. Is your mouth watering yet?I thought that I was going to be receiving a pre-fab sandwich like the ones sitting in the display case, all of which looked equally amazing, but upon my order, I was pleased to wait just a few minutes to have my Reuben freshly-made and grilled on the panini press. What a FABULOUS sandwich!!!Not only does Westlake Specialty have a great variety of sandwiches (and, of course, if you don't find exactly what you're looking for, you can custom order your own), but a wide variety of groceries, fine wine, cheeses, all sorts of snacks and sodas. This is pretty much the ideal convenience store for those ready to spend a little extra cash.Try Westlake Specialty! You won't be disappointed!!!Thanks for listening! Great sandwich with Boar's Head meats and cheese. &#160; Clean market. &#160;Small countertop seating. &#160;Perfect for a quick, healthy lunch.
Decent food but a dirty establishment. &#160;This place is always crowded during the lunch hour. &#160;Imagine eating inside of a packed King County Metro bus and you have an idea of what a busy lunch is like here.If you are a hardcore germaphobe you probably wouldn't like this place.I made the mistake of sitting outside one day when it was nice and was harassed by every homeless person that walked by and asked for everything from my drink to a handful of french fries to $20. Got my 3 Q's! Quick, Quality, and Quantity! Delicious! Any choice on their large menu is a good choice! Just make sure you bring a bib because it can get messy!Must Try: Beef Gyro and the Balaclava &#160;DELICIOUS and total less than $10! Open late! PS great Cream Cheese Hot Dogs on those cold, drunken nights (stands out at 7:30p!) This place looked good from the outside, but I was pretty disappointed with the food. &#160;The gyro meat came in big, dry chunks - not very tasty. &#160;Their spanakopita filled with almost all onion with only a little bit of spinach - I couldn't eat more than two bites. The best falafel ever, and cheap! I love this place, working downtown it's hard to find a decent, affordable eating establishment since everwhere you looks it's nothing but upscale, snooty booty cafes and wine bars. Nothing beats going here before or after a M's game if you starved yourself enough and avoided the $10 garlic fries. Seen a few concerts at qwest field event center and descended on this place in the later hours. Sitting outside on a warm summer morning around 1 am with tzatziki sauce dripping on your shirt, nothing comes close. I love the wall of sport's memobilia they have, although seeing Gary Payton wearing a Sonics jersey always gets me teared up, R.I.P. supes. Cream cheese kosher hot dogs! Can't get any better. The guy who usually makes them is hilarious and will keep you entertained while you wait for your late night fix. Its great because they are usually there until 1 or 2 in the morning if not later. Havent really tried anything else on the menu because I am hooked on the hot dogs. Always one of my favorite places to go for a quick bite to eat. Will I go back?.....YES. Should you go?.....Only if you are not going to get in the way of me chomping on my meal!
Wow...I can't believe I've lived in Seattle 16 &#160;years and just found out about this place. The Bahn Mi pork sandwich came highly recommended and did not disappoint. The fact that it costs only $2.50 is a huge bonus. We will add this to our regular rotation!Oh...they have parking next to the deli as well, which is super convenient. I've had a bahn mi (pork) at just about every vietnamese deli in the ID because I love them THAT much and I want to make sure I'm getting the best one. &#160;Saigon Deli is definitely the best for sandwiches. &#160;I will come all the way from Wallingford, ON THE BUS, for this sandwich, this is how much I love it. &#160;I usually get the spring rolls with the spicy peanut sauce too. &#160;I've always wanted to try other stuff, but I can never bring myself to order anything else because I love the sandwich so so much. &#160;We usually eat in the car because there is no seating, but the curb outside is nice too! As everybody else has said, Saigon is the shizzy! &#160;The bahn mi are to die for. &#160;I love the roast and shredded pork. &#160;Perfect balance of flavor, crusty bread and spice make this one of my favorite sandwiches in the world. &#160;They can get very hectic around the lunch hour, so come early if you can, I promise you wont be disappointed. Saigon Deli is a great place if you're looking for cheap eats including banh mi or Vietnamese style sandwiches and snacks such as che or Vietnamese sweet desserts. &#160;The banh mi is VERY cheap, at around $2/each, and it only takes 1 or 2 to really fill you up. &#160;Aesthetically, Saigon Deli is a hole in the wall but it serves its purpose nonetheless. &#160; &#160;Saigon Deli doesn't have a place to seat either inside or outside so you'll have bring your lunch elsewhere in the ID. I am all about eating good healthy, clean food. &#160;I've been coming here for a long time and have been loving their sandwiches and gave high reviews to my friends about it..until recently...One time I walked in to order sandwiches and everything was great...but if you notice...the ladies that make your sandwiches...they wear rubber gloves when they make it..but they also use the same gloves when they take your money and give you change....and sometimes they use that same glove to make another person's sandwich....gross...Happened twice in a row.....that's just nasty. &#160;Besides that...I love their food...but next time Im going to ask them to reuse the gloves...so I give it a 3 star. Quick, easy, cheap, &amp; flavorful grilled meat (had the pork sandwich). Actually I lied, I had two.In and out, bam! bam!... Total cost = $5.00.Seattle, if I ever see you again, come find me in Saigon Deli I heart Saigon Deli. Best banh mi in Seattle, hands down. And so ridiculously cheap. We always get the pork and house special, and can't figure out which one we love more. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. As good as cheap ($2.50) sandwiches can get. &#160;Sure you can get a better sandwich, but you would pay 4 or 5 times more. &#160;This place is fantastic, they have a much better ordering system than other Vietnamese sandwich shops, the help may not speak a lot of English but they do know how to make a fantastic sandwich.Co-workers have raved about how good the other food is, but every time I go I have to order a sandwich. &#160;Going at lunch time the store will be quite full of people waiting, typically though the wait for a sandwich is less than 5 minutes. &#160;How they make the food so cheap, is beyond me, or I just don't want ot know. AWESOME sandwichesAWESOME spring rollsCRAPPY that they close at 7 AND they run out of spleeng lolls. I was surprised that they close at 6 now...the economy must really suck. Good thing I was able to get there 15 minutes before closing to get some tasty sandwiches. You must get the grilled pork sandwich....or maybe two. It's so freakin good. I'm always dumbfounded that sandwiches this cheap could taste so good...every bite was just full of flavor. You can buy like 4-5 sandwiches for about $10 max. Next time I'm in Chinatown this will be my official place to stop by for some tasty banh mi. Be sure to get there before they close! I remember my parents coming here to get banh mi when I was a kid and I recently rediscovered this place as an adult. &#160;Probably Seattle's best banh mi period. &#160;I'll easily get 5-10 sandwiches at a time and have lunch for a whole week! &#160;Just heat em' up in a toaster oven. &#160;MMMMM!!! &#160;I think I'll go there again right now! &#160;There's no place to sit so come here and grab some for a picnic or take it back to your place so you can eat it in the privacy of your own home, in your underwear! &#160;Hahahahaha! In search of portable chow for the M's game? There is no cheaper/ tastier game fare than a couple bahn mi from Saigon DeliOrder up a couple of these bad boys and toss 'em in your bag/ back pack and head into Safeco. I'm telling you- your neighbors in the surrounding seats will be envious and wish they were as smart as you.I prefer the beef, but the tofu is just as tasty. And if you're really feeling indulgent, snag some of their fresh rolls for a little over a dollar for two. Yes, you really can get 3 or 4 delicious sandwiches and a couple of spring rolls here for under $10...the same price you'll pay for a stale brick o' fries. Like I said, Saigon Deli is where it's at. Your wallet and your waistline will thank you. Saigon Deli in the I-District on South Jackson. Yes, I needed to be that descript with which establishment I am reviewing. There is a Saigon Deli in the Uwajimaya food court and in the U-District and Saigon Vietnam Deli a block away. When I first was looking for this Saigon Deli, I had mistaken Saigon Vietnam for it which makes me appreciate the Yelp picture feature very much. It helps me figure if I am at the right restaurant or not.Having figured out and found the right location for Saigon a while back, I now go to Saigon as my main banh mi supplier. Prices are pretty much in line with neighboring shops in that they are cheap. Particularly like their three ham sandwich (#2) and the shrimp spring rolls with peanut sauce. The service sometimes leaves a little to be desired, but overall Saigon Deli in the I-District on South Jackson is a good cheap and fast place to go and get something tasty to eat. I think Subway has met its new competitor for cheap, healthy sandwiches. Saigon Deli incorporates fresh ingredients and charges no more than $2.50 for even the meatiest option.I had the roasted pork sandwich (#1) and the mixed ham and pork sandwich (#3). The O.G. roasted pork is definitely better. Perfect flaky bread, slices of roasted pork, and crunchy marinated carrots, cucumbers, etc. Their spring rolls can rival any restaurant and are huge for only 2 bucks!I wonder if Saigon Deli has ever thought about franchising... I wasn't sure @ first I got the right &#160;Saigon Deli; I suck @ directions &amp; there is apparently a ton of Saigon Deli's in a 2 block radius?!?. &#160;Anyway, I got 2 gigantic sandwiches...figure I'll save one for later. &#160;As far as price...can't beat a huge grilled pork sandwich for $2.50 or $2.75...whatever, it's cheap. &#160;The bread was crusty &amp; delicious, ingredients tasted fresh and the sandwiches have a little kick in them (they add jalepenos). &#160;The chicken sandwich was less tasty but still okay. &#160;I give this place 3 stars b/c being cheap isn't exactly a rare thing when it comes to bahn mi sandwiches. &#160;The sandwiches are solid, but I've had better. &#160;And I get that Asian places aren't the cleanest and personally I wasn't that bothered by the fact that I saw pre-packaged spring rolls neatly stacked on the table near the counter...I wouldn't buy anything that wasn't refrigerated and had shrimp in it, but that's not my problem. &#160;But mostly can't give it 4 stars b/c I'm a pig and hate having to get back in my car to then drive somewhere else to get pho. &#160;All in all, one of many places you can grab a good lunch. I love this place. I get spring rolls, bahn mi, and various jelly desserts or small cakes- for cheap cheap cheap! The flavours are quite tasty and the price is a hit. It is a mandated stop for me while I am near or on Jackson. Let me start off by saying I have never stepped foot into Saigon Deli so I can not comment on the atmoshpere, the service, etc. I do, however, take an occasional art class at Pratt Fine Art center down the street and Saigon Deli is the #1 food pitstop for myriad starving artists.As result, I have snarfed down their pork bahn mi-s on numerous occasions. There's always someone in my class who makes a Saigon Deli run for sandwiches and spring rolls and just about everyone puts in an order.What amazes me, after 5+ years of attending Pratt, is in that time period the price has remained low and the quality has remained consistent. I mean, how do they do it? At about two smackeroos per sandwich, the price/quality/ taste ratio is out of this world! Unbelievably so. I feel like I'm getting away with something.What you get is about a 9 inch long piece of French bread that's not too soft, but not too crusty either. Your lap isn't showered with crust dust when you take a bite. Inside is some mayo that I believe is slightly flavored with lime or lemon, a little bit of a pate spread of some sort, a hearty layer of tender and mouthwatering pork and then layers of carrots, cool crunchy cucumbers, white onions, cilantro, and jalapeno peppers. With each bite there's insane layers of flavor. Seriously, it's like flavor fireworks going off in your mouth. It so fresh and full of mouthwatering flavor that I &#160;can not express how delicious it is. This sandwich is to die for. I've tried other bahn mi sandwiches at other places but hands down this IS the best place in Seattle to get bahn mi. My only beef is I don't live close enough to Saigon Deli to go on my own. Otherwise, I easlily would be there at least two to three times a week if not more.If you're ever in this side of town and are looking for cheap, quick, good eats I highly suggest stopping by. I haven't tried any of their other menu items so I can't speak for those but if they're anything like the pork bahn mi then you won't be disappointed. Wonderful, flavorful, inexpensive food here. I picked up 2 Bahn mi BBQ'd pork sandwiches, bitter melon soup, rice and pork dinner, 2 French coffees and a hombao for $13! How great is that. The sandwich bread is fresh and crunchy and if you pay cash, you get a better price. I love it! Thanks Seattle Yelpers, for leading this visitor to the Bahn Mi at Saigon Deli. After a hard truck up Jackson against a cold March wind, I was ravenously hungry. &#160;Oops...I discovered that it really IS just a deli, there are no tables or chairs. After ordering my barbecue pork Bahn Mi, I asked the owner if there were any nearby parks, since I wanted to sit down and eat. &#160;He insisted that I stay and sit on a plastic drum behind the counter. &#160;This afforded me a fascinating view of the kitchen, which had two huge covered cooking pots sitting on an flaming brazier. The sandwich was a chewy, fresh, mouthwatering blend of savory (pork), hot (jalepeno) and cool (mayonnaise, cucumber and cilantro). Wish I could have a dozen shipped to Chicago right now. Killer Banh Mi Thit! &#160;This is the only place in the city I buy em. &#160; &#160;I like the shu mai personally and the classic thit nuong. &#160;Lines are getting long but they are really fast at making them. &#160;Good strong Cafe Sua Da (Vietnamese coffee w/ condensed milk) and also Che (desserts). &#160;Great for people on a budget and wanting a really good filling sandwich. &#160;Nice job guys and can u somehow add some tables please! :) &#160;hahah...
So many tvs!! This is a great place to come and watch a game. I almost want to say they have more flatscreen tvs than tables here. We actually came for a night of karaoke and I have to say we had a really great time. The host did a fantastic job and the sound was very clear and the songbooks were huge. I would absolutely come back here for karaoke. Service was attentive as well. The owners seem nice and kept a beer in our hands. The apps we tried were so so. I really liked the greek platter. The buffalo wing sauce was good but the wings were pretty dry and chewy. The nachos desperately needed cheese. After a few bites we were left with a pile of plain chips to pick at. You have to put cheese on your nachos. My friends were very happy with the sandwiches and burgers they ordered. I am excited to try more of the food, they have a nice variety on the menu. &#160;Like I said, we will definitely be back for karaoke. I hope this place does well, I really liked the atmosphere here.EDIT: I turned around and went right back here. We tried the burger, the clam chowder and the Spartan flatbread. It was all really good and I love the fries. Super crispy and delicious. The service was still great. I believe this is going to be a new hang out spot for our group. I'm bumping it up to four stars. used to go here every wednesday for about a year and a half. &#160;was SUPER bummed when they shut down, but understood the obvious reason. &#160; went to the grand opening and it's great! biggest bummer, however, is the gaping lack of a pool table. &#160;they used to have one, now they have big buck hunter and darts or something.... not a worthy replacement. &#160;oh well. decent kitchen, attentive wait staff, LOTS of BIG tv's, decent deals. $5 mimosas and $5 bloody marys. Need I say more? This place is definitely a hidden gem in a City lacking good sports-bars. The service is solid (friendly, professional, attentive and attractive). The food is plentiful and absolutely delicious. Prices reasonable. What makes this place so great are the number of wide screen HD's strategically placed everywhere. They have all games going and quick to accommodate any particular game requests with smiling faces. If you don't have A.D.D., you will when you arrive here on Game Days. It is definitely an oasis on Sundays (and I'm sure every other night of the week). Patrons leave happily satisfied even if their teams lose. Sidenote: Parking is tough as their lot only holds about 16 spots but there is additional parking around the area. This is a GREAT sports bar!! I'd never heard of it before, sadly - but I went there last Sunday for the Hawks first play off game (make sure to go early) because this place was PACKED, but they have TV's everywhere so there isn't a bad seat in the house. They had great drink specials and a huge menu full of yummy greasy typical bar food - but who expects high hopes at a sports bar right? Next sporting event you want to watch, check this place out! I really love Fremont Dock for what it is - a dive bar with a decent kitchen and an outdoor deck. &#160;The staff is great and the patrons always... interesting. &#160;We live down the street and love going on a sunny day to soak up a pitcher and the sunshine on the patio. &#160;I've not had a bad meal yet, either... yeah, it's pub food but the menu is great, prices fair and it's pretty tasty too!I guess they're under new management as of recently - and that might explains ome of the other changes (the pool table is gone and it looks like they might not be doing Karaoke anymore?). Went in on a Sunday night and not much going on. &#160;I went specifically because I was craving a Reuben sandwich and this seemed to be the only place in town open that served them. &#160;The bartender was very unattentive. &#160;She was more into hanging out at a table full of her friends. &#160;The food was okay, nothing special. &#160;After waiting 20 minutes for the check, I finally got up and walked over to her. &#160;Maybe this place would be better with a crowd during a game or something. The menu was much improved from when I was there last. &#160;I used a deal to go here but would definitely head back again and again. Great service at 8am. Food was alright. I'd go again if I was with people who wanted to go there. NFL ticket + Big buck hunter world + great yelp deal + tasty bloody marys + fun crowd &amp; friendly service= A+ all around. &#160;Will be back. Under new ownership. They seem genuine about putting customers' interest first. Menu looks good. I like what the owners said about still tweaking the menu to customers' tastes. I definitely will make this a regular stop. The food is DELICIOUS - you'll just have to wait a while to get it.
My dinner here was the best dinner I've had in a LONG time (I keep saying this about meals, I must have been eating crappy the past few months). Not only was I with 2 of my favorite people in the entire world, but the food was amazing and the service was even better. Our server was this surly, older lady who wasn't afraid to swear and serve us some stiff drinks - and she was hilarious. I was literally in tears because I was laughing so hard. She's like that crazy aunt who sends you a pack of Marlboro Reds and a six pack of PBR for your 16th birthday - and I LOVED her to death. I'm thinking about going there and asking her to adopt me or something. The place was super cute and kitschy. They were playing country music when we walked in, there were some nostalgic movie and country concert posters on the wall, our drinks were served in mason jars and the server (who jots all the orders down on one of those old carbon copy pads) was wearing a red and white checkered shirt with her hair in pigtails. I mean, COME ON! It doesn't get anymore kitschy than that. Besides the cute decor and good old fashioned service, this place serves up some great BBQ. It's not easy to find good BBQ joints in Seattle but this one was the best I've been to. The sweet potato fries were amazing (just a tip - dip them in the mustardy bbq sauce). The sandwich I ordered was perfect - super tender meat, super saucy and messy, just how I like it. If you don't think your meal ALREADY comes with enough BBQ sauce, each table has 3 different BBQ sauces on it &#160;- original, chipotle and mustard. You should probably try them all (I sure did)! Though this place is a bit further than I usually like to venture for food, I WILL be back. That lady has to sign my adoption papers after all. Delish BBQ! I love the simplicity and casualness of this place. Right when you walk in, there are two signs that tell you exactly what to do: "Eating here? Take a seat!" and the other says, "To go? Order here!" We took our seats and ordered away. Sweet tea is awesome, and I love a place that has all their liquor on display along with their different types of unique drinks including Green River! I had to have the 3-item combo: spare ribs, beef brisket and pulled pork with beans and sweet potato fries. Awesome meal, great selection of BBQ sauces, the spicier one being my favorite and plenty of napkins to keep you somewhat decent when you're sucking down food so fast your friends just see blurring motions. A neat little BBQ joint with a bar next door. Certainly worthy of the awards they display on their walls. Every once and a while I get a craving for this place.. really bad!My favorite is Pulled Pork and Jalapeno Spinach Casserole! My hubby digs the catfish plate. It all seems a lil pricey but where else are you going to go that serves good BBQ DINNER in Seattle. All the other good BBQ closes at like 4 or 5pm I think? This is the best that is open and it is pretty dang solid! I love the 3 sauses they provide and that my drink is served in a mason jar. Yummy BBQ. Our friend (from Kansas City) said his only complaint was that the ribs were a bit dry. Diner atmosphere and service (which means not snotty and very quick). Love all their sides, love that everything comes on aluminum dishes (kinda like prison, kinda like camping), and I really love all the gnarly Harley dudes that hang out there. &#160;This is decent Texas-style BBQ.Good drinks too!! This is BBQ at its best. &#160;Well smoked meats, great sauce (all 3 are extremely tasty) and stellar sides, charmingly served with a big ole slice of white bread. &#160;The jalapeno creamed spinach is seriously addictive. &#160;Wash it down with a deliciously sweet-tart cherry limeade. Service is friendly and attentive from a staff of gorgeously tattooed ladies. Can't say that I'm an expert on BBQ, but I know good food when I eat it.I had the combo plate with turkey, chicken and ribs... I noticed that most of the other yelpers reviewing had the same thing (must be popular...) I also had cole slaw and sweet potato fries for sides, and shared a salad with my partner.... More than enough food and a good value. Sweet potato fries were perfect! Nice and crispy. And the salad was great with chicken and BBQ sauce on top.... Yum!I like a semi-sweet sauce, and Pig Iron delivered. Nice to see they have three sauces to choose from on the tables to suit everyone's taste.It's not on the menu, but they definitely have dessert. You can have either red velvet cake or cobbler. The cobbler is really good.... a real butter cake batter crust, not just oatmeal on top!Even if BBQ is not your style, the service will win you over. Extremely genuine and friendly.... The waitress put her hand on my shoulder during our order.... reminded me of Mom.Don't skip this place! I love this place. &#160;Great tender meats, awesome sides--especially the jalapeno spinach casserole, mac'n'cheese, beans, and the great sweet potato fries with chipotle garlic slather! Owners are great, servers nice. Unfortunately they are no longer open for dinner (?), they are always closed now when I go out next door to their other business Slim's Last Chance Saloon for music. &#160; Highly recommend. I'm not from the South (So &#160;Cal doesn't count, does it) but I'm a cook, and this is excellent food. Sauces are great too. GO THERE
Thanks Yelpers. I tried this restaurant for lunch today. I had 2 mahi mahi tacos with rice and beans.Nice.Very friendly people. A line softly coming and going. I didn't know what pupusas were so I watched and asked later.AHH, now I know. Next time. Good ol' home made food + friendly service = a winner.It's easy to walk by this place if you don't know it's there. &#160;Don't make that mistake... &#160; It's on the ground floor of the apartment complex on Brooklyn - you know, the one with all the crazy colors.If you've a hankering for fresh pupusas and fried yucca, you've got to check this place out! I'm so glad I tried this place, but I'm kicking myself because it took me 5+ years of going to the Ave for lunch to notice it. It's sort of off the beaten path of U-District restaurants, in that it's not on the Ave or 45th. You can find it tucked under that garishly colored apartment building on the corner of 41st and Brooklyn. This restaurant was (and still is, I guess) my first exposure to El Salvadorian food. The pupusas, which are these flatbread things made from corn and filled with cheese, vegetables, and chicharr&#243;n, are delicious. They also make some of the best tacos and tamales I've had in the U-District. Prices are pretty decent and service is always prompt and friendly. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the limited seating; if you go on a weekday anytime between 12 and 1, it will be busy and there probably won't be any open tables. I've been to Guanaco's a few times before, but last night I brought a bunch of first-timers and converted them into believers. I always get the veggie sample platter because it gives you a little of everything; a taco, a pupusa, spicy salad, and yucca all for $7. &#160;The U dist. is known for being inexpensive, but this is a quality deal too. The food comes out fast, warm, and spicy. &#160;And their homemade salsas are the savory icing on the proverbial cake. The decor is not super chic, but it does the job.Try fried plantains for dessert. When I walked in they asked if we had ever been with them before because they "do things a little differently." &#160;I was worried by that, but apparently all they meant is that you order up front and grab your own silverware and glass of water, not too uncommon, and totally acceptable when the food is so reasonably priced. &#160;My completely filling meal cost me $7 including the tip.I went with a large group of co-workers around lunch time and it was moderately full, but our food came quite quickly. &#160;They even threw in an extra pupusa so that we were sure to try more than one. &#160;I ordered the grilled plantain topped with cream with a side of refried beans (which are vegetarian by the way). &#160;IT WAS AWESOME. &#160;Everyone else's food looked equally delicious: tasty tacos, burritos, pupusas, tamales, and a plethora of side sauces. &#160;They even came by a couple of times during our short stay just to make sure we were happy, which we were. I love how vegetarian friendly this place is! &#160;I feel like I always miss out at other Latin American places in Seattel. Their outgoing service is as awesome as their food.I'm so happy they're opening up another location in Cap Hill :) Pupusas! Pupusas! Pupusas! And curtido! And tamales!I just had take-out lunch from the new Capitol Hill location, in the hallway shops between Hana sushi &amp; Table 219, on Broadway. It was absolutely delicious! I got three pupusas, the yuca frita, 2 tamales, and a chicken burrito. We loved everything. I'll be returning, often.I have only known about pupusas for over a year. An El Salvadorian lady brings them homemade and sells them where my wife works. I fell head over heels for them. I've been looking for places that sell them for those long draughts between when my wife brings home the homemade ones. Guanaco's Pupuseria fills that bill admirably. And affordably too! 5 stars! I love it. Okay, I admit it. I'd never had Salvadoran food before and that's exactly why I was eager to check it out. As we sat down to read the menu, I got a positive feeling from the sunny, casual atmosphere. There was a wide concrete deck outside, but no setups. I'm hoping when the weather is consistently better, that will be remedied.Whenever I visit this type of restaurant, I order what the place is known for. I figure they better at least get that right. If not, anything else on the menu will be sorely lacking. So I ordered the papusa platter, which came with, well, see one of the attached pictures. There are many options for fillings -- I went for a veggie cheese. The plate also came with an empanada, and I tucked into that little oblong of wonder right after my first taste of the crunchy, fried yuka. It was way better than many of the french fried potatoes I've had in my lifetime. Unfortunately, as one of the owners walked by, he said, "Why are you eating dessert first?" Flushing very slightly with embarrassment, I said I hadn't realized that the empanada was dessert. I kept eating what my dining mate called an inside out egg with its creamy white center anyway. It was too good to put down and as they say, life is short. Eat dessert first. At this restaurant, it certainly makes sense. Really nice Salvadorian food. &#160;Fresh and delicious. &#160;I had the grilled mahi-mahi. &#160;The burrito looked fabulous and there were tonnes of vegetarian options. Awesome Salvadorian cuisine. I can't seem to deviate from the pupusa (w/ everything in it) and the steak taco, but I hear other items are real tasty. I did try the maduros once and liked them.Food is cheap and comes in reasonable quantities. The owner is extremely friendly and goes the extra mile to ensure customer satisfaction. Last week, I ordered a combo to go and arrived home to discover that it was missing beans and rice. I called the owner to tell him -- he told me my next meal would be free. I came in just a few days ago and he quickly matched my face to my voice and complaint and told me right off the bat that my meal was free. Great food. Great service. I actually need to stop myself from going there more often as I do t want to burn myself out on it. The empinadas are great. The fried yuka is always a treat and the sour kraut on the tacos I could probably eat out of a jar. Big yum The Pupusas here make for a great, cheap lunch. &#160;I haven't tried too many things here, but why would I stray from my chicken, bean, zucchini, and cheese pupusas? &#160;The staff has always been friendly. Seattle can be a real disappointment when it comes to food, but not at Guanaco's Tacos on Capitol Hill. &#160;This cosy location on Broadway seats about 45 snugly and is filled with delightful aromas. Their operation is simple and is some of the best, delicious and exciting food in the neighborhood. &#160;The tamales have rich flavor and warm moist masa, it's a winner. &#160;The empanadas were perfect, crisp and filled with perfectly spiced, savory meat. &#160;But hands down, this restaurant may have some of the best pupusas north of quite a few boarders. &#160;Absolutely heavenly, light, crisp, fresh and is the product of someone who really lives to cook. &#160;Guanaco's Tacos is a rare place that puts its heart on its plates, and is filled to the brim with soul. &#160;Plus, they have a veggi menu too! &#160;Don't pass up the opportunity to enjoy this fantastic spot, when you leave you will feel like you are best friends with the chefs, even if you never see them! People posting about how greay the food is are correct. &#160;And that is not a bad thing. &#160;The grease gives those little pupusas their flavor. &#160;Yum in the tum. &#160;Ill write a more in depth review after I've sampled more of their menu,
-1 star due to smaller portions.We placed a large take out order (1 special combo, 1 veggie, and 1 lamb tibs). It was about $50 which isn't bad considering that 1 combo can feed 3-4ppl.It was disappointing. The veggie combo was extremely light, lacking heft and quantity. The lamb tibs amount was just ok, could have done for more spice and chopped jalapeno. The special combo was of medium heft but was jammed packed with flavor (which is always the case with the meat dishes). Loved the chicken drumstick and hardboiled egg. &#160;But still, 3 meals barely fed 4 hungry adults and 2 children. I mean, for the price point, it's still a good deal, but comparing to how we knew things used to be, this was a bit hard to swallow.This is in parallel to an eat-in experience with 4 adults and 2 combos a few months prior. In addition to the smaller portions, service was well meaning, but not fulfilled. I had asked for small plates for us all instead of using napkins to rest our injera on (or the edge of the large saucer plates) and received one small bowl. When I repeated my request, the bowl was taken away and one small plate appeared. By then it was about halfway through our meal so I gave up.I will continue to have a soft spot for Awash as my very first Ethiopian experience, but seeing as I have a few closer good contenders, we probably won't be visiting Awash for a while. Thanks for the memories!
This is the best Mexican food in Seattle in my opinion. It's simple, it's delicious and it's just better than it has any right to be. The burritos are seasoned just right with enough different flavors that it's not just rice and beans, but enough tang and spice to make you realize you're having an authentic burrito and not just another chipotle burrito. This is my favorite taco truck in Seattle. &#160;I always get the same thing - vegetarian Rice &amp; Bean Bowl, and it's SO GOOD! &#160;And at less than $6, it's CHEAP. &#160;The veggies are always fresh, the guacamole is homemade, and it's the perfect amount of food for me. &#160;Outdoor seating is available if you can't wait until you get home to eat your grub! &#160;Check it out! Yummm!!! The burritos are huge and amazingggg, and the horchata is delicious! The only thing bad about this place is that since it's a taco truck, there's limited seating. And it's a popular place! But i would definitely choose Rancho Bravo over Chipotle ANY DAY! Even my parents, who are NOT fans of Mexican food, love this place! This is always one of the stops that we HAVE to make when they stop by Seattle. The food is cheap and delicious, and you get your food super fast! I just had a burrito here earlier today, delicious as always. But now i'm hungry for another one after writing this review.... If you don't like Rancho Bravo, it's probably because you haven't been there. Sure it looks a little sketchy from the outside, and even from the inside, but you're not seeing it for the treasure it really is.All the quality you'd expect from a kickass taco truck with prices to match, and with the charming ambiance of a hollowed out KFC.Tip: the food is better in the afternoon, evening, or very late. I would go for early lunch sometimes and things were a bit more dry and they didn't seem to be in their full swing.Rancho Bravo is easily in my top 10 Seattle-area restaurants for price/quality. i have an addiction to taco trucks after spending a few years in walla walla where they seem to be on every corner and are always amazing and cheap.when i moved back to seattle, i was fairly dissapointed in the mexican food i found here (both price and quality). that being said, rancho bravo has made me one happy late night diner. all the food is awesome and with such a huge selection of menu items and tasty meat options, there is something here for everyone! plus they are open until 2 on the weekends and there is a space to sit down and eat. food is fast, tasty, and substantial. love the torta- perfect for the person who has hit a few bars and isn't looking for deepfried bar food and only 4 bucks. The value of this place cannot be beat! My $2.24 carne taco was one of the best I've had! yeah... i would NOT go here to order vegetarian tacos. &#160;this is a taco truck run my Mexicans. They specialize in MEAT. &#160;their Carne Asada tacos are some of the best i've ever had.oh. try the Agua de Pina. &#160;For those who don't know, that means "Water of Pineapple."get a LARGE one. you won't be sorry! In Seattle, we are seriously short on street food and that applies all over town it seems. &#160;However this place stands out as one of the best Taco stands around town, it's located about &#160;1/2 block east of the Dicks on 45th street. &#160;I always order the cow tongue burrito which has a nice chewy texture along with the beans and rice makes it quite heavenly. &#160;Oh yeah, the price is also very cheap, it came to just 5 dollars and some change. &#160;There isn't really a place to sit, there is only one picnic table but that does not bother me, I usually take mine togo. Rancho Bravo Tacos is, to me, a little slice of taco heaven. &#160;It is a greasy looking truck in an abandoned Winchell's parking lot; how could it be anything less than wonderful? &#160;I come here regularly because I live only a few blocks away, but these tacos are better than any other taco truck in Seattle, and worth traveling for. &#160;I will admit that sometimes the food is hit or miss, but I honestly can't complain. &#160;The tacos are frequently overflowing with meat, cilantro and onions. &#160;Especially delicious is the al pastor, the tongue (lengua), and the fish (pescado). &#160;The green sauce is divine and is often very spicy, and all of the other sauces are great too. &#160;You get little slices of lime on the side! &#160;Perfection.I always order tacos at the taco truck, but honestly everything is delightful, even on less than stellar days. &#160;The quesadillas are cheesy, the burritos are huge, the tamales are -to die for-. &#160;Horchata gets an A++. &#160;I can't say enough good things about this place. &#160;There have been times that I have been slightly disappointed with my food, but it is always better than anything else I could get in the neighborhood. &#160;Plus, it cures even the worst hangover. Tasty...(although sometimes fatty) classic carnitas tacos.Can't go wrong with the tamales either.Rice bowls are awesome...Whom I kidding, this place is great. This roach coach is soooooo good! I'm from California and Mexican and this is so far the best Mexican burrito in Seattle! I've heard these trucks referred to as many horrible nicknames but this truck is anything but that. Quick service and incredible food makes for a wonderful experience whether you eat there or carry out.If you can get past what it is the tongue sandwich is to die for!! My goodness, taco truck.Yes, $2 tacos please. And that hot sauce that tastes like a spicy hug on my tongue.I mean, it's just plain good tacos and plain good burritos from a truck in a parking lot. Not much more to say about it aside from the fact that it's totally delicious. F***ing love this place. &#160;Cheap, yummy burritos and tacos! &#160;Need I say more??? Yumminess from a truck. For a quick, inexpensive, and yet tasty meal, Rancho Bravo should be your "truck" of choice. We enjoy the carnitas with black bean burritos and the tamales. Unlike the majority of Mexican/faux Mexican restaurants in Seattle that bury a tortilla under melted cheese, Rancho Bravo actually lets you taste the flavor of the actual ingredients. For that quick bite, skip Dick's and go to the truck. my pulled pork burrito was ok, kind of dry and not much meat. &#160;I had a much burrito last week at the Tacos el Azadero truck on Rainier Ave. Rancho Bravo= taco truck turned restaurant (in KFC's old spot) Cheap, filling, open late, Mexi-coke, delicious salsas; need I say more? Easy to miss taco truck but one of the best... &#160;love their tacos and always cheap late night food... makes me feel better than eating a greasy Dicks hamburger next door... Not a bad taco joint. &#160;Pretty tasty beef-tongue burrito. &#160;It's not like the other ones I've tried where it's like you are making out with a cow.They have that Spanish rice drink "Horchata" -- it ain't bad. Rancho Bravo "popped" my beef tongue "cherry" and it was a great experience.Very cheap, very tasty and quite fast.Sorry.Pork Tamales - DELICIOUS, masa a little salty (I've never tasted salty/flavored masa) but for $1.75 you can't go wrong. I'm from Phoenix and I've had tons of tamales - this place nearly beats them all.The Posole is good too, as well as the Horchata! I love these guys!I have been eating at taco trucks before it was cool to eat at taco trucks. Way back in high school as a member of the Spanish club I planned and executed a taco truck day at school. I had to go to eastern Washington and pay a guy 500 bucks just to get him to come to Everett for a day and sell us food for two hours. But as everyone now knows taco trucks are amazing. Or can be. There are some bad ones out there. We have all been to one I am sure. Rancho Bravo Tacos are some of the very best in Seattle if not the best. Let me break it down for you:1. Carne Asada and Chicken tacos- Meat is perfectly seasoned. Not over cooked. There is tons of meat per taco too and just enough cilantro, lime, onions and radishes for a little flavor. 2. Fish tacos- No deep fried fish here. Nice grilled fish (talipa? cod?). The pickled veg on top gives it a nice little extra zest of flavor too. 3. Pork Tamales- How can I love another? Perfectly seasoned roasted pork stuffed inside fluffy masa and then steamed to perfection. Never dried out or too watery. Throw on a splash of lime and it is a party in your mouth every time. Truly the best tamale ever!!!4. Carne Asada Torta- The meat of course is the same as the taco meat so that is perfect. Nice fresh crispy veggies, just the right amount of mayo all on a buttery roll. 5. Drinks- Both the Agua de Pina and the Horchata are excellent. The Agua de Pina isn't too sweet making it a lovely summer drink on a hot afternoon. The horchata is rich and flavorful but refreshing without that griminess that sometimes comes with horchata. Not only that the staff is friendly, helpful and they get your order to you fast. Last week I ordered 12 tacos, two tamales, one torta and two drinks and they had our food to us under ten minutes. NiceI only take off one star because they do not have sopes. Sopes are my favorite taco truck food. If only they had a sope I bet it would be amazing and thus they would earn that last star as well as my heart. I love this taco truck. &#160;My friends and I are here about once a week and every time it hits the spot. &#160;Unfortunately I'm gluten free and can't partake of the wonderful burritos I hear about, but their tacos are phenomenal. &#160;The fish and the chicken are perfect. &#160;And they have MexiCoke. &#160;The real Coke! &#160;Mmmmm!! Pros: Quick ordering and pick up even when they were very busy on a hot summer night; tasty rice and bean bowl with seasoned pork; location can't be beat if you live near Wallingford.Cons: Paid a buck extra for guac, but didn't get it. Also did not get forks, and when we returned to ask for them, they looked at us like we were crazy and it took several minutes to get them.But really, these things aren't that big of a deal. The reason I didn't give 5 is because the cap hill location seemed like it had better grub. SO GOOD. I've always loved taco truck tacos and these are no different. The tortillas have that unique delightful taste and the ingredients are so fresh. The veggie tacos are far superior to any other tacos I've had (even Chipotle!!!) &#160;GO HERE!!!!!! Mmmm, have been meaning to try this place out and finally got around to it tonight. Even though they'd just closed for the evening they still served our to go order since they hadn't turned off their 'Open' sign. Super nice about it.Had spiced carnitas and chicken tacos = amazing. Super fresh and tasty. My dining companion had the beef burrito which was also good.Can't beat the price, taste, and speed of this place. Simply amazing burritos ! Personal favorite is the Bravo Burrito. With the verde sauce (thats the green one right??) For $4.50 you can have a whole meal and with all the money you saved going elsewhere (maybe even Dicks!) you can spring for some guac or even whole avocado slices to take your mouth party to the next level. have NEVER been disappointed I went here.Oh, and make sure you bring a Tide stain pen, these burritos make the queen loose her manners. Great food, simple menu, good prices, and quick service. This is my kinda place.The tacos and burritos are superb and next time I'm trying a torta for sure. They offer chicken, mole chicken, al pastor, carnitas, asada, and lengua, pescado, or tripa for 50 cents extra. They also have a veggie mix with mushrooms and a bunch of other flavorful vegetables if you're not in a meat mood.Seattle seriously needs more food trucks like this. I was Portland this past week and it is a food cart paradise. They're scattered all over Portland and there are even little "food courts" with 4 or 5 stationary carts in a circle with seating in the middle. So good. Seattle needs to step up it's game. Thank god for rancho bravo.
This place is amazing!! I'd never been, and the boyfriend just RAVES about this place, so one day we decided to come here together.WOW!! I can't remember the name of the torta I got but I don't think it matters. The food here is just incredible! The pickled veggies suit the tortas absolutely perfectly and the breaded steak melts in your mouth! It is easy to drive past, but so worth the trek from West Seattle for the food as well as the friendly atmosphere. These tortas are so damn good I can't stand it! &#160;The food is rich and delicious and the service is great! The only downside is that I should only visit this cart once a month at the most if I don't want a spare tire. If you DO want a spare tire and love every minute of it, visit this cart daily! It's AMAZING!!!!! ***** Food Truck Review*******This review is for the Toloquena sandwich. I suppose there are other sandwiches on the menu, but from my experience, they aren't very good. The Toloquena though is amazing. I don't like to use the term "life changing" but..... I think it's life changing. It's definitely addicting. I just had one a few weeks ago before a Sounders game, and then I needed another one. My boyfriend hadn't tried the Toloquena before, so based off previous visits to Barriga Llena, he wasn't really a fan. Usually he would get food at one of the other trucks. Last night though, he tried the Toloquena.... and it converted him. Now he loves it. I would avoid the breaded steak, it's not good. The carne asada and the chorizo are both fantastic though. The salsa is soooooooo good. Last night I put a little too much on it and burned my white girl tongue, but I would do that again, because it was still delicious. Only 4 stars though because $9 is still a bit high for a medium sized sandwich served out of a truck outside a Soccer Match. Plus, none of the other sandwiches are good. You'd never find the place if you weren't looking, but you should check it out. &#160;Family owned, and they let you know that. &#160;Husband/co-owner is from Guadalajara and knows how to cook his native food. &#160;Wife/co-owner is great and can give you a rundown on the menu if you are an amateur.The mole was absolutely outstanding. &#160;Take the time to check this place out if you are in the area and like authentic central Mexico cuisine. I sooo miss the Barriga Llena in Federal Way (it took awhile but I eventually fell in love). &#160;These are absolutely the best tortas I've ever had. &#160;I was craving a Diablo -so made DH pull off the freeway for lunch. &#160;It met my expectations and more - even better than I remember........ (This review is for their food truck)At the suggestion of the truck operator, I got the Barrigona ($9): breaded steak, homemade chorizo, pork leg steak, sausage, and cheese inside a round sandwich roll (telera or bolillo). This torta also includes tomato, avocado, lettuce, and mayonnaise.For what was in the sandwich, I expected a multitude of flavors to bombard me like I was the target of some U.S. missile attack. Unfortunately, I got the flavor equivalent of a one-man army carrying a water pistol. A fairly huge letdown here.Half the steak was tough to eat, while the other half was tender and had some flavor. The chorizo, pork, and sausage didn't bring much taste to the dance. While I enjoyed the lovely pressed bread (and the grill marks on the outside), the sandwich was near-impossible to pick up and eat. I resorted to a fork to help make a dent on this one.I will put in a good word for the pickled jalapenos and the smoky chipotle sauce. Both condiments livened things up and made the experience more palatable.It was a nice-sized sandwich, and for that, I can understand the $9 price tag. But as far as flavors are concerned, I thought their signature torta came up short. Seems like fantastic comfort food. There are quite a few tortas to choose from, but I split the house special with my husband. The Barrigona, has Breaded steak, Chorizo, sausage, pork leg plus cheese. All the tortas come topped with beans lettuce onions and avocado. This was my first time having a torta and it was wonderful. The torta was huge, and I love the grilled bread. There is a smoky chipotle salsa and spicy pickled jalapenos and carrots at the tables. Both make a nice addition to the torta. We were the only ones in the place on a sunday mid-morning. We talked to the owner, who was extremely and friendly. He told us about his Federal Way shop and his foodtruck at the Sounders games. Will definitely go back again! This place is awesome. I thought I was pretty familiar with Tortas (being probably my favorite sandwich format ever), but found a bunch of items on the menu that were brand new to me. I convinced my girlfriend to try the Argentina torta, having never tried breaded steak before, and found it to be delicious- definitely something I would be eating on a regular basis if only I lived anywhere near Seattle. I had to try the Tapatia, which basically sounded like a carnitas torta with some spicy sauce on it- how can you go wrong with that? The guy behind the counter warned me that it was spicy; do not worry, I foolishly boasted, I can handle spicy. When my sandwich arrived, just the sight of it nearly knocked my foolish pride down a notch. This torta is literally soaking in a very spicy sauce, the likes of which I have yet to encounter in my 27 years as a Mexican food loving gringo. With the first bite I knew I'd be in for a challenge to finish the whole thing despite being completely staving from a day of walking around town. However, I did manage to finish it, with many pauses to pat the sweat off my face with several napkins (no joke). Not only that, but I can't wait until I'm back in Seattle so I can another one. The Tapatia is definitely hot, but it's not the kind of thing you eat just for novelty's sake or bragging rights- it's damn good. The spicy sauce has a delicious complexity behind the heat, and the pork is clearly tender and juicy even before it gets doused in it. Although I want to try just about everything else on the menu, especially the Barrigona, the Tapatia was what really sold me on Barriga Llena. It is truly an awesome sandwich. Barriga Llena has definately reserved a spot on the long list of what makes Seattle awesome. With all of that said, I do have one suggestion on how this place can improve- please please please consider opening a location in Portland! I am so happy that Barriga Llena has a mobile food cart now so I can enjoy their delicious tortas in more than one spot! The caribe&#241;a takes pineapple, cheese, and pork to a level no Hawaiian pizza ever could on a bun of toasty goodness. Their house made chorizo is incredible! Not too spicy but so flavorful it creates a party of meat and melted cheese in your mouth you won't soon forget! Get a torta, you know you want one. I went back there this weekend and my cow steak-pork leg torta was incredible. The service was good and fast. They added new tortas to the menu and they now sell beer. &#160;The owners have a great little grocery store next door, if you are looking to continue your Mexican food journey at home. I had the pleasure of trying out Barriga Llena at the Seattle Center recently for their mobile chowdown thingy. This is def the best torta I have had, the thing was freakin huge and I am glad I had a friend with me to split it with, however it was so good I kinda wanted the whole thing! It was drippy, and juicy and spicy and, hot dang I think I need to get in my car and got get one RIGHT NOW! My review is for their truck that is out in front of Starbucks Corporate office. 2 days, 2 tortas, and very happy with the portions, service, and quality of the food. Had the Mazatlan one day and the Toluquena the next. Both very good in my opinion. This review is for the Greenlake location. &#160;I was in desperate need of comfort food from home (Mexico), so I decided to try this place that another Mexican friend had already recommended. I came to the right place! I had a Hawaiiana torta (without ham because I'm vegetarian) and was transported back to Mexico City. Loved it!
Well I was walking down the street just a-having a think, when a snake of a guy gave me an evil winkHe shook me up,(shimmy with the shoulders) he took me by surpriseHe had a pickup truck and the devil's eyes! (close up of eyes run fingers across them)He stared at me and I felt a changeTime meant nothing, never would again (loud shriek)This isn't just an impromptu Rocky Horror reference. I was walking through Seatlle, without an umbrella, which for some odd reason nobody uses one even though it rains 24/7 here, and a drag show poster catches my eye. Since I was sight seeing with two other tourists, might as well stop in for a drink.It happened to be Rocky Horror themed, which I'm a sucker for this gimmick. A restaurant after my own heart. We ate the disgusting nachos. And yes it's true, once you get past LA don't even think about trying Mexican inspired cuisine. You are eating mayonaise with food coloring.The drinks were awesome though. Very strong and delicious for noon time. I had two totally gays (yes this was the name of the drink) and felt my hand curling slightly. I felt at ease since I had taken a road trip so far away from my gayborhood and now found myself in another gayborhood in another city. We vowed to catch the drag show later that night, but Kelly got caught up with the fish throwers in Pikes Market, while I drank Hennesey and wondered the streets of downtown.Now all we have left is this review and a picture with a cross-dressing mannequin. *sigh* So two of the times I've come here and ordered coffee thay have been out of soy milk, I'm sorry, but OUT of soy milk! On Capitol Hill with vegan items on the menue... I am NOT OK with that!I like their BRUNCH, it's amazing... but wait times and so on... and the lack of soymilk totally brought down my love for this place! I liked my omelet. I liked our brunch experience. Their physiques omelet met my random requirements- it had egg whites, lean turkey sausage, marinara, and mozzarella with black beans instead of toast and potatoes. My brother digged his stuffed French toast- thick, moist, and light. I saw other options that sounded great too, but I am on detox and only doing lean proteins and veggies- bummer... We showed up at about 11am and the restaurant was about 1/3 full- I hadn't expected this- Does Cap Hill eat brunch later? Our server was attentive and my water stayed topped off. I saw they served cafe vita coffee and I was tempted to get a cup until I saw the price. I've also been here a couple times for the show :) Once I did the great coffee and cold weather spiked drinks... yum... and the other I did the show special... which resulted in a $50 tab and buying numerous drinks for others... those drinks are sneaky. We ate here the other day and I thought it was ok. &#160;The pizza was thick and dry- hardly any sauce, not too good. &#160;The fish and chips were good and the service was decent as well. &#160;I don't know if I'd go back. Met up with some friends there for an early lunch. We were seated outside and the service was a bit slow. What really got me was that mid way through our meal, they turned on the music on the speakers and it was so loud that it almost drowned out our conversation. &#160;The food was ok - nothing really exciting. I'm not sure why Julia's on Broadway is so disliked. It's a mystery to me. &#160;I've been coming here for years and I've never been disappointed with the food or the service...As a breakfast/brunch place it's simply wonderful - huge portions, good sides and extras, nice choice of entrees and very good eggs benedict IMHO. &#160;The lattes are also quite exquisite - Caffe Vitta, yum.I used to consistently order the benedicts, but lately I yearn for veggies with my protein in the morning so I tend to get the sauteed vegetables &amp; potatoes with one easy egg on the side. The veggies are never overcooked and are tastily dressed with soy and garlic. &#160;I also really like their heuvo rancheros. Boyfriend always orders the Socrates scramble omlette thingy and he loves it...I've sampled lunch here (great sandwiches, especially the 1000 calorie crab sandwich) and also dinner and quite liked everything I've eaten here.The ambience is lovely - solid wooden furniture and baroque embellishments everywhere. &#160;Best of all are the two outdoor areas for warmer weather dining. &#160;The service has been consistently good as well, your typical Hill savoire / laissez faire. And for brunch there's almost never a wait for a table!And something I used to just LOVE? Once, they had these red velvet booths, and one of the coffee tables had drawers and inside those drawers are sweet, hilarious, heartfelt missives, drawings and quotes on pieces of paper penned and left by random past diners...What was not to love - food and entertainment at brunch! If the waiter hadn't of been so busy chatting up a guy at the bar, the food might not have been cold by the time it got to us. You could hear the chef in the kitchen ding the "come get the food" bell. Not once, not twice, but about five times. The last time he came out of the kitchen and glared at the waiter....who didn't move. By the time it got to me, my veggies were cold and the demi glaze sauce for my steak had turned to jelly. The steak probably started out medium rare when it was ready, but by the time the waiter picked it up it was almost well done. In addition, he also stopped us on our way out the door...not to say sorry for the bad service, but to get more money from us because he forgot to include the corkage fee in the bill. WTF? Fire the waiter and I might be back. Awful awful awful service from a guy who thinks because he's a pretty boy he can hang around and flirt instead of doing his job. WHY!?!, WHY!?!, why did I not read the Yelp reviews before wasting my time and money on this place.Food was decent, but as my date so appropriately stated, "This food makes my belly fart." &#160;Got a bit of indigestion from this place, which wouldn't be a deal-breaker if there had been at least decent service. &#160;Got our food quick enough but trying to get an extra napkin and a glass of ice for our warm water had me resorting to getting up from the table and asking the bartender for them.Oh well, at least now I get to write a review of it and hopefully the next person will look before they eat. &#160;Thank god for Yelp, when you are wise enough to use. I used to live right around the corner from here and have eaten there many times.I think the downfall at Julia's is that looking from the outside in, you expect so much more. They do a decent job at everything and you'll not be dissapointed.However, i cannot say that I ever walked away.. impressed with the service, food, etc...
I found a new go-to banh mi spot!Don't get me wrong, I'll always have a soft spot for Seattle Deli. However, Saigon Deli makes a mean grilled pork banh mi. This sandwich is perfection, from the bread to the portion of veggies and meat. I read from another review to ask for extra pate and had a total foodgasm when I did. &#160;Even though Saigon's sandwich does cost slightly more than Seattle Deli, it's totally worth the extra change (and walk from work).Another thing I love about this place is that they serve Vietnamese coffee. I never tried to order it at Seattle Deli but I love how it's available at Saigon Deli. But anyways, anything with condensed milk is heavenly to me.I can't speak for the rest of the food but I shall update this review when I do get the chance. It may be awhile since I still crave for their grilled pork banh mi. Oh my! One of my phovorite delis pho sure!Outstanding banh mi and other Vietnamese foods and beverages, with great prices. You can leave his place with a bag full of lunch, drinks and snacks for under $10! Photastic!I like their bbq pork banh mi a lot, but other ones are good too. The service here is also very good. The food always seems to be on the fresh side compared to other delis I've frequented. The service here is very good. It can be busy here during lunch, but they always do a good job of keeping the food and people moving. There's even parking here! Not to be confused with Siagon Vietnam Deli just around the corner on Jackson and 12th, this is my go-to spot for bahn mi. I actually think I have a bit of a problem, to be quite frank. For less than four dollars, each sandwich is prepared on fresh toasted bread with fantastic ingredients and I've never had a complaint. Unlike other shops in the vicinity, this is the one that I always trust. The shop itself is a little bit less clean and orderly than some, and the workers can be a bit surly, but I've never spotted or noticed poor glove etiquette or other sanitation issues (aside from packaging techniques and food left on the counter, but I don't know what the regulations are so I keep my mouth shut). Four stars for - quality and taste of ingredients, freshness and choice of bread, ease of location, and being wallet friendly. Not a sit down restaurant at all, take your stuff and leave. And be so, so happy you did! Yummy Vietnamese sandwiches!! I was looking for a good bakery so that my husband can try Banh Mi for the fist time. This place looked authentic and had good reviews, and it definitely gave me what I wanted. I had a three-ham sandwich and my husband tried their BBQ pork. They were both very tasty! I will definitely come back to this place. Ridiculously cheap with $3.00 Bahn miwiches, but not as incredibly delicious as isandwich Bahn-miwichery up on the 99 and 145.. &#160;This is a Vietnamese deli, chock-full of interesting nibblets and snacks at dirt-cheap prices. &#160;No seating. &#160;The pork Bahn miwich wasa tiny bit gristly, but chock full of vegetables and herbs. &#160;Cold prawn 'n' pork spring rolls are mediocre.
After three weeks in Japan, I got home with a deep hankering for gooooood ramen. Fu Lin satiated me with rich broth, slurpable noodles, and fresh toppings. Bring on the Miso Ramen! &#160;One star above the Soy Sauce Ramen broth ('lil watery) and the Tonkatsu Ramen broth. And the food was out lickety split. Gyoza were good too -- lightly charred gyoza wrapper and juicy filling, lined up like dominos. The juicy pork buns were neither buns nor very porky, resemblign won-tons only filled up with scalding liquid. Beware fellow yelpers! Although Fu Lin is known for the Ramen, the Beef Broccoli entree was fairly good, mainly because the crisp broccoli tasted freshly picked. Fun tidbit: They have Asian magazines stacked up by the door, which were neat to flip through. Next up: Samurai Ramen. Oh it is on. There's no option &#160;to do so, but I give this place 3.5 stars.There's some hype here on Yelp- best gyoza, best ramen in Seattle, etc. &#160;Well, it's pretty good, I guess.I ordered a "soy sauce tonkatsu ramen", or something to that effect. &#160;My favorite part was that, unlike a Vietnamese restaurant, the pork was actually pretty lean. &#160; The pork was barbecue pork style, not katsu style.The rest of the ramen bowl was pretty standard, and flavored nicely. &#160;But I couldn't help wondering whether I could take Top Ramen and throw it into real chicken soup and make something JUST as good. &#160;Again, I can't really complain- a massive bowl was only $5.75.The potstickers are also pretty good- not spectacular - but rather small. &#160;Little dishes are provided, but the only sauce is soy sauce and hot sauce- I rather like a vinegary potsticker sauce, but for $3.50, I still cannot complain.At the end of the meal, our bill was 'accidentally' increased by 30%, and the error was not explained to us. &#160;It was fixed, but given that the bill is not itemized AND is written in a foreign language, it wasn't very confidence-inspiring.Overall, I'd eat here if I were in the neighborhood, but wouldn't make a special trip. It seems that this place is a combination of Japanese and Chinese specialties all wrapped into one menu. &#160;Its not fusion, but an establishment well respected for its lunch specials, plentiful portions, reasonable prices, and some of the most delectable ramen variety one can find.Other than the ramen, there isn't much going on here. &#160;The menu seems to be very simple and intended for the quick but hearty meal goers. &#160;the BBQ pork is fresh and tasty and the noodles of the ramen were nice but not as great as I thought it was going to be. &#160;Perhaps it was the hype, but I will most definitely stop by again for the quick meal. &#160;Afterall, it was only $5.00. After reading the reviews here I was really expecting something great. &#160;Unfortunately I was really underwhelmed.I have to admit I went seeking only ramen and that's all I ordered, but the ramen I had was really nothing special. &#160;It had a very oily taste to the base and didn't give that light but very filling feeling that good ramen usually leaves in your stomach.To be fair they had quite a few dishes on the menu, but given the flavor of the ramen and the absolute crawl of the service there, I really am not interested in going again. You can spot me here everytime I'm in town. &#160;This restaurant is a "chuka ryori" style which means they make Chinese food in Japanese style. &#160;I absolutely love their "miso corn and seaweed ramen." &#160;It reminds me of the ramen I had in Japan. &#160;I would also recommend their mapo tofu and spring roll. &#160;Too bad I can't try their gyoza since it has meat in it but it claims to be the best food from the restaurant according to my friends. Huh? This is not like the ramen &#160;you get in Japan. &#160;I got the Shoyu Ramen and hubby had the Tonkotsu Ramen. &#160;Shoyu ramen tasted like...shoyu. &#160;Nothing special. &#160;Tonkotsu ramen's broth was light but lack the pork flavor that makes a good good tonkotu broth. &#160;Gyoza was $2.50 extra. &#160; This is so far the best ramen place in Seattle that I've tried, but that doesn't really mean much. &#160;Maybe I should try the Miso Ramen next time.
Wow! &#160;This space is simply gorgeous. &#160;Just go for yourself to check it out. &#160;You'll probably see me there staring dreamily out into the courtyard while noshing on a roll or two.JP and I checked out the newest addition to the Hill (super stoked, 3 new places opened in one week) and gave our nod of approval. &#160;We both really like Umi so we knew conceptually things would be sound. &#160;The restaurant has 3 different spaces...the front area where you walk in contains the bar and lots of wood/paper decor and is on the darker side, a great place to meet up for a pre-dinner cocktail. &#160;Then you proceed down a hallway which takes you to a brighter room with the sushi bar and lastly down another hallway strolling past the beautiful courtyard to a softly lit back dining room. &#160;We were seated at a 2 top and brought water and edamame. &#160;They have an extensive selection of Sake on their drink menu as well as creative cocktails. &#160;Their wine selection is small (3-4 whites and the same for reds IIRC). &#160;JP ordered the Bourbon Julep which arrived in a julep cup! &#160;He loved his drink. &#160;Once drinks were ordered we started to pour over the large menu. &#160;Seriously, the options were endless and a bit overwhelming. &#160;There are so many different directions you could take your order. &#160;We ordered one item off the kaiseki menu, the dynamite bake, nigiri off the fresh sheet (SO good), and 2 rolls: &#160;the Sounder (a must get) and the Tarantula which was good but I wouldn't order it again with so many options. &#160;Our overall experience was fantastic, especially considering they had only been open 3 nights and it was our server's second day. &#160;I know Momiji will become one our hood staples. pricey but super fresh and delicious. Beautifully sophisticated decor and design. I went to Momiji yesterday from happy hour (4-6, or 4-7 at the bar proper) and had a good time.Service was timely and friendly. The rolls we ordered (Crunchy Seattle Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll) were very much equivalent to those at Umi, their sister restaurant in Belltown--that is to say, the rolls were pedestrian but delicious. I cannot speak for their nigiri/sashimi, as I haven't ordered any of it and wouldn't feel comfortable enough reviewing it had I ordered it (I'm a sushi newbie).Momiji's decor is a highlight of the place. It's very modern and full of medium/dark-toned woods. The music isn't too loud or too weak.The beer I ordered (an IPA on happy hour special at $3.50) was served to me in a glass that appeared to be less than a pint (perhaps 12-14oz.) but I cannot be sure. Their beer list is average...there are some microbrews such as Manny's on tap, as well as Japanese lagers that you would expect.Our bill totaled $30 (for two people at happy hour), which I think is very reasonable, especially considering the good service and beautiful decor/environs. My girlfriend and I just ate here and loved it. &#160;We both are huge fans of Umi and were happy to hear that the owners were opening a new sushi place on the hill right down the street from us. &#160;They have many of the favorite rolls from Umi, but an extensive new variety as well. &#160;The ambiance is a little less noisey then Umi, a great place for a casual or slightly more romantic setting. &#160;Loved the beautiful zen garden in the middle! Possibly now the best place on the hill to get sushi. Two thumbs way up! We'll definitely be back!! A BEAUTIFUL place to get together with friends to drink and munch on some crazy named makis. &#160;Friendly service, Delicious Food, Great Location! My boyfriend and I went there last night excited to try the new restaurant after walking by several times as it was being finished. &#160;There are three areas to the restaurant, but it doesn't feel like a large restaurant - the front bar area, the middle area with a partially open kitchen, and the back area with a courtyard between the back and middle sections. &#160;You're brought a plate of edamame as an appetizer. &#160;We also had miso soup and the Momiji Sashimi sampler. &#160;Then the roles! &#160;My boyfriend cannot eat shellfish so he had the Crispy Seattle, which was excellent especially if you like a little fried flavor. &#160;Our server was attentive and polite and made a delicious suggestion for me: the Three Devils role, which my boyfriend was also able to share because it was shellfish-free. It was fresh and delicious - a wonderful and thoughtful suggestion.The prices are reasonable. &#160;The menu is terrific. Overall a great experience and we will be back. The sushi was awesome. &#160;I had the capitol hill roll and loved it. &#160;We also had a king crab tower for an app (not sure of the name) which was also delicious. &#160;Only problem was that my date had the yakiudon noodles because he wanted something hot and they were pretty bad. &#160;Very very bland. &#160;I'll go there for sushi but I do not recommend the noodles. Capitol Hill finally has a serious sushi place, in a beautiful space on 12th Ave. &#160;There is a decent sized bar in the front, but in back there is a beautiful courtyard garden (how much does the rock weigh?). &#160;And I loved the details throughout the restaurant - the Nakashima tables with the beveled edges, the Japanese roof shingles you can see in the courtyard, and the unique front door.Just like Umi, the menu here is segmented into a zillion sections - &#160;fried, raw, pan-fried, grilled, steamed, salad, baked, noodles, soups, and then there is finally the sushi menu. &#160;And then there is a separate kaiseki menu, which is not kaiseki in the sense of a course, but a menu prepared by a different chef, using seasonal ingredients and with kaiseki presentation (strings beans tied into a beautiful ribbon!).Started off with Jalapeno Hamachi, which was yellowtail sashimi, jalape&#241;o, garlic, cilantro with a yuzu citrus ponzu. &#160;The sashimi was definitely very fresh, but the jalapeno was a little too hot, as there were tons of seeds, which I probably would have removed. &#160;We then tried an assortment of sushi - tuna, wild sockeye salmon, and Spanish mackerel, of which the mackerel was outstanding, &#160;My only pet peeve is that the rice was a little hard and could have been cooked and seasoned a little better, but there are only a couple places in Seattle that I have found that do the rice properly. &#160;We also ordered a Moonraker roll spicy yellowtail, cucumber &amp; cilantro with seared spicy snow crab mix &amp; black tobiko, avocado dressed with jalape&#241;o-citrus sauce, truffle oil &amp; green onions. &#160;Ok - so it sounds a little over the top and at $16 it's not exactly cheap, but it was very tasty and the portion was generous.We next tried a couple of items from the kaiseki menu including a grilled yellowtail and braised pork kakuni. &#160;The taste and presentation were very authentic, and I would have loved to have seen a prix fixe menu offered from the this menu.Like Umi, the sake selection here is excellent and among the best in town with plenty of options by the glass as well as in full and half bottles. &#160;We tried a couple of half bottles, and really enjoyed the Dewazakura Oka. &#160;Overall, most everything on the menu was delicious, and only the seared scallops were disappointing. &#160;The sushi rice could be tweaked a bit, and I would love to see a true kaiseki course menu - all the dishes and soups are there, so it's a matter of bundling. &#160;The dining room can be a bit noisy but I loved the energy and vibe of the place on a Thursday night. How can I not like Momiji? It's basically Umi's put on cap hill and Umi's is prob my fav sushi joint overall. The decor is nice and we came here for hh on a Sunday. One difference is that Umi's tends to always be packed, Momiji is more calm. But that may change as it's just opened and growing in popularity. Menu wise, basically the same offerings as Umi's, their hh was literally the same.Service wise, they have yet to perfect it, but that's expected as it's new. On another note, it can be a bit hard to find, it's right btwn public storage and eltana. There's no giant name sign, but there is a colorful flower thing above the entrance. Some pretty enjoyable sushi in a new restaurant that hasn't been discovered yet. &#160; Not really authentically Japanese, more an american and inventively frou frou interpretation of it, but quite enjoyable for it. &#160; I found the service to be pleasant, informed, friendly, and un-rushed, particularly for helping me to navigate an extensive saki and shochu drink menu. &#160; Tasty, prepared with care and flair, attention to detail and clean. Great date night spot! &#160;The service was good but the food was better. &#160;Creative sushi and also standby favorites, all executed well. &#160;Who'd of thought a sushi roll featuring banana could be so tasty?! &#160;Wonderful selection of sake too which the waitress seemed to know a thing or two about. &#160;We sat in the back so we got to enjoy the beautiful courtyard. &#160;I'm never sitting in the front of this restaurant. &#160;We didn't have reservations &amp; they seated us within 6 minutes. &#160;I will be back for sure. &#160;It's kind of a once in awhile restaurant because it's not exactly budget friendly, but worth it. &#160;The best sushi restaurant on the hill for sure. Sister restaurant to Umi in Belltown - home of my favorite rolls in Seattle! &#160;We did happy hour in the bar at Momiji - service was friendly, great HH deals, fast service, and no rush to get us out the door when we wanted to stay and chat. &#160; I've very pleased to have Momiji up on Capitol Hill! Bravo, Momiji! Last night's soft opening event was a delight. The gorgeous atrium garden between two dining areas and beautiful handmade tables were a treat. I couldn't stop touching the tables! Also, you'll see familiar faces of great staff from Umi and Kushibar. The bartenders were quick and attentive while making delicious and intriguing drinks. The "Hello Kitty" made me feel like a child again with it's distinct pink hue and sweet candy taste. While the "Hannoki Falls" was cool and refreshing, a perfect match to any sushi roll. Both winners amongst my friends. Momiji's food was also fresh, showed attention to detail, and had similar qualities of dishes you would find at Umi. I am so happy that Momiji is here in Capital Hill. &#160;Yay! &#160;I really like Umi, so am very happy. &#160;Note: The service is kinda slow/discombobulated - so give them a little bit of time to work that out before going back. &#160;I am thinking it's more of a rolls and happy hour place, for me at least. &#160;Really beautiful job with the decor/ambiance.- Love their rolls, always. &#160;Hottie was spicy and delicious. &#160;Also noticed they had my bad boy roll (like from Umi) on the menu. &#160;Yay.- Black cod, meh. &#160;Skip it.- Scallop bake - pretty good.- Seaweed Salad - pretty good.- Island roll - one of the favorites (after the Hottie).The waitress messed up one of our orders and brought us the wrong roll. &#160;She took it back (dunno if she ate it, trashed it, gave it to someone else) - but that was weird. &#160;We waited another 15 minutes for our order to be delivered.Pricey. &#160;If you're pricey, your service better be good (it wasn't). If service improves, I'll go back. &#160;If you have a happy hour menu, I'll go. &#160;If you do late night happy hour, I'll go. &#160;If I'm craving one of those rolls, I'll go. Momiji is yummySo I really liked the layout and the decor. Wood through out and an interesting wood art chandelier in front. I sat in the bar for their happy hour but poked my head into the main restaurant and peeked out back in the garden. What I saw I approved.The Beef short ribs were good, a bit chewy in parts but flavor was good. The sashimi was fresh and delicious. They have a bunch of different combinations, which is very nice to have. I ordered set A. I think you get, salmon, albacore, eel, tuna and another i can't remember.I also tried my friends seattle roll, which was a tempura battered roll, fried &#160;just right.The staff is courteous and friendly with slight hiccups that don't really matter, the food came out quickly, I'll definitely return again.Happy Hour Time: 4pm - 6pm, 11pm-1am Sun-Thurs Just like Umi Sake house only in a new setting: Capitol Hill. Sleek in its design, the sprawling back opens up to a larger circular seating area complete with an gorgeous Japanese garden center stage. Momiji takes the menu a slight step beyond its sister-restaurants. Hot spicy soups. oyster shooters, salmon baked mussels and its plethora of rolls. if your aiming to go the different route, stick within the appetizers.My only criticism is that of its slow service and recivence of food. Our waitress didn't take our orders till a half hour after we were seated and it took another 30+ just to get my one roll!! i understand its busy with opening week but kick up the service at least. They certainly don't slack in cleaning up your table as soon as one's done. Momiji was a great experience. &#160;My favorite things about this place?The decor: The awesome interior surrounds a very zen-like courtyard, the lighting is ambient, there's really cool woven artwork (fish?) made from fabric/papery material on the walls. &#160;It was the perfect setting for the rainy and blustery autumn night.The food: I had some interesting dishes- I enjoyed the evening special, the 009 which had spicy tuna, avocado, cilantro, wrapped in white king salmon, lime, and jalapeno. &#160;I also recommend the hotter-than-hell, although it could stand to be a lot hotter. &#160;The jalapeno hamachi was one of my favorite dishes- much better than Katsuya in LA which used to claim my favorite yellowtail sashimi. &#160;This one has a more superior (delicious) ponzu sauce that made me want to lick the plate, had I not been in a restaurant. &#160;The king salmon sashimi was extremely fresh and tasty. &#160;The other really good dish we had tonight, the ginger chicken, has such a great crunchy outside which melts into a softer inside- all around yummy. &#160;The service: Friendly hostesses greet you at the entrance and our server was sweet and helpful and also didn't blink an eye when my (aversion-to-fish, therefore sushi) brother requested a fork. The hours: Anyone who knows me knows that I grumble a lot about Seattle dining hours. &#160;It's hard to call yourself a big city when most restaurants all but shut down by 10:30-11pm. &#160;If I read the menu correctly, Momiji is open late-night until 2am (kitchen closes at 1), which is a much better late night alternative to the Wendy's drive-through. &#160;My not so favorite things?The price: The only reason why I wouldn't return here on a regular basis for my sushi fix is the price- I'll save it for more special occasions. &#160;I think this would be a great place to come during happy hour just to get &#160;a drink and sample one or two things.The heat (or lack thereof): &#160;It was a little on the cold side the whole time we were there, I suppose we should have spoken up on that so I can't fault them here. &#160;We did order tea to warm ourselves up and it was delish.One other note. &#160;As it's Capitol Hill, parking is always an issue. &#160;We were super lucky to snag street parking and this was a Tuesday night- so plan for extra time for the search on the weekend. This place is hard to find unless you know the area pretty well... the sign is kind of hidden so I drove past it not realizing it was across from the police station.Paul B. got here exactly at 4 p.m. which is when they start happy hour. We were here on a Sunday and because we were the first ones in... it was pretty empty so we had prime choice of seating. We sat right by the Japanese garden, duh! That was pretty much what we wanted to check out too... I really liked it although it did remind me a lot of Umi Sake House. The happy hour menu looked exactly the same and the waiter we had also worked at Umi. I guess that makes sense for them to transition over like that.We ordered the bad boy roll and crunchy Seattle roll... I preferred the crunch roll over the bad boy roll. I realized we had ordered way too much fried stuff but it was cheap so it satisfied me. Everything else on the menu looked really pricy so we didn't try those but I'm curious and would be willing to come back to check those out. But as for the quality of service, happy hour deals and gorgeous restaurant atmosphere, I'd give this place a 4-star rating. very very classy. an upscale spot to spice up the captiol hill area. quietly tucked away on 12th ave (right across the street from the police station and kitty corner to the liquor store) is Momiji. dimly lit looking in from the street and not much more than a faint frosted glass lettering to let you know you've found the place...wood and brick finished interior - classy bar setting in the fore house with a hall way to the restrooms that opens up to a dining area, open sushi bar, courtyard and more dining area beyond that. the floor plan as well as menu is rather reminiscent of Umi Sake House (1st and Bell). It being the same owners it only makes sense!the food is nothing short of spectacular (as i am also a big fan of Umi). the service is great! we were taken care of by Dalton (perhaps my favorite bartender of all time). His witty comments, boyish charm, amazing attention to detail (never needing to ask for anything - he even heard a chopstick drop from across the bar and had another pair ready for the restaurant patron, all the while making ice balls!) Cody was great as well - making sure all our food came out in a timely manner and table cleaned up ready for round after round after round of food.great ambiance - great food - great decor... i'm definitely a fan.short one star of 5 due to it being capitol hill and parking can be rather challenging at any time of the day. also it being across the police station is a good reason not to get wasted haha. and though the food is delicious it can be considered rather pricey as your average dish is about $12-15 with a few reaching into the $20-$30 mark. Great wine, great vibe, great date and AMAZING SUSHI! super yummy! Great for big parties too! I will return as soon as i can! Overall, I can't really call this place a 4 star because how can you when you haven't really tasted their nigiri and sashimi, but it's a solid 3.5 rounded up for the beautiful space, creative and tasty makimono, and fresh veggies.Stumbled upon this place while walking around and looking for a very late lunch / early dinner. &#160;This place fit the bill (it was open at 4:30 and it was sushi) and had a nice happy hour menu. &#160;The decor was very zen -- pretty, airy, light. &#160;The server was very friendly and told us the place was just a week or so new and from the same folks as Umi and Kushi. &#160;Being an out-of-towner, I've never heard of these places but my Seattle native friend seemed impressed. &#160;The on-the-house edamame was a nice touch. &#160;We didn't try any nigiri or sashimi, so I can't really comment on the quality of the fish (with so much stuff going on in the maki, it's hard to tell), sushi rice, or chef's knife/preparation skills. &#160;We got four of the bigger makis that were pretty tasty. &#160;I especially liked the one with a bunch of jalapeno on top. It's Umi 2.0: cozier and sexier with a similar minimalist wood-heavy design, artisan paper lanterns, a beautiful courtyard garden and many familiar favorite rolls (bad boy, street fighter, casino royale, et cetera). &#160;If you've ever eaten at Umi (and what Seattle sushi whore hasn't?), then you know what you're in for. &#160;It's consistently high quality fish, untraditional ingredient mash-ups like tuna-lime-jalapeno, and all beautifully plated. &#160;I am really happy that Capitol Hill finally has one truly good sushi restaurant and that it's located in a relatively relaxed part of the neighborhood. &#160;Service was fantastic, the cocktails were strong, and the bathroom doors are not camouflaged into the walls! &#160;Also, the hamachi sashimi was orgasmic. &#160;Happy hour is similar to Umi's, which means I'll probably eat here every day until I get mercury poisoning. And die happy. This place is the same as Umi, but they just moved everything over to Capitol Hill.The food, decor, happy hour deals, workers, and chefs are all exactly the same. What's the point? This is like a higher class Boom Noodle. The only thing going for this place is the Japanese courtyard located in the center of the restaurant. But then again, even that isn't all that impressive.I wouldn't return unless there were some special event held here. For food, I'd much rather walk elsewhere. The triplet to Umi Sake House and Kushibar, Momiji drew my attention long before opening day due in large part to the rumors (and later photos) of a lovely outdoor courtyard replete with Japanese maples, also called...momiji. Since they're my favorite tree, it's no wonder I felt an affinity from the beginning.Fans of Umi in particular will feel right at home, from the wood-paneled, almost hidden bathrooms tucked off the entry hall to a few familiar menu listings (rolls in particular). But Momiji has a particularly unique twist: the showcase kaiseki menu, a traditional Japanese series of small plates whose content is determined by what's local and in season. If there's a more perfect fusion of Japanese and Northwestern culinary culture, I don't know what it would be....On Wednesday's official opening night, the kaiseki menu was tucked in the front of the regular menu binder, but it wasn't yet clear whether it was available for a set price (along the lines of omakase, which is clearly available at $30, $40, $50, or $100 levels). I wanted to branch out a bit from sushi, so I sampled one kaiseki item (a grilled tuna steak accompanied by sprinkles of yuzu salt), one plate from the specials menu (an assortment of mushrooms sauteed in broth), and eventually one sushi roll (the 007). My man had a big beautifully satisfying bowl of yakiudon with chicken, and nibbles of all else. Verdict? The night's winner was the yakiudon: succulent thick noodles in the sort of earthy yet fresh broth that's the rarest of hearty treats (and with free-range chicken or tofu, of course). At $15, it's a bit pricey...but not much, given how huge it is. Second was the mushroom plate. Cooked just until tender but not until soft, bathed in a salty sauce, simple and satisfying....I could have eaten a bowl and been in heaven. Third was the 007 roll, covered with tiny slivers of jalape&#241;o and topped with delicate, starfish-like slices of lime, not spicy to the bite but building heat on the palate after a few minutes into a low, pleasantly painful burn.That leaves the tuna. Good? Yes. Great? No. Worth $12? Probably not, unless the grill does a better job of keeping it rare. Hopefully that's not an indication of the future of the kaiseki menu and simply a function of the first night wildness, given that several plates did look intriguing and represented a range of dishes I haven't yet encountered. The courtyard really is a lovely touch: it's the physical centerpiece and if you're lucky to sit at one of the tables ringing it, you do feel just a bit transported. I'm looking forward already to warm summer nights where the doors will be flung open and the sounds of the fountain will bubble below the diners' din. And since you have to walk farther back into the restaurant itself to sit, there's a beautiful small bar space up front with big windows to 12th, which provides a sleek city experience that contrasts nicely with the traditional Kyoto courtyard inside.I'm excited to have a space right nearby for great sushi; no longer will I be limited to Belltown, Tangletown or West Seattle to get the fix that meets my standards. And I'm excited to explore the rest of the menu, given that there were about ten other things I would have been excited to order if I had an equal number of stomachs last night. Service was excellent (thank you, Lawrence!), and although some of the cocktails seem far too pricey ($12, really?!), my Aviation gin &amp; tonic was just what I needed after a long day. And before noodles, and mushrooms, and spicily satisfying sushi....Momiji, welcome. Friends? Go. I love ur sushi rolll, hotta than wasabi...the cap hill version of Umi son' and Kushi Kushi.. Space is on a million, crazy design, wood chic interior, zen garden, and pretty spacious... definitely promotes a good time.Drinks - solid cocktails and reasonable amount of beers on draft.. shit I dont drink cocktails, I'm on that Macallen 12 yr... though my chick friends seem to lover their Hello Kitty dranky... so if u need a nice, social, be scene drink spot...this is it.. This place maybe my new watering whole.Food ordered the Mr. Perfect Role (aka Curt Henning) and it was kind of perfect, with a fresh and refresh taste for the pallete. It's spicy tuna topped wit Albacore tuna wit a cucumber balance.. Tuna on Tuna on Tuna...haha... &#160;Rainbow roll is on point, spicy crab with generous cuts of fish on top, and exquisitely presented.... also love the Bad Boy roll bbq ell w/avocado deep fried...I guess Umi said that they wont stop... sidenote... the presentation of the regular rolls are presented like regular rolls..definitely a go to spot...good music too - XX, phatogram, death cab.. Momiji deserves a 4 star for overall experience. From the owners of Umi and Kusshi, Momiji is located in a great spot in Capitol Hill.The decor is modern minimalist, and smells like a cozy sauna from the new wooden walls. There is a Zen garden that makes for a great view if you sit in the restaurant area (as opposed to the bar area). This is a good spot for a couple, a first date, or a small group. The food: a nice variety of sushi, sashimi and cooked dishes. Nothing original that I have not seen before in Seattle establishments similar oto this, but the selection was solid and familiar. I have not had their sashimi selection yet so I cannot comment at this time. The only thing out of balance in the menu is the enormous selection of rolls, ranging from the familiar Tarantula Extreme (also found at Japonessa, started up by some former Umi-ers) to more original rolls. The problem is that there are just too many rolls (it seemed like 40 choices), which makes a diner overwhelmed when looking at the menu. I should mention that the rolls are gigantic is serving size; do share with your friends unless you are very hungry.Cooked dishes such as the Pork Shoulder and grilled Fish were good. Overall I give the food quality a 3.5 stars.The service:From the moment you step in to being seated and finally greeted and taken care of by your waitress/waiter, the experience is rather disappointing. I've been to Momiji now 3 times since their opening 3 weeks go, and each time, the initial greeting with the hostess has always been lukewarm. During the last visit, we were trying to decide whether we wanted to be seated right away or to have a drink at the bar first. The hostess did not want to seat us right away, giving us the impression that the restaurant was full. It turned out that the restaurant had plenty of tables empty, so the hostess' behavior was a mystery to us.Service overall was not very personal and rather inattentive. This is a let-down considering the price point of the place. I had asked for rice with my meat dish but the dish came sans rice, and finally when I was able to flag down the waitress, she admitted having forgotten my rice. I then asked her to reheat my meat dish since it was cold. She then proceeded to take it away and came back not with both the rice and meat dishes warm and ready to eat, but only with the rice...Many moments later, the meat dish returned but as you might have guessed, the rice had become cold. At that point, I gave up and ate my food in disappointed silence.In sum, the service deserves a 2 star, but the overall 4 star is due to the stellar location and inspiring design of this place. Hopefully the service will improve in the future. FINALLY!!!!, a good sushi happy hour on the hill, I don't need to go to bell town anymore. &#160;I should probably keep this to myself, but I will let you have this gem of information. &#160;The space is amazing and smells of fresh wood, with a realistic Japanese Zen garden in the middle. &#160;The staff is extremely nice and I never had to wait for more water or to order more menu items. &#160;The happy hour is identical to Umi in belltown, so it's incredible. &#160;Their fish and rice was perfect. &#160;The Salmon Tartare was incredible, I asked for sockeye salmon in it and there was a little extra charge but worth it. &#160;Their sushi rolls are perfect and I swear they have the best roe in the business. &#160;The hot sake is great...everything was perfect.Salmon Tarter = ExcellentAlbacore Sashimi = Best I have hadSpider Roll = ExcellentSpicy California Roll = GreatSpare RIbs = ExcellentCalamari = not the same as UMI only ok for me.Hot Sake = GreatService = ExcellentSpace = ExcellentHappy hour Sun - Thurs 4pm - 6pm (7pm in the bar), and late night 11 - 1.I will be a regular here.
Oh my God! &#160;There was a period in my life -- 6th grade to maybe 7th grade -- when my friends and I ate at Burger King so often that the cashiers would put our orders in as we walked through the doors. &#160;Granted my tastes have changed a lot since then but still, I liked the triple stackers when they came out about a year ago. &#160;Anyway, I stopped here for lunch after a quick trip to Lowe's down the road and noticed that the menu had expanded to include Angus burgers -- they were pushing the mushroom swiss one. &#160;Since the photos looked good, I went ahead and got the value meal despite the fact that there were at least a dozen people waiting around for their orders (something about a new computer system...). &#160;Maybe it's just me but when I finally bit into my burger I was surprised, in a bad way, at how the angus patty was very consistent in texture -- like a smooth formed patty. &#160;It was reminiscent of the soy protein meat extenders used in the cheap frozen meals I had as a poor college student. &#160;Wait, I have an even more accurate comparison... it was the texture of the Mc Rib patty that Mc Donald's used to have. &#160;The square shape of the patty didn't help matter either. &#160;(Homage to Wendy's?) &#160;Keep in mind, this was supposed to be one of Burger King's premium burgers. &#160;My value meal came to $7.22 with tax. &#160;A small sum for lunch these days but still... why would they make their premium patties taste worse than their standard ones? &#160;At least my fries were hot.
My favorite Cantonese restaurant in Seattle. Cheat sheet: clams with black bean saucesalt and pepper squidchicken and salted fish fried ricepea vines I asked them if the seafood was fresh and they said no. Seriously? You're going to call yourself a seafood restaurant and most, if not all, of your seafood is frozen?I didn't know what to order so I got the satay chicken, which wasn't bad. As everyone else mentions, they have sesame balls at the end which is pretty awesome. I wouldn't come here again since there's probably better restaurants in its proximity. Dear Hing Loon,You are delicious Chinese food at reasonable prices. I like you very much. Every time I see you I always look forward to your pepper beef with yakisoba noodle. You so crazy. I hope we can continue our relationship into the foreseeable future. Me love you long time,Chris I have been here several times and never had a bad meal. The last time I was in we we had chow fun and the tofu and mushroom clay pot. Both were excellent but I think I might have become mildly addicted to the tofu and mushroom clay pot. I've tried it at a couple other places and they just weren't as good. It is such a simple dish but the reconstituted shitake mushrooms in the rich broth give it great umami and contrast nicely with the light flavored fried tofu.Always be sure to read the 'paper menu' which is written on place mats and hung all over the walls of the room. Great place in the International District....good luck on parking though. About the food....VERY TASTY!!! &#160; Get the Beef Chow Fun (dry-style, meaning no sauce). &#160; &#160;Great noodles and yummy beef from a fiery wok. &#160;For some reason, you can taste that. &#160;I don't mean burned or anything...something about that fiery taste I like. &#160;Ok whatever. &#160;We got the clay pot pork belly, fish, and mushroom too.....I thought it was pretty good for the 1st time trying this clay pot thing. &#160;Very satisfied when we left and had some leftovers too. &#160;Price was about $25 for food/ drink/tip.I recommend this place....go check it out! &#160;They take credit/debit too which is a plus. &#160;Happy eating! Food: yummy food tasting like home. &#160;We ordered the Fried dough (you tiao) and fish congee, emian noodles and sesame congee dessert. &#160;All tasted good. Service: good, attentive, no frills, yet courteous.We went there at almost 1am and they were about to finish the night and go home yet they never pushed or anything like that. &#160;Definitely going back. One of my favorite chinese restaurant in Seattle.. Must try! Great little restaurant in Chinatown.
These good ramen restaurants are small so that it gets crowded easily and thus, a line forms outside, making passer-bys think.. "Hey, must be good. &#160;I should try it out!" &#160;Well, that is at least my thinking. &#160;Been here several times already and have lived in Japan for 7 years, so I can say that I do know my ramen. &#160;While nothing can come close to some of the ramen places in Japan, like Kohmen or Jangara, I have to say this place is the closest I've found to a good bowl of ramen outside of Japan. &#160;The best part is that you can throw in a lot of extra toppings (which can be a bit pricey if you're like me with toppings). &#160;I like mine with egg, garlic chips, and best of all, spicy cod roe which adds miles and miles of flavor to their somewhat light broth. &#160;You can even ask for the noodle to be cooked firm, medium, or soft. &#160;Great place to get your ramen fix!!! Amazing noodle spot. Cooked the exact way as I requested. Only downside is the waiting time, it is not a very spacious room so waiting can take a bit but it is well worth the wait. Prices match the menu quite well i feel. A definite place i will be returning too. If your planning on trying a new place or just want some noodles i highly suggest it. My wife and friend frequent this place after hitting the gym, which seems like it would be a great place to hit after burning off a few calories. &#160;I finally came here with them and other friends and saw the place I've heard about so much for myself. &#160;It's pretty small. &#160;I mean SMALL. &#160;They have a modest menu with traditional options on a huge chalkboard that you can't miss on your way in. &#160;I had the tonkotsu ramen and... it was fine. &#160;The noodles were fine. &#160;The other menu items seemed... fine. &#160;I wasn't impressed or blown away, and I didn't hate it either. &#160;It was fine. &#160;I wasn't disappointed, but I expected something else from this place that just wasn't there. &#160;I can't seem to put my finger on what it is, but the soup here s lacking something. I've been on a quest for good ramen in Seattle, and I think I've found it at Samurai Noodle! The broth is tasty, and with pork broth they even give you the option to add extra flavor with more fat in the broth. They give you choices on how firm you want your noodles (extra firm of course) and even let you order more noodles if you're still hungry and have broth left. They were pleasant, the atmosphere was cozy (read: not much space) and the food was great.Come here with your friends... just don't have too big of a group or you won't have a place to sit!!! I guess I'll have to invite everyone over to eat my Ramen!Sorry boys and girls, this place just doesn't compare to the Ramen found in Japan or my own kitchen.Maybe it's because we don't have many Ramen joints in Seattle, but the Ramen broth is a bit bland, but with a kick of salt.The noodles are ok, doesn't taste like it is freshly made or anything. &#160;I do like the option of how you want your noodles cooked.Chicken was tender, and the green onions were fresh.Price is good for what you get though.If someone knows of a better Ramen place, please send me a message! This place is great. &#160;I've never been much of a fan of ramen, but this place has made me one. &#160;I'm also a picky eater, so I only eat the tofu ramen and have them leave out the bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and seaweed (dang, for leaving all of that out, I wish they'd give me a small discount on my ramen--all that's left is the tofu and green onion atop my noodles). &#160;Then I dump a ton of (complimentary) pickled ginger into the bowl.But I'm telling you, this is the best ramen. &#160;Better than Boom Noodle, better than Noodle Ranch. &#160;The line may be long and seating a little too close to your neighbor for comfort, but it really hits the spot on a cold winter day. I would definitely give this place five-stars, but I have tried ramen outside the United States. Comparing it to other restaurants that offer ramen, Samurai Noodle is the best. When I had this soup during the summer, I felt that it was too rich. However, now that it's winter, it was very tasty. The tonkotsu broth is awesome. It's creamy, rich, milky, and robust.I haven't been here since summer, and they now offer miso broth. I definitely have to check it out. So, if you are tired of the Vietnamese and Chinese noodle soups, go to Samurai Ramen and have a wonderful experience. It's a small place with less than 20 seats or so, and you''ll need to place your order first before getting a table.Both their tonkotsu and shoyu broths were delicious. But I liked their tsukemen the best (they also have a hot&amp;spicy version of it, which was also very good, if you can take the heat). The BBQ pork was tender and flavorful (although sometimes it might be a bit thick and dry). It''ll be perfect if they can cut the scallions into finer pieces; they tend to overpower the broth flavor as an add-on to the ramen. I tried this place a couple of times. &#160;I have to admit, the broth and noodles are fabulous but I can't seem to chuck over $10 for a bowl of ramen and still be hungry. &#160;Add extra noodles and other topping for more money but after tip, you are paying $15 for a bowl of ramen. &#160;Even after extra noodles and an egg, I was still hungry.Food is good, price and portions... not so much. &#160;Girls who don't eat too much would love this place. &#160;Expect to wait during busy times since they only have seating for only like a dozen people at a time. I've never been to Japan, but I think this is about as close as we're gonna get in Seattle. Their ramens are delicious, filling and cheap! The broth is rich and hearty. You can have the noodles as soft or firm as you like. You can order extra noodles if you find you have a lot of broth left over. Unfortunatey, due to its popularity, there is quite a queue to get in and get service. Thank's to my main man Sarah for brining us to another wonderful restaurant in the heart of the Chinatown, or.. I mean the International DistrictThis little hole in the wall has it all; Noodles, Broth, Pork, Saki, Tables, Doors, Tables, Flanged-Back Reticulation Systems, Hobson Spigots... everything. &#160;Check It Out.GRR If there was a three and a half star rating, I would probably give it that instead of a full four but I guess I'm being a little generous. Now, this is not to say Samurai Noodle isn't the best ramen in Seattle. It is. But it has been kind of hit or miss for me the past few times I've been there. And as a ramen shop, I feel like I should be able to go back there and receive the same quality each time, especially at a shop that gets ramen pretty close to authentic.Samurai makes the broth for their tonkotsu ramen pretty well - better than I've had anywhere outside of Japan so that's saying a lot. But their noodles can be iffy. I do believe their noodles are purchased from a wholesaler who probably imports from Japan. But, it takes good skill in preparing the noodles, and this is where I've had some variation in my bowls. I like my noodles a little more kata, or on the firm side. One time I went and I received noodles that had been overcooked and that were gummy. Yet another time I went and they were decently firm. I guess it depends on who's the cook. The noodles themselves also seem a little on the thin side, but perhaps this can be remedied by one of their dish upgrades. I do like that you can order kaedama or an extra plate of noodles.Another thing that can fluctuate here is the timing. One time I went, I had to wait 20 minutes for my bowl to come out after I had ordered. Normally, I don't mind waiting for food, but ramen is not really a sit-down, chat, have a long-meal type of affair. It's more of a single, quick, never lift your eyes up from the bowl type of meal (sitting or standing sometimes!). Most of the time though, Samurai is pretty quick. Just expect to wait to get a seat during the peak hours!Next, I like to load my ramen up with toppings that are usually available in jars on your table. Samurai's toppings are good but are missing some things. I like having crushed garlic, chili paste, ramen sauce, and a little bowl to grind my sesame seeds in (or even a grinder would do!) Samurai Noodle doesn't quite provide all of these items, but they do have variations on some of them, which for some people, could be close enough, but for me, leaves me wanting the real thing. Also, they don't put a hard boiled egg in the soup automatically which I thought was standard. But, you can purchase it for a small cost. In general, their bowls are a little pricey I think for what you get, but I guess sometimes you have to pay for the luxury of simply having it available.All that being said, Samurai does make one mean bowl of ramen and I feel fortunate to have it close by. I like the interior as it is very cozy and the kitchen is open so you can see the chefs at work - very typical of a ramen shop.The final verdict, although this is the best ramen in Seattle and possibly outside of Japan, I leave Samurai Noodle still craving the real thing. For me, it's in the details. But, I guess there's a trade-off... BTW I really wish they would open the one on the Ave but at the rate it's been going, I may be back in Japan before that happens :P It's not quite like I (dimly) remember from Japan but it's a decent approximation. The meat is a nice change from what is usually provided with pho. I really like the chili &amp; green onion but for some reason it's quite a bit more expensive than the regular shoyu. They provide chili flakes to spice up your ramen but screw authenticity, what I really want is some sriracha. Am I the only short asian female to miss the gigantic Chinese Gate a block away? &#160;I just noticed it today, after driving/walking/galavanting by it for about the last ten years. Someone told me it just went up. &#160;About 4 years ago! &#160;yeeeeikes!So this noodle place is much much better than boom on the subject of ramen noodles, and I'll gladly pay $10 for my hot and spicy noodle dish with hot green tea. &#160;They're pretty good about getting my medium noodles done up right. &#160;Next time though, I'm probably getting at least one extra helping of extra noodles (girl's gotta eat) and I'm always going with my vegetarian friend, bc if you ask nicely - they'll give YOU the vegetarian's pulled pork that of course they can't eat.Yeah for me! Close to Japan. They have the brown egg like my favorite ramen shop in Japan but with way more pork. YUM This place is yummy. I asked the guy what was good and he pointed me towards the pork ramen. yum. the pork just melts in your mouth. I added some extra garlic to spice up my soup and added some chili flakes for some spicyness.Yum, I'll be backIn the same building the grocery just around the corner. And across from king street station. I work across the street from this place, and it's one of my lunchtime favorites. &#160;A few friends and I usually either eat in at one of their few tables, or just get take-out and eat in the nearby food court (or outside across the street if the weather's nice).My usual order? Tonkatsu (pork broth) ramen, extra rich, with the Samurai Armor (extra pork slices, a hard boiled egg, green onions, bamboo shoots, and some other extra fixings). &#160;Adds up to around $10, which is pricey for sure, but it's a huge meal and coma-inducingly delicious.When my friends asked me why I was excited to go back to Seattle for the summer, I usually told them that, among other things, I wanted my delicious pork broth. &#160;Liquid, greasy, salty happiness in a bowl. &#160;While they were wondering why pork broth ramen was included in the same list as my girlfriend and job, I only stared off into the distance and dreamed of slurping down a steaming bowl of the Tonkatsu ramen.Life-changing ramen, a bit too pricey, almost non-existent waiter service. OK I will throw in my two bits on this joint. The ramon is the real deal and very good. I had the Shou-yu the last time and my buddy and I split a spicy pork and rice bowl ( he had the miso ramon). I left stuffed to the gills. The broth has great flavor and the green onions where very fresh and with a little crunch. I also really liked the flavor of the spicy pork it was just right. The place is very small as has been well stated. Go early or go late if it is lunch time. Get some Samurai YUM!!Oh ya get the MF'in flavored egg...trust me!! :)Soon on the Ave...ya baby... Hey its ramen... and its in Seattle. &#160;Its not as huge or cheap as authentic ramen, but they've got the flavor down. &#160;They should get miso ramen. I'll visit the place again. I haven't tried Ramen in U.S. so far because I was expecting it must be bad compare to Japanese ramen quality but I wasn't disappointed at all. The order style is Japanese because you can choose the firmness of noodle and thickness of broth. I ordered Tonkotsu and extra toppings (Pork, Seaweed, Ajitsuke-tamago...etc) with extra pork fat (Kotteri) and normal firmness of noodle. I liked their broth and pork. However, their noodle is thin but I like a little thicker. I will try to order thicker noodle with super extra pork fat (Cho-kotteri) next time. The place is tiny, so, please eat and leave soon after you finish your ramen. That's really Japanese style in ramen restaurant ;) The ramen here is very very good. &#160;But the price is a bit on the high side for ramen. &#160;Still, it is very good. &#160;Good broth, good ingredients, and I do like that you choose how soft or firm you want your noodles. &#160;It's like ordering steak! Oh, delicious, chewy, perfectly cooked noodles in tasty, tasty broth! Also good with a flavored egg. This was definitely worth the 15 minute walk from work for a hot lunch on a chilly day. It was just the thing to warm things up. Yes, the space is very small, so if you're lucky you'll get a seat just before your food is out. Otherwise it may be worth it to take out.Warning: watch out for the food coma that comes later. So, this was indeed some tasty soup. On a rainy day, it hit the spot perfectly.The biggest problem was the price. The simple ramen, with no add ons, was about $7. That's not too bad for a lunch, but I wish for that price it would come with maybe some bamboo shoots, egg, or more than one slice of pork. I left with some extremely tasty lunch, but felt like I was still overcharged.Still, I find myself conflicted... I will certainly go back, but won't be happy about paying for it. Ramen house, right in Uwajimaya's complex, so its gotta be good, right?So. Wrong.Ramen is like the Japanese version of pho, where broth quality can make or break it. But ramen is more difficult to perfect than pho, because you must also factor in the consistency of chewy noodles and slices of roasted pork. Then comes the "extra mile" condiments, like marinated hard boiled eggs, bamboo shoots, ginger, green onions, etc.Samurai Noodle failed in all categories except for the chewy noodles. The broth was unnecessarily heavy, pork was stiff and flavorless, and they really skimp on condiments. I found myself adding in so much extra ginger and pepper powder just to compensate for the lack of flavor. As a Tokyo native, I have a tendency to avoid any Japanese restaurants include "Samurai" in their names because most of those are usually NOT owned by Japanese people. When a couple of friends of mine recommended this place, I was like "yeah right, whatever. Samurai Noodle doesn't sound authentic at all." I went there last night with my boyfriend. I was totally blown away! I had the Tounyu -the soy broth ramen for vegetarians. The soup, toppings, the noodle, the service, the price -everything was just perfect! And yes, a staff spoke Japanese to me. That's always a big bonus too :) Highly recommended!!4 stars only because they have one ramen option for vegetarians. One of the best places in Seattle to get ramen! Their noodles are freshly made and the broth has great flavor! It's pretty traditional and sticks to what you would expect if you were in Japan.If this is the first time you are going, be sure to stick to the staples such as the pork broth. It's pretty small and can quickly fill up. It is definitely worth the wait though! It should be called Rashomon Noodle. (No, not because the prices rape your wallet, that's sick and you should be ashamed for thinking that) (Because it leaves a knife like feeling in your gut?) (Again, no!)(!!!!)Because, and this may sound strange, but every review of this place is correct.A zen koan to inconsistency this marvel of time and space may stand certain laws of physics on their head or heads or head of a pin. I am chewing through the wormhole.I've eaten here a lot. I often work in the area. Among the constants are the blasting metal music, which I happen to enjoy, (not in my everyday life but as a part of the Samurai part of the experience) and the high prices, which I don't enjoy. (especially difficult to take as the Bush Crime Family has ruined the economy of planet earth) Oh, and the salt.Expected life expectancy of Samurai Noodle if opened in Tokyo: about an hourRanking of Samurai Noodle in hierarchy of Seattle noodle joints: Top 5 I remember many late nights in Guam hitting up Fuji Ichiban for 24-7 Chasu Ramen with a side of Karage and salad for under $10. Where could I find something similar in Seattle. Well time to give Samurai Noodle a shop. Drove up late Saturday after a full day hanging out with my fellow nerds at the nerd fest (PAX 2008). Wow this place is really a hole in the wall. I thought Salumi was small, but there's like only 5 tables in there and I think only one or two that can accommodate 3-4 people. I actually ended up laughing at the party of eight who came in shortly after...good luck with that.Anyway, I order their pork ramen, value sized up or whatever. Basically means extra meat, bamboo shoots, I think some bean sprouts, and green onions. I also ordered a side of the pork teriyaki and rice, since they had no Karage so this would have to do. Oh and some of their green tea. So what did I think?Ramen noodles were very yummy, soup also had lots of flavor, your choice of amount of pork fat in the broth is a nice option. &#160;Chasu slices, and all the extras also yummy-ness. Okay everything was yummy...even the tea.So why only three stars. Well for the price you pay being some hole in the wall with just basic service (take your food, serve yourself). You really expect more bang for your buck here. The basic $7 ramen here comes with just noodles, one slice of meat, and broth. That's pretty cheap if you ask me. For $7 you should probably expect it to come with everything they charge extra for "Armor'ing it up", but that's my only real complaint. In the mean time I'll still pay the extra $3, but it's just hard to say you're getting a great deal when you're paying $10 for a bowl of noodle soup. &#160;I will for sure be back, because yes the ramen is yummy, and the price is still fair. Maybe next time I'll Super Saiyan Shogunize Kamehamehama my Ramen noodles...~Gp.s. I must have lucked out cus when my party of three got there, there was no line and a table for three just waiting for us. I do however with they let us close the damn door. I guess they care more about keeping their cooks cool in the kitchen then their freezing customers. Cheap! Tasty ramen. I tried the tonkatsu broth and it was nice and fatty. The noodles were pretty good. You have the option to add extra noodles for like $1 too if you are still hungry. I agree that it's more of a fast food joint than a place to meet up with your friends. There a few 4 seaters that are reserved for groups over 3, and then a few 2 seater tables. It seems that it gets busy around 7. Been going here for a couple of years, and really love it.I pretty much get the same thing always, spicy chili green onion ramen....sometimes if I want to explode outta my pants, I get a spicy roe rice cup as well. &#160;Mmmm-mmm!True, it's not cheap. &#160;But I have spent just as much ($8+) at other lunch spots in P*Square for a sandwich, drinks, and salad or chips.I love taking newbies there, and then watch their face as Samurai BLOWS THEIR MIND.Hurry up already, and open that second location in the U-District....I'll be outside with baited breath.... 3 times I went in with a craving.. and 3 times I came out satisfied. I've had the Chili Green Onion ramen, the Tetsu Hell Fire, and the Shouyu ramen.. and I was willing to pay the $6.95 to $8.00 for each... especially as they already fill me to bursting. (Let's not ever talk about me getting the Samurai Armour option). What was a little crazier was the $1 to add an egg.. and about $1.50 for soda. (I'm tempted to bring my own hard boiled egg next time... and canned soda.) I've loved all of the ramen that I have tried (even the super-onion laden Chili Green Onion), and I'm willing to go back for more someday. The pork was also Really Tender and added to my Happiness... though I always find it interesting that it's usually pork in chicken broth.Detail to note: Like, everyone has said.. the place is small and seating is limited (especially at High Noon.. 11am is a saner time). If you do happen to go in sometime and notice a free table, don't just go and seat yourselves down to save it for your friends. That's not how they play. You have to buy your food first, compadre. The servers designate the table for you - this is usually signified by their laying out cups of water for you.The place could also use a more... customer-friendly... BGM. Having ramen while listening to The Offspring is one thing (and I actually liked).. but Eurobeat? Game music? Really? I'm nearly addicted to this place. I don't care if I have to wait outside in the cold rain to get a seat because patience will be rewarded with Shoyu-Tonkatsu. Fresh ramen noodles in a bath of rich, lovely, creamy pork-chicken broth, topped with melt-in your mouth pork slices, thinly sliced shiitake mushrooms and fresh green onions. Absolutely divine. I absolutely love this place, and wish I could eat there more often. If only I lived closer and they were open for more hours.Authentic Japanese Ramen with plenty of selections for broths, noodles, meat and vegetable ingredients. If you're really hungry, you can add extra noodles and ingredients as you please. Granted, this place can get a bit spendy for noodle soup when you start adding more ingredients, but I feel it's worth it.It's a really tiny place, so much so that you really don't understand until you go there. Because of this, you're required to order your food at the counter before they'll seat you, if there's even anything available. They only take cash, and you pay when you order. Whether you love ramen or are just interested in trying it, this is the place to go. I LOVE this place! &#160;Their ramen is the best in town. &#160;I really like the fact that they ask you how you'd like your noodles (soft, medium or firm) so they can cook them to the desired texture. &#160;Their tonkotsu broth is so rich and delicious, I cannot help but finish everything in my bowl. &#160;If you like something on the spicy side, give Chili Green Onion or Tetsu Max a try. &#160;The former just has a spicy chicken broth while the latter is a dipping-style ramen.The only thing I don't like about the place is how small it is. &#160;If you get there around lunch time, it would take a while before you can get seated. &#160;I usually try to get there before noon or wait until after 1PM to avoid the crowd. My review of this place is less review and more a piece of advice. &#160;First of all, everything here is delicious. &#160;The pork broth is so hearty and substantial it is a meal in itself. &#160;Then there are the noodles, which are exactly what the over-fed Ramen eater has been seeking all these years--flavorful and tender, but with substance. &#160; I caution you, samurai noodle's dishes fill you up quickly and stick to your bones. &#160;Savor slowly, and be sure to leave some for tomorrow. You won't be sorry. I know having my first real bowl of ramen at Santouka (one of the best) would come back to haunt me. I'm not sure anything else will measure up. The menu at Samurai allows you to customize your bowl but the default ingredients aren't much so it ends up being pricey if you order everything you really want. &#160;You can have the noodles cooked firm or soft, the broth with extra fat, and add all sorts of extra toppings.Their small portion of firm noodles were thin and weren't as firm as I liked. The extra rich tonkotsu broth I asked for was well, extra rich, just an extra layer of fat on the top. I tasted the plain broth which was already rich on its own so no need to "pork up". The thick slices of pork weren't the most tender and definitely not silky like at Santouka. The only other ingredients were scallions and woodear mushrooms. No egg or bamboo shoots, basically everything else is extra. They even have signs saying if you're still hungry, order extra noodles for $1.50, which we actually did, but it didn't necessarily hit the spot, I was just underwhelmed with the small bowl.I hear it's probably one of the better options in town so if you're a ramen fan, check it out if you visit. The ramen broth is very rich and tasty, but a little too salty for me. &#160;Also, it's a very tiny cozy place with little room to sit and usually a huge waiting line. &#160;But aside from that it's definitely quite an experience. LunchSimple place. It's okay. I do love ramen, so I do have a place in my heart for places like this...I really like the flavor of the pork broth. &#160;Yum-o. &#160;It's a hearty thin broth. &#160;I also love the meaty soft chunks of pork you can get! &#160;The seasoned egg is just freakin' delish! &#160;I want to just prepare all of my eggs that way from here on out! &#160;I want to get a dozen and look up the boiling techniques to flavor them so. &#160;I love my semisoft noodles! &#160;The spicy tofu app is pretty tasty, as well.It's true, it's a bit on the pricier end of where it seems to be for what you're getting. &#160;It seems like it should be a buck or so cheaper, which would make me frequent it more, but I'll be in there all the same. &#160;Def very small inside, if you've got a group! Stumbled across this while on vacation and checking out Uwajimaya. &#160;Great noodles and rice dish. &#160;Reminds me of Shoki Ramen House in my hometown of Sacramento. &#160;I think Samurai edges Shoki out, but it takes way longer to get there! I never knew where Samurai Noodle was even though a few people had told me to go try. &#160;It was the day I had to park on the street right bu it that I realized &#160;where it's located. &#160;...so it's in the uwajimaya building but not INSIDE... if you're walk out of the food court area (the burger exit) turn left and walk along the perimeter of the same building, you'd find Samurai.I should preface by saying that I'm not a big fan of tonkotsu ramen - if you are, I think this is THE place for you. &#160;However, I was disappointed that there was not miso ramen on the menu... and honestly, I don't know what got into me to order what I did... the green onion chilli ramen in chicken stock. &#160;Should have ordered the shoyu ramen... my ramen was tasty but it tasted like what I whip up at home for a quick meal... nothing I expect at a ramen place... so I wasn't wow'd by it at all. &#160;I will certainly return to try their shoyu ramen but chances are, if I'm in the mood for ramen, I'll go to Fu Lin - at least they have gyoza... and their miso ramen is yummy :) &#160;So what if they're not Japanese but Taiwanese - if you want, they can break into nihongo too if you like... When I was pregnant, I swear I came to Samurai Noodle every other day during my 2nd trimester. &#160;Why? &#160;Because I could not get enough of their Pork Tonkotsu. &#160;Don't know what this is? &#160;There's only one way to describe it: a huge bowl of porky goodness. I was looking online for "authentic" Japanese Ramen, and the first time I tried the Tonkotsu I was in heaven. &#160;The broth was so creamy, rich and flavorful, I swear I must have swallowed the whole bowl (and burned my mouth at the same time) in 5 minutes. I couldn't believe how tender the pork was, swimming in that delicious broth. &#160;I went there the very next day, around 10:45am to avoid the lunch crowd, and added a boiled egg, and added extra mushrooms. &#160;The egg topped it off.. I think it's marinated in something before it's added to the soup. &#160;Amazing. &#160;Unfortunately, I haven't tried any of the other dishes because I'm absolutely stuck on this one, and can't bear to order anything else once I walk through the door. &#160;Downfall of being a pork-lover. &#160;I love that you can add extra noodles, which is great if you'd like to save some broth and make meal #2 for later. &#160;I, on the other hand, have problems saving anything, as the bowl is usually empty shortly after it's placed at the table. We used to go here pretty much twice a week when my fiance and I had schedules that didn't conflict so much but I went back the other day for the first time in a couple months -- it was probably just the batch we got but the hellfire was super duper thick and not brothy [however it was also actually *spicy* so it was bearable]. That doesn't change my love for Samurai Noodle, I will chalk that up to someone I didn't recognize being in the kitchen.I order the tonkotsu ramen with an extra egg and the second level of porkfat, and my noodles extra firm. Yummy. The boy gets the aforementioned tetsu hellfire dipping ramen. I steal some of his broth to give my and kick: it is an amazing combo, I highly suggest it. I can never finish my noodles, this is one big and filling bowl, but I pretty much slurp up every little bit of porky deliciousness no matter how full I am -- something that tasty does not deserve to be wasted. When their U. District shop *finally* opens I'm sure I'll return to being a twice-a-week diner. Mmm, fat. The place is "cozy". &#160;We were a bit apprehensive about the ramen when we arrived as the restaurant was manned by two teenagers. &#160;I guess I'm under the impression that delicious ramen can only be made by the hands of seasoned (old) ramen masters. &#160;Apparently this was not the case. &#160;The ramen was good- not quite 5 stars, but better than most in the Seattle area. &#160;You can choose to add extras in your ramen. &#160;You may even consider adding extra fat for taste. &#160;We had the Shoyu and Tonkatsu ramen. &#160;I elected to add a little fat in my ramen (you can 3 levels of extra fat to your broth- the final level with the most fat is said to induce a food coma). &#160;I can't say it did very much for taste as my soup was very light to begin with. &#160;The Tonkatsu ramen was very good- even without the fat. &#160;And the pork was delicious! &#160; Overall, very good ramen. &#160;If you know of better, please let me know. Not many ramen house here in Seattle. &#160;A few restaurants does sell ramen but not like this!Service = really small and tightAmbiance = clean, high ceiling helps, but 8 tables not matter what makes you feel like a sardine. &#160;Food = good enough! especially if you crave salt like i doPrice = $Crowd = Lunch business/ shoppers &#160;Dinner, all rangesFavorite = Miso Ramen, extra noodle please!Worst = Always a line, make me feel like i have no patientsMeal for two = 25Final Say = Be strategic with timing in Chinatown as it's not the same as elsewhere. &#160;Good timing is everything! Nobody is watching Patrick G. today. He is sitting at work with absolutely no supervision whatsoever. You can imagine my alarm and the horrible images this conjured in my mind - Bob Fucking Dylan-Throbbing Gristle mash-ups blaring from his place of work, Patrick himself leaping in full grand jettes through a swirling mess of falling *important* documents - in his skivvies, of course. Something had to be done!So I took his crazy ass down to Samurai as I had yet to try and I knew that there would be a good veggie option because the infamous Michael O. condescended to eat here (sorry if you don't &#160;know who the fuck Michael O. is, I would link the Michael O. review, but Edgar deleted it - CURSES TO YOU EDGAR!!!).The place is very busy at lunch, there were no tables available as we placed our order at the counter, but one cleared for us the moment we needed it - because we are the charmed ones. RECOGNIZE!Our stealthy server (super speedy crazy man with a dishtowel do-rag thing going on...yay) got us our chilled tofu with spicy miso green onion topping in a blur of excellent service - the tofu was silky and creamy and gone with a the same quickness that it appeared at our table.Patrick got himself some spicy "dipping" ramen where the broth is on the side. Looked fun, but I don't so much see the point in all the excess dishes. I got pork and tofu spicy green onion ramen with garlic chips on the side - super happy - tons of flavor, big chunks of roasted pork and a stupid amount of green onions, which I love.I'm going back for sure - there are a million little things you can have on the side and I love, love, love to customize my bowl of noodles. It may not be authentic Japan food/experience - but THIS IS SEATTLE. SHI-A-TO-RU! And this places rocks like that.p.s. To Edgar: I joke, I kid. I love you man! .....please don't hurt my precious words.... This place is good, not great, but good enough in Seattle for us to go back. I'd say everything is pretty good, except the meat slices can be more tender and the broth can us MUCH less salt!!! I love the firmness of the noodles but the broth kind of killed it for me... I always need to add water in it.Also, the miso ramen comes with butter - yuk! The right way of doing it &amp; making it creamy is to use the actual fat from the meat, so using butter is cheating! Over all, it is a nice little ramen place and we enjoy it. We can not wait for an authentic Japanese ramen place to open someday where everything is just right! Honestly, the ramen was pretty good. &#160;Tasty broth, succulent pork bits. &#160;The problem is, way over priced. &#160;For about $4 cheaper I can eat a much larger and tastier bowl of ramen down the street at Fu-Lin. &#160;Also, $1.50 for a half cold can of coke, are you friggin kidding me?! &#160;I won't be back anytime soon. &#160;Don't get me wrong, decent food, just way over priced. Before today, when I thought of Ramen noodles, I thought back to my life when I was 18, going to Safeway and walking out with a case of small chicken flavored packages of dried noodles for only a buck. &#160;It was the greatest invention known to man, 2 minutes in the microwave, a tiny flavor packet, and a cup of water and you got dinner. &#160;Genius!That is, until you have it every night for dinner for six months straight, then you begin to learn to hate the stuff, with a passion. &#160;The mere smell of it makes me gag. &#160;Again, that is until today when I visited Samurai Noodle. &#160;It changed my mind and my life.Generous proportions of rich flavorful broth mixed with the Ramen noodles never tasted so fresh and so new to my palette. &#160;Add in slices of tender pork and freshly chopped green onion and you got the recipe for a newly discovered obsession.I'll admit, I'm obsessed, but at $9 a bowl, my obsession won't come with such a &#160;financial lure as it did last time. &#160;I can resist and keep it to a once in a while type obsession. &#160;Glad we cleared that up. Ten bucks for Ramen... right... give me Mike's Noodle House over this shit any day. When I moved to the Seattle area, I asked a Japanese friend at work for recommendations to ramen places. She said that though Samurai Noodle is not great by her standards, it's the best place in this area.But I think it's great! I order the soy/pork broth (I think it's called tonyu-tonkatsu) the first time and have ordered it everytime since. And after I let my boyfriend have a taste, he now always orders it as well. Their pork is also more delicious than most other ramen places I've eaten at. It's not too dry and it's thick. I also like the cold spicy tofu appetizer. I didn't find the additional toppings portion worth the money. The major reason I don't eat here more is that the restaurant is so small. I suggest avoiding peak meal hours and large parties. Parking can also be a pain, but it helps that they validate if you park at the Uwajimaya. I have to be honest- not that I think I'm in danger of seeming like I know a lot of about Ramen- I don't. I use my knowledge of how other things in freeze dried packages are not as good as fresh to say with confidence : the real thing is much better. It was really different- I have a really limited knowledge of Japanese soup bases so I wasn't prepared for their chicken broth. I don't know how to say it any other way. It's like the whole experience has been filtered through a not so good translator. I'll just run through my experience-It was a really cold day and I had the nastiest throat thing coming on. My sister and I rarely get to hang out together so despite our collective throats closing on us -we decided we had to enjoy Uwajimaya that day and what is better for a sore throat than SOUP, huh ?Going in it , I was a bit overwhelmed by how much I needed to know about my bowl of noodles before ordering it. Kind of like a obstinate Sunday School Teacher from Missouri complaining about having to pronounce everything at Starbucks- but I managed to gargle out an order for noodles with chicken broth, nori and chicken. &#160;I got some weird looks from the despondent youths cooking noodles in the back like I ordered ketchup &#160;on top of sardines to be eaten out of the hollowed skull of a virginal young male. &#160;They seemed to have a severe emotional reaction to my not wanting pork in it when the nice lady taking order (she was awesome, very polite and helpful) offered it- they were talking to each other all hushed when I said I didn't want any. I guess it's really popular and maybe I did do the ramen equivalent of ordering it out of the hollowed skull of some &#160;dude.  &#160;She did ask how I wanted my noodles done and I was really happy to know a I got a choice- it had been part of my not ever trying it for going to Uwajimaya for about six years. I got mine &#160;kinda al dente. YUM. Anyway it was speedy and delicious- very soothing for my throat, but she forgot the chicken. The place is very small and if you want to eat it - you have to sit on these milking stools/ torture instruments. &#160;It's all very close quarters too. &#160;Though with weather getting cruddy again- I think I'll go and Maybe I'll be brave enough to try their super spicy specials. It gets three stars for close quarters and weird Ramen technicians being all gawky. &#160;Otherwise I would have voted four- but it's mostly the close quarters. &#160;They also kinda wanted a lot for noodles and broth. IT was &#160;nine dollars each with tax- I think she rung up the chicken but didn't put it in the bowl or something. &#160;their tea is pretty good too. I have been working across the street from Samurai Noodle for 2 and half years. &#160;I finally went in last week and it was tasty warm goodness on a cold day. &#160;There are only a few tables and this place does a lot of take out business. &#160;However, if you don't mind small spaces this place is an authentic International District experience. &#160;If you like Ramen Noodles this is a place to try. &#160;The portion is just ok but for an extra couple of bucks they will give you a refill on ramen noodles. &#160;The broths here are excellent. &#160;Chicken and Pork are the options. &#160;You can also order a dish where they mix the two broths together. &#160;Overall, my favorite dishes here are the super spicy ones. &#160;If you can take the heat, I am sure you won't be dissappointed... I would advise not coming here with a large group because this place is TINY! I came here with my 2 friends and we arrived before two groups of 3 people as well. Although we arrived first, we were seated LAST because we got to the counter and paid last. It was strange to have to go to the counter to order and pay for our food before even being seated. But anyway, we just waited outside for 5 minutes in the cold until a table was open for us. This will probably be the first and last time eating here because I was disappointed with the food. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen because other Yelpers have raved about it. The noodles were REALLY thin! I'm talking chow mien thin. I have never had ramen noodles as thin as they were at Samurai Noodle. The pork broth wasn't very flavorful like I imagined it to be, but I did like the roasted pork in the ramen, it was so soft and flavorful!I know it seems like I'm knocking on this place, but I'm from Hawaii and I've eaten at a ton of ramen places and I'm just basing my experience off my usual ramen experience. Tonkotsu ramen wasn't that good, but the workers/service was good. Good thing I don't care about money, or else I might not eat here. &#160;Super-tasty. &#160;Doesn't give me the same stomach-filling to dollars-spent ratio as say, Claim Jumpers... but nowhere really does, right?Again, let me point out that I am uber-rich, so if I wanted to, I could buy three or four, or ten dozen bowls of ramen to satisfy my hunger. &#160;But I don't come here when I'm hungry - I come here when I want delicious, delicious ramen. &#160;And if I spill any on my face, shirt, arms, or crotch, I usually wipe it up with a twenty from my wallet, and then throw it away.Oh, and don't be scared to order spicy... it's not really that spicy. I first came here when they first started off, and they didn't have that much business. &#160;I was caught off guard by the high prices for ramen, so I decided not to add any extras to my order. &#160;I don't remember what I ordered exactly; I just remembered it had pork. &#160;I've eaten noodles practically every week all of life - at home and at restaurants. &#160;I will pick noodle soup over rice any day. &#160;The noodles I had were chewy, and really good. &#160;I loved the texture and they were much fatter than the ones I've had at Chinese ramen restaurants. &#160;That was a big plus. &#160;My pork on the other hand was very dry, and small. &#160;It came with seaweed and some other things; however it wasn't enough to satisfy me. &#160;The broth was mediocre. &#160;I really wanted to like it, but it failed to meet my expectations.I came back numerous times because my boyfriend loved this place. &#160;The second time I went, I found out that you could substitute the pork for chicken for free. &#160;Considering the dryness of the pork I had the first time, I was happy to do so. &#160;However when I came here with a friend and my boyfriend, and my friend and I wanted to split a bowl of noodles - as in we were just asking for an extra bowl and utensils - they were very rude about it. &#160;It made my friend feel very unwelcome, and they didn't really want to accommodate us. &#160;It seemed to me they only wanted to give seats to people who were paying for an entire meal, which is a legitimate reason for such a small restaurant. &#160;But they didn't need to be so rude about it. &#160;They ended up giving us an extra bowl but no extra utensils. &#160;My friend just wanted a pair of chopsticks, and it took them forever to give them to her. &#160;She had to go up there to ask for it.My most recent visit was about couple weeks ago, after a long hiatus of not coming here. &#160;My noodles this time weren't as great as they were before, and I ordered chicken again, only to find that their pork was tastier and fatter than before (I tried my boyfriend's). &#160;In the end, I just couldn't find myself being in love with this place, as much as I tried. &#160;For their price of their noodles, I rather get a Nabeyaki Udon at Village Sushi which has FAR more things in it, and at much better quality. &#160;Or, be cheap and get a nice bowl of Pho.Pros: Good noodles; moist pork (used to be dry); you can add things to your noodles (seaweed, egg)Cons: Expensive bowl of ramen, lack of consistency in taste, if you don't order additions to your ramen you're not given much in quantity; rude service; cramped room Tonkatsu broth I had last week was really, really salty. &#160;Big disappointment since I hadn't been here in a while. &#160;Watch the salt! bushido: the code of the samurai warrior, by which to live and to die.the seven virtues of bushido ["way of the warrior"] are as follows:1) rectitude [integrity]2) courage3) benevolence4) respect5) honesty6) honor7) loyaltydoes samurai noodle follow its code of conduct? &#160;you bet your sweet, lumpy ass it does.by far the best ramen joint in seattle [after my beloved takohachi left me]. &#160;one of my best friends who recently returned from a 2-year excursion from the mecca of ramen, japan, was pleasantly surprised at the noodles here.1) rectitude: the integrity of my noodles was not compromised!! &#160;firm, medium, or SOFT. &#160;KIIIIYAAAAAHHH!!! i always ask for medium and they're never too mushy or brittle. &#160;2) courage: the selection is pretty okay here. &#160;the green onion chili and tonkatsu ramen are what i had and they both made love to my taste buds, so if you've got the balls to try out something way different than the shitty microwaved, "oriental-flavored" cup o' noodles you're used to, DO IT.3) benevolence: service is quick and responsive. &#160;KIIYYYYAAAAHHHH!!4) respect: the wait staff is always so apologetic when they get really busy and always make sure to come by and ask you if you need extra noodles. &#160;way to go.5) honesty: they now let you choose how fatty your pork slice can be. &#160;that's honestly the best thing ever.6) honor: wait staff did not commit seppuku upon request. &#160;where is the honor in that? :[7) loyalty: samurai noodle, you've made a loyal customer out of me and my friends.one thing i was nitpicky about was the flimsy chopsticks-- they felt like they were going to snap every time i tried to shovel my double-order of noodles into my gaping maw. So far, this is my favorite noodle restaurant in Seattle. &#160;This place isn't for huge groups since seating is very limited. &#160;It's not the ideal place for having a "social" meal where you can have long conversations and stay for an hour or longer. &#160;It's the type of place where you go, you order, you eat, and you leave. &#160;Went here with some friends for lunch and I was very impressed. &#160;I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen, which consists of black mushrooms, green onions, pork broth, pork loin, and noodles. &#160;Everything about this meal was perfect. &#160;I loved the broth and noodles. The broth was not too salty for me and the noodles were not too soft and not too hard, made to order. &#160;The pork loin was cooked very well. &#160;I've been to this place twice now and I'm a fan. &#160;We need a Samurai Noodle in Issaquah... A lot of people hear Ramen and think, "that 10 cent stuff college kids eat." &#160;This is so not that. &#160;Samurai Noodle means business about their ramen dishes.The huge vats of steaming broth in the kitchen, the pre-measured packets of handmade noodles that get hydrated into your soup on order, um, and what they call "armor." &#160;For three dollars, you get the add-on of a number of Japanese vegetables, thick-cut slow-boiled pork and the best part: a "seasoned egg." &#160;What is that, you might be thinking? &#160;Well, it's an egg that seems like it might have been medium-boiled in soy sauce and when dunked/broken into the soup it's also fabulous.And of course, it really wouldn't be a ramen shop if it weren't a hole-in-the-wall. &#160;Get there very early if you actually hope to get yourself one of the prized seats.They advise eating on-the-spot but if you, like me, don't have that luxury, the signage advises that consumption within seven minutes is thought to be acceptable.I want one. &#160;Now. &#160;With armor. I hate that everytime I come here there is a mother f'n line.. but I bite the bullet one day, and came by myself and just ordered my bowl(s) of delicious ramen.. YES THEY CAN MAKE IT ANY WAY YOU WANT IT.. that means I can have my ramen noodles so soft that I don't have to wait for it soften!!! double yes!!! So I got the spicy noodles with the shrimp; deliciousness... I also Got a bowl of the miso broth one which I love so much.. and I think the people there thought I was crazy.. but I just did it to try.. sheesh... Some girls buy shoes, I buy two bowls of ramen to taste.... yes even through our economic downshit I can still eat the way I love.. I just won't have new clothes haahah jk... I have to say, it's embarrassing to live in such a cultured city and have people think Samurai is a good Ramen house.I have eaten there once, and I will never return. &#160;Being born in Hawaii and being Japanese I am very picky when it comes to something so simple and elegant as a bowl of noodles.The Broth: &#160;It lacks depth of flavor, the chicken soup tastes like it's half water, where is the roasted bones, the robust shoyu and root vegetable layers? &#160;Then on top of that they add extra pork fat, which is low quality. &#160;When truly Japanese ramen stands add pork fat the jewels of fat are small, well refined and bring more than just fat to the equation. &#160;At Samurai all I experienced was extra greasy. &#160;I can make better broth at home.The Noodles: people rave over the fact that they allow you to choose your noodle texture, first off, all ramen noodles should be slightly chewy, never soft. &#160;Second the noodles themselves have not enough soda in them, they are flat and lend nothing to the bowl of noodles themselves.The Verdict: Look I'm not saying this is the worse bowl of Ramen I've ever had, but sadly there are some high quality package Ramen from Japan that do as good of a job, certainly better broth. &#160;I'd say if you were starving for noodles it would be enough, but if you are a true noodle connoisseur then Samurai is not the place for you. Decided to stop by here since I wanted to try all of Seattle's top ramen spots. Samurai Noodle was first on my tour. I dropped by here around 2pm so it wasn't crowded at all. Small shop, but cozy I guess. Interesting ordering method. You order first at the register then sit down. I kind of felt like I was ordering a burrito or something.Anyhow, I went with the tonkotsu ramen with extra pork, menma, and noodles. The best and most surprising part was that they have stewed pork instead of chashu. That was a pleasant treat. Good amount of food, but I thought there could have been a little more soup in my bowl. All in all, great ramen spot. A place where I would definitely come back to. Nothing to say here that has not already been said. &#160;Wow- very good. &#160;I like the inexpensive edamame too! &#160;The soy broth was really good. &#160;My boyfriend and I split things pretty frequently and I really really like that here you can get more/extra noodles for what, $1.50-$1.75? if you haven't eaten all the broth! &#160;I'd like to trey more and more vegetable combination's here so I know I will go back. &#160;Their tofu itself was a bit meh- that is the only really tangible reason that its a 4 star and not a 5 star location. &#160;The firm noodles were also a little, meh- the medium is probably my favorite. &#160;Its a small little place that can get pretty crowded pretty fast. &#160;The people working here do an excellent job though of keeping things moving, fast service is always good. &#160;If you have to wait around for a few for a table know it will be worth the wait! First visit this weekend prior to the Sounders FC match (finally, three points!). I had no idea that this place was so small! Luckily, we got there before the crowd. I ordered the #1 Pork Ramen and The Wife had the soy broth ramen. I really enjoyed the flavor of the pork broth and the hunk of pork that came in the bowl was very tender and flavorful. I did add some chili flakes to mine just to bump the heat up. I did feel that the noodles themselves were a bit ho-hum but that broth made up for that. I had a taste of The Wife's dish and was impressed on the subtlety of the broth. It almost had a tea like flavor to me but once again, the noodles were average. Her only disappointment was that the tofu in hers was just dropped in plain rather than getting a quick grill or fry to provide some flavor and texture. Oh, and the sake is cheap, both in cost and in quality. $4.50 for 6 oz. is generous but you get what you pay for. I finally tried this place, after reading a review in one of the major papers. It was packed, so I decided to order mine take out to eat in the Uwajimaya food court area. I'm convinced that the take out containers hold less soup than the bowls used in the restaurant, so I probably won't do that again. I tried the Miso Ramen, which is my reference standard. The broth was great, the noodles were different from what I am used to getting in my ramen. They were straight, round, and kind of thin, while ramen is usually a bit curly, and a little thicker.My beloved Ezogiku of Honolulu and Vancouver have nothing to worry about. But short of a trip to Hawaii or Canada, this will do, but only during a quiet period. This place really needs to expand, and ramen should properly be eaten at a counter, and not at small crowded tables. I definitely want to like this place, but my initial visit was really nothing to write home about. I got the green chili ramen because I felt like something spicy and was kind of disappointed by how UNspicy it was. I'm usually pretty sensitive to levels of hotness in my food, but this didn't really phase me. The broth was way too salty and it definitely felt like something was missing. This ramen is good and possibly the best in Seattle (still no Daikokuya!). &#160;I'm skeptical of the option to adjust the noodles -- Nina N. likes soft, I like extra firm though there's something to be said for specialties and house secrets. &#160; The sesame is optional, on the table, rather than put right in the ramen. &#160;I prefer my sesame directly in the ramen because table-side sesame potentially means powdered sesame or broken pieces that overpower the broth. &#160;The meat was plentiful and the broth rich and fatty but delicate, thin, melt in your mouth meat is ideal. &#160;I'd give it another try for sure, but I won't wait more than about 30 minutes! &#160; + $1 for egg? &#160;Boo! Another restaurant that gets overhyped like crazy. You'd expect this new ramen place right in chinatown to be pretty decent... but then after your meal you feel like you should eat something else. Don't get me wrong though, there are parts of the meal that are good. The ramen is cooked well and they give you lots of little condiments. However, the entire bowl is covered with a layer of pork fat. Normally I'd be inclined to say this is awesome, but it just didn't really work this time.The pork fat covering everything was so much, that it made each consecutive bite, more and more heavy. I didn't feel like I was getting fuller... just, all the fat in my stomache was weighing me down. The pork is nice, but personally I would've preferred some freshly cooked pork, as opposed to some that has been cooked for a while, stuck in a fridge and just reheated in the hot broth. I love good ramen, but I can't quite come to terms with paying so much (all the little extras add up) just for some ramen. If you're looking for a good sized meal like I usually am, you'll end up spending a bit more than you expect to. Overall, I was a little disappointed with this, but I did enjoy parts of the meal. Recommended to try once or twice, but for me it's not worth regular visits. Lord knows this place doesn't really need another review. But! In the interest of enlightening others hoping to try the deliciousness of Samurai Noodle, here are a few suggestions:1. Try odd hours - 2:00 might be a better bet for lunch than 12:00. But no guarantees, especially on the weekends.2. People do generally eat and move pretty quickly through here - even if all the tables are full, you probably won't have to wait that long and the time could be spent deciding what to try and what add-ons to get. If you do have a table, please don't be the jerk taking up a table for two hours.3. This isn't the place for a large group - four is pretty much the max you'll be able to comfortably fit and all sit together.4. The tofu is firm or silken, but unfortunately not dreamy little puffs that soak up the amazing broth. 5. The tonkatsu broth is great, the fishcake is yummy, but they shouldn't be mixed.6. Seriously, order the tonkatsu. This place is getting progressively worse. The first time I had their Chili spicy Ramen thing, it was divine. I swore to myself I would never eat packaged ramen again. I went a second time, I was less please. But I could still remember the taste of the first time around so my hope for the place remained high. The third time I went, I had the Chili ramen and I tried the Soba thing as well. I split with a friend and was less than thrilled this time. The exact level of "less than thrilledness" would be that now I prefer packaged ramen at home over this supposedly "gourmet" ramen. When I can boil water at home and eat ramen for $1 &#160;that tastes better than a $8 ramen at a store, it really is a no brainer.Unless I hear they reverted to their old standards of quality, I definitely won't be coming back here in the near future. I give three stars because it's a mix between 5 stars the first time, 3 stars the second time, and 2 stars the third time. Since there aren't any .5 stars or anything. That's what they get. Samurai Noodle is a really great Ramen Noodle House.They are super focsed on the details. A simple, well thought out experience where they sweat the details and execute well.I had the veggie broth. It comes with perfect tofu, green onions, a big as peice of seeweed ( ate round it ), and some incredible mushrooms. I had the noodles al dente.Yum!Update: I thought I had a veggie broth... They put fish guts in their broth. People, Soylent Green is people! OOOH YUM! &#160;I had a craving for something noodle-y and my friend said he wanted to get some ramen and I'm so glad he wanted to come here. &#160;Since I didn't know what to get, I ordered the same dish as my friend - tonkatsu ramen with extra garlic. &#160;SooOOooOoOo good. &#160;The broth and firm noodles were delicious. &#160; I added a lot of the chili seasoning to it to match my taste buds. &#160;We were lucky that there was seating available when we got there-supposedly there's usually a long line and a 30-minute wait for a seat. &#160;The price for the ramen wasn't bad. &#160;I was definitely full and satisfied afterwards. &#160;The broth was very good-I slurped up a lot of it haha. &#160;I'd say it's better than pho broth (imo).Definitely coming back! It's a small noodle shop with tiny tables and wood stools. Order and pay at the counter, and the cashier will seat you.I tried the regular ramen bowl with pork broth (almost $7), plus "Armor Up" which means the addition of egg, extra pork slices, nori, and bamboo shoots, for $3.50. It's on the pricey side, even though I realize I can't compare it with what I'd get back home.The broth is warm, flavorful and comforting. The noodles (I ordered it al dente) were done just right. The portion size was plenty for me, but there is definitely enough broth for an extra portion of noodles ($1.50) if you have a bigger appetite.It was a nice change from our usual pho or HK style noodle soup. I'd visit again. I tried Samurai Noodle once again after I came back from JapanAs a result, I may have to take a star off.Their soup is unnecessary thick and heavy.I felt my ramen in my stomach even 3hours later.Also, the soup was not hot enough.It can be unfair to compare Samurai Noodle to Ramen restaurants in Japan; however, I still think that they can do better than that. I was super excited to try to this place because I had been meaning to for awhile now. It was OK. Ramen is Ramen! But this place was doing all sorts of stuff to it. I guess I have not mastered the art of Japanese ramen. Once I learn, I may be more appreciative.It's TINY! You need to squeeze in there to place your order. But an extremely popular place anyway. I guess it's tough to find good Japanese ramen in Seattle &amp; this place is rated by far the best from other reviewers. I don't have any other places to base it on- wish I was able to be in Japan and try it there to compare! Since the weather has been so cold, a hot bowl of soup does sound appetizing. I got the pork broth- it was pretty thick &amp; I could taste the buttery fat. Yum. PS: Wasn't too keen on the extra charges for simple add ons. Finally got to eat at Samurai Noodle tonight, after hearing about it from just about everyone ever.There was no crowd when we popped in during the middle of the week in the early afternoon. I was surprised by how tiny it is! It probably only seats about 18 people. But I suppose that only lends to a more authentic atmosphere. It's right around the corner from the entrance to Uwaji's, which means there's ample parking in their parking lot. I should have thought to ask if they validate parking. But if they don't, it's easy to spend $7.50 on treats at Uwaji's after your meal for an hour of validated parking. I had the Tonkotsu, he had the Shoyu-Tonkotsu, and we both had sodas for under $20. Of course, the ramen was delicious. The broth was incredibly flavorful and thick, perfect for a cold day in January. My medium cooked noodles were tender but still chewy. And Oh. My. God. the pork was absolutely amazing. Two thick slices of super tender, falling apart pork.I also thought it was great that for $1.50, you can get a second helping of noodles. Although I was full, it's a perfect option for my giant boyfriend. There isn't another place like this in Seattle...at least that I'm aware of. &#160;Saimin with any toppings you like??! &#160;And it's not all freaking westernized, causing you to spend a small fortune on what you know you could probably just whip up in your kitchen. &#160;In mine, I added a seasoned egg (hard-boiled in teriyaki sauce or something...it was seasoned..soooo well!), garlic flakes, water chestnut...And you can stat with whichever soup base you like. &#160;Want extra noodles? &#160;You've got it! &#160;Really...you need to try this place out. &#160;I don't know why it took me so long, when everybody was recommending it. &#160;Only thing is...you're going to want to make sure you don't miss the early closing hours or the crowds. &#160;It's a small place. Theres something about a Japanese restaurant staffed almost entirely by white college/post collegiate aged men that makes me a little wary of a place that claims to be an authentic ramen place. Maybe Im in the boat that ramen should be made by someone who is Japanese, not a white guy obsessed with Japanese manga. Ramen was good- Id never had ramen that hadnt come in a styrofoam bowl or plastic bag (mmmm, gotta love those food banks), so I have no idea on the "Im going to be an authenticity whore" spectrum. Really salty, though, and slow service- there were two other people there, WTF? And expensive for a tiny assed bowl of noodles. Lots of hype, but it definitely lived up. We came around 1pm for lunch on weekday and though it was busy, we were able to grab a table right away.I got the Shouyu (chicken broth) and my fiance got the infamous Tonkotsu (pork broth). Both came with a hefty slice of pork that was meltingly tender. The chicken broth was lighter than the pork but still had lots of flavor. The pork broth, which I had read about multiple places and was very curious to try, was as advertised -- rich and intensely flavorful.Both were improved by a sprinkling of red pepper flakes for an added kick. I like salty food, but be warned if you don't: I could taste the salt on my tongue all afternoon.The signs advertise getting extra noodles for $1.50, but I had more than I could finish as it was. This is not a delicate soup -- it's the middle linebacker of soups. I will be going back, particularly on one of those blustery mid-winter days when all I want is a hot bowl of broth and noodles. Mmmm.... 3.5 starsFound about this through the rameniac blog so I decided to check it out while I was in Seattle for the weekend. In terms of scores on that blog, it rated higher than many of the places in the Bay Area and was comparable to Daikokuya in LA, so I was pretty excited. I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen (of course!) with the Samurai platter which is a platter of topping including soy sauce egg, chashu, bamboo shoot, and black (pig ear?) mushroom. I also ordered mentaiko as another extra, and they have the red ginger slices you can add as well. So total came out to about 12 dollars after everything. You can also choose the level of "thickness" of Tonkatsu broth, which has three levels, and I ordered 2nd level. And you can choose the firmness of your noodle which is pretty cool. Ok, finally. I would say the broth is definitely nowhere near as good as Daikokuya and the egg doesn't even touch it. I like the soft-boiled where it just ever so slightly running in the inside. The noodle is quite good though, and I really like how you can choose the level of firmness. Another thing is that the pork isn't as good as Daikokuya either, and though some pieces were good (and they give you A LOT), others were tough and dry. Anyway, so it's not the best ramen I've had but I wasn't really expecting it to be either. If I was living in Seattle I'd definitely go back frequently, but probably do less toppings. Portion size was more than adequate and I was stuffed totally at the end. The place is very very small with only around 5-6 tables in the entire place. I don't know if this place gets busy but I went around 7:30 on a Saturday night and didn't have to wait very long at all. 2 stars, only because the broth was ok. My instant chinese noodles were better than here...and that only cost my 35 cents compared to $8 not well spent. After the first few bites you kind of realize...:uhm, maybe not". I'm glad I tried this place but I won't be coming back.The enterage of white waiters who talked about smoking weed and skate boarding should have dropped the hint. This is really the only Ramen shop I know of in Washington so it's the best one. It's a restaurant in the same building as Uwajimaya and it's a small one too. The feeling inside almost feels like the small business of mama-san and papa-san restaurants in japan because of it's small space. It's great, I love it. I used to be stationed in Mcchord AFB down in Tacoma and I'd drive all the way up north just have the same goodness as I used to when I used to live in Japan. It's very close to Japan but no cookie. I lived in japan for 10 years so I can kinda tell. Anyways, if you feel like eating some authentic ramen and not no cup ramen noodle or any other ramen involves dried powder and boiling hard ramen for 2 to 3 minutes, then you'll enjoy this place. Bring a friend or 2 because it's best eating with some close friends to pass along your discovery. Enjoy! Cheap, warm,yummy food - what else do you need? &#160;Last time I had the chile green onion ramen al dente...I'm writing this so I remember next time what to get again! One vegetarian option, but it's a good one. It's a soy broth with what must be a miso sorta base and somehow it seems almost creamy. You get three big hunks of tofu along with the noodles, some bamboo shoots, black mushroom, and green onions. It's small but if you order and tell 'em you're staying you can usually just wait 5-10 minutes and be seated. They'll time it just right, too. I liked this place when they opened, but when I tried recently their soup tastes gamey. Their char shu were fatty. I haven't been there since. I always hit my head to the little condiments shelf above the table!! I wish if the place is bigger. I'll try again soon. Thank god that there is finally a ramen house; after the closing of takohachi I was appalled that a metropolitan city does not have a place for Japanese style noodles. &#160;I think the rating I give is solely on the fact of no competition, the soup was a tad oily and they didn't have miso ramen; but this was overlooked because I appreciate them asking how I like my noodles cooked. &#160;Most of the ramen is served with a salted pork (reminds me off a modified Hawaiian kalua pork) and red ginger, nori, green onions. &#160;I will be back on a cold-winter Seattle day. &#160;They validate for the uwajimaya parking; this is a good thing because chinatown parking sucks! &#160;They are on the 5th avenue side of the uwajimaya building, but you cannot enter through uwajimaya. &#160;Price is decent around 6 bucks but if you add-on the extras this can exceed 10 bucks. &#160;Now if only I can find a place that can make good zaru soba. Service can be flaky, but the stuff sure does taste good. I wasn't impressed at all with Samurai. How do I want my noodles? WTF? Telling the cook how to cook my noodles is never something that would be asked of me in Japan. If I knew how to make my noodles just right, maybe I'd open my own restaurant, because obviously they don't. I was hoping to find something that would at &#160;least satisfy my noodle cravings, but instead it left me disappointed. It's hard to find a good ramen place in the states but this one the better places. The tonkatsu broth is really heavy and rich. May be a little too much. The portions of chashu is very generous. The noodles are closer to that of soba noodles then ramen though. I have no idea what ramen is like in Japan, but I consider myself a major fan of soup, and as soup, this stuff is fantastic! The physical space is not set up for a "dining experience" - hole in the wall lunch spot , order at the counter etc &#160;- but, dang, the pork soup is the silkiest thing i have put in my mouth. The flavor is good, but from the noodles (even ordered firm) to the broth to the pork it's like slurping on satin sheets, and that's what makes me crave it. After going to Japan last year, I've since longed for good Japanese noodles that have the distinctive flavor of Japan. &#160;This sounds easy, but it's not easy to find. &#160; I was grateful to find Samurai Noodle, because it not only feels like a small Japanese noodle shop, but the flavors from the soup, and the additional options, were reminiscent of my best Japan experiences. &#160;It's a good value for a lot of food, and I highly recommend it. &#160;Sometimes the lines are long, and the wait for a table can be more than you want. &#160;They do have to-go available, and you can eat in the Uwajimaya Food Court, but that's not nearly as comfy. i love their tou-nyu, especially with hot sauce and especially on a cold, rainy day. Tried this resto when I first visited Seattle. It was pretty chilly in the morning and a warm soup definitely a good start in the morning. The place is pretty tiny and hidden if you don't know the area, service is okay and they are not stingy with the meat, which is good :) The broth flavor is pretty tasty and they gave choices as to how hard you want your noodles be. Unfortunately you have to pay before you can eat, which I hate, because to add an extra noodles, you have to get up from your seat and pay first before you can get it. This is why it's 4 stars.... but all in all, for you noodle lovers, $1.50 for extra noodle, heck yeah! :) No wonder this place is so busy. Simple food, done right, by efficient, friendly staff. The flavors are clean and authentic. A great lunch joint - maybe the best in China Town. Pretty damn good ramen, I had the shoyo-tonkatsu and the pork was super tender and really delicious. I would go with the "samurai upgrade" or whatever it is called, despite other reviewers, as I think the shoyu egg and other extra fixins are worth it. This is on close to some excellent ramen places I used to go when I lived in Silicon Valley, which is loaded with great asian food. The restaurant is very small, the kitchen is tiny and open with maybe 8 tables scattered around it, so you might have a hard time finding a seat. I got mine to go, but I work across the street so I ate it well before it got cold or soaked up the broth. Overall a great little ramen place which I will be back to, there isn't an equivalent that I have found in the area. Food is delicious here. It's the best ramen I have ever had. The place seats about 18 people max, but the food is worth any wait. omg omg omg [hyperventilating]. &#160;this is what should happen to pork. wow! There is not a whole lot of room in this restaurant so be prepared to wait for a table. However, you will not have to wait very long because the service is quite efficient. &#160;You place your order at the counter and wait outside. &#160;As soon as a table is available, you are summoned indoors and your food appears at the table within minutes. &#160;Downside is that if your party is greater than 4, you will have to sit at separate tables. &#160;I ordered the tonkotsu ramen. &#160; It wasn't the best ramen I've had, but it was good. Had heard great things about this place from people at the office, and it did not disappoint. &#160;It is small, cramped and busy, the last of which is usually a good sign. &#160;I had never had ramen before so take my review with a grain of salt - but what I was served was so flavorful and the ramen noodles so tasty that I see what the fuss is about. &#160;I had the chicken broth with chicken and got the "Full Armour" which meant more chicken, nori, and a hard-boiled egg. &#160;I was not hungry until dinner! &#160;All of that for about $10. &#160;Go early - the line's pretty long at 12:15. Samurai Noodle. What can I say. Except if you have been eating Pho and are ready for a fun and verrry tasty substitute then this is the place to get it. I recommend the shoyu with firm noodles and extra pork. And if your a spicyEater onion green chili with firm noodels extra pork. It is worth the wait/drive/and money. Reccomended to me by an older japanese woman, was very surprised when I walked in. Very small, and loud rock music. This place has good ramen, and pork tonkatsu. Good food, good value. I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet!! &#160;I love the ramen here. &#160;It's flavorful, service is quick (even though it's a bit crowded at lunch), prices are reasonable, and I've never been disappointed. &#160;I always get the pork broth ramen + flavored egg. &#160;Flavored egg sounds funny, but essentially it's a hard boiled egg that's been boiled in flavorful goodness. And yes, the "hell fire ramen" indeed is very extremely hot. &#160;It is not for the faint of heart... i was originally only gonna give this place 2 stars but i couldn't justify giving them less stars than boom noodle. in my opinion, ramen shops should have 3 very important qualities - be delish, be quick, be cheap. in that order. boom noodle failed all 3 but samurai had the first criteria down by far (at least in seattle area), the latter 2 not so much. i was there last week on a thursday, well past the noon rush, and still somehow spent over an hour there. the place is small, i understand that but even after i paid and was finally sat, it still took a long time to get my order of noodles. noodles shouldn't take quite that long to make, the broth is already there and simmering, it's just a matter of putting the ingredients in the bowl and serving, right? i ordered extra noodles and got the samurai armor add on which pushed my bowl of ramen to over $12 (i didn't order a drink) which is pretty darn expensive to me for ramen. *sigh* it's still cheaper than a ticket to tokyo but if the bay area can do it cheaper (and just as tasty if not tastier) then why can't we here? ramen is street food, ya'll. act like ya know! If Uwajimaya is a major draw to the international district, I'd be tempted to add Samurai Noodle as an adjunct attraction. &#160;Maybe its only because I haven't had real, authentic Japanese ramen in many years. &#160;Pho is good, but pho is no ramen. &#160;Ramen was my 600 yen food of choice after a long day trekking around Kyoto or Osaka and I had thought we would be parted as soon as I left Japan, until I could come back and re-embrace this very working class food. &#160;But a friend in Seattle tipped me off to Samurai Noodle. &#160;I was wary at first. &#160;It sounded like an enthusiastic entrepreneur had made a lackluster Asian noodle place and clumsily stuck a samurai on as a marketing point.Not so. &#160;From the very start it feels at least a little bit like a real ramen place, by dint of being about as big as a janitorial closet. &#160;And if you think the dining area is tiny, check out the kitchen. &#160;You've got to be friends with your co-workers in there. &#160;There are a lot of ways to order your ramen. &#160;The two big choices are the katsudon-ramen and the shoyu-ramen. &#160;It seems to be a pretty basic formula of broth, noodles, scattered vegetables and a meat, but you can add further "Samurai armor" which adds things like additional vegetables and an egg. &#160;I mean, it seems pretty customizable, but I was there just to try the staple pork ramen. &#160;Note - apparently, if you order the pork ramen you can request that the broth have extra rendered pork fat to add richness and flavor. &#160;You'll pretend to be grossed out if you're with friends, but you know it sounds good.It's good. &#160;It's very good. &#160;Crammed in a corner, alternating between spoonfuls of rich broth and cold gulps of water I'm in my natural state. &#160;Most important, it is very similar to what I had in Japan - a Japanese madeline. &#160;It also makes a great prelude to shopping at Uwajimaya. &#160;Can't go grocery shopping on an empty stomach right? &#160;Now all I have to do is wait for Samurai Noodle's U-District location to open up. a warning for all the first-timers: samurai only seats 18.this little noodle shop fills up fast. the first thing on the menu is their tonkotsu ramen, a heavenly rich pork fat broth. &#160;it's an absolute work of art. &#160;why 3 stars then? their bowls of ramen only come with ONE slice of (deliciously tender) pork (about 0.5" thick and 2.5" round?). &#160;though the ramen itself is perfectly al dente.unfortunately, the bowls/servings can be easily classified as small-to-medium relative to other noodle shops in the city. &#160;they are no where near as big as the servings you would normally find at the many ramen places in vancouver, let alone japan. &#160;samurai is a fine example of the overwhelming demand of ramen in supply-deficient seattle. &#160;they can get away with one slice of meat, in a moderately small bowl of noodles for $7-8 because there really isn't much competition. &#160;i would come back, but only if i was moderately hungry and happen to be in the area. I had the chicken ramen and it wasn't bad definitely light years better than Top Ramen... but it wasn't great either. &#160;The problem was fact that it took them over 20 minutes to serve us (it's soup! it shouldn't take that long!) and I was still hungry after my $7 bowl of soup. I could have spent an extra $3.50 on meat and an egg but is it too much to ask to get some meat and an egg? Part of my frustration is the knowledge that I could have walked 2 blocks to any of many Pho restaurants and received quick service and a huge and delicious meal for less money. But it's certainly a different experience and has way more variety than Pho. I like Samurai Noodle a lot. I have never been to a noodle restaurant before and I wanted some soup. My boyfriend suggested this place after already going and creating so much hype for it I just had to say, "Yes, lets go!" He doesn't lie when he finds a good place to eat and he was absolutely right. I loved it a lot and have already gone twice. Noodles are just right and I like the tofu there especially as a topping. I don't like the pork so the tofu was just right. Only con is the wait time. If you are not a patient person and are really hungry I suggest to go to Uwajimaya's food court. Also you can have it delivered to you at the food court after you pay if you wish to not wait for seating, but who knows when you'll get your order and if the noodles will be good. Otherwise, I love it! Better than Boom - reminiscent of Japan but broth is not quite there. &#160;Glad they finally have a Miso Ramen.
I'd prolly give it 4 stars if it wasn't for everything else outside of the actual food. &#160;That said, I think the burgers were pretty good. I had a Bacon Cheeseburger which had some really nice slices of bacon (always a good thing, if not the one thing I strive for), and pretty big and tasty.I liked the expanded options on the mention. &#160;Onion rings or sweet potato fries. &#160;Yes sweet potato fries. &#160;Finally someone franchise has done it. &#160;They were good and I'd get them again. &#160;Onion rings were eh, nothing amazing, mainly filler.The service was good, well being that I like talking to everyone, I got into a conversation with the cashier about the area, locations, where we were from, and such and such. &#160;Pays to remember your first language.The atmosphere as some have mentioned, isn't so great. &#160;It looks like a lame fake 50s diner, and not entirely clean looking. &#160;Like someone mentioned it's on a corner of a bus stop at the bottom of the Hill and you'll get to see lots of colorful people and things happening while you're there. &#160;It's not entirely dangerous to be around there at night as it's always busy around there, but it can't be safe either. &#160;You have the local punk transients arguing with the elder ones, and the junkies walking about or just sitting outside the exit. &#160;But that's not to dissuade you from going or anything. &#160;But they were shooting a Tobey Maguire movie I believe further down the street as well as we waited for the bus. &#160;There's plenty of Kidd Valley's to go around (I'm assuming being a fast food chain) so give it a shot either way. &#160;Not the best fast food joint but still a few steps above the national chains abound.I said yes good for kids, but not necessarily that location. &#160;Least not at night. Always great food &amp; even better customer service!
I very much enjoyed stopping at Pamela's for a hearty breakfast during my recent visit to Seattle. &#160;The owners may seem a bit grumpy at first, but after a while you will learn that they are not bad at all. &#160;The portion of the breakfast plates are comparable to the prices. &#160;Although anyone can (for the most part) make eggs, not anyone can make eggs taste this good. &#160;The cook puts out some very tasty omelets, which change daily, that help you start your morning on the right note. &#160;The wheat bread is awesome as well as their blackberry jam. &#160;Do not be surprised when you come in a see just one long table with about five stools. &#160;I found it to be a good way to meet other people. &#160;I would rather eat a good breakfast at this mom-and-pop shop than at the corporate Starbucks across the street. &#160;Go check it out and support Wayne and his family. &#160;Grab yourself a homemade cookie while you are at it. This is a place to splurge in when I'm doing good. Though they offer items when you're watching what you eat, I go in here and go all out. First of all, Mom's Food, the mac and cheese is decadent and worth the calories in every bite. When I'm good with my eats, but want to be bad, this is the dish to turn to. I've recommended this to many and all of them have become followers. In fact, it's so rich it's a great thing to share with someone else when you want a sandwich too. It's very filling and very worth it.My usual dish is the BLT on wheat with avocado spread. While I can't have this all the time, I have this every time I can. &#160;Breakfast is good here too but I rarely have time to drop by.If you can my biggest suggestion is phoning in your order prior to coming in. It gets really busy here, which is understandable. Check in at the register and pick up and you're all good. PS staff has been nothing but helpful and polite. In summary, no complaints! I don't know what people are talking about saying the staff is 'abrasive' or 'rude'. &#160;I've always found the staff to be friendly and I must say, this is an old-timey joint--you're not going to get quick service because this is real food. &#160;That's why I'd rather go here than run over to Starbucks for an egg sandwich. &#160;And the older gentleman that's usually at the register is adorable...do not hate, downtown rat race runners!So like I was saying, I'd rather spend a little bit more for my scrambled eggs on toast ($5) vs. Starbucks egg whatever ($3 or thereabouts) because it tastes like real eggs! &#160;And Pamela's has real bread! &#160;Wooo!I don't usually order a beverage when I go out either, but something about the old timey fridge in the back makes me want a juice really bad. &#160;I feel like a kid again because I want to open the big wooden doors w/the big metal brackets. &#160;Its so cool.And lunch is delish too and I wouldn't say anymore expensive than most downtown joints. &#160;The difference is, it will be REAL good food.Oh, and don't think you can take a group up in there. &#160;The joint is SMALL! &#160;Order ahead for pick up or plan on taking your sweet, sweet time. Dear Pamela's, Your recipe for your Super Veggie Panini and Vegetarian Breakfast Bagel Sandwich should be an award-winning formula!! Spinach, bell pepper, onion, tomatoes, basil, greek peppers, OLIVES, and provolone cheese on toasted bread!! All other vegetarian paninis should hang their heads in shame! SHAME!!!Lastly, I fear that when I go try your chili for lunch today, I may never try to make my own...or maybe I'll be inspired and whip out 21 ingredients of my own!Tip: If charging under $5.00, a 75 cent fee will be added. YUM!!!The panini's, soup of the day (from scratch), and salads have all been delightful. Well worth the slight wait. Sandwiches are comparable to any deli elsewhere. 4 stars for unfortunate dolmades, I should've known better. Pamela's food seems like the diner time machine. Coming from Boston, it was such a pleasure getting a really tasty hot sandwich without the "third generation Italian" attitude. The place looks charming ... and certainly not sterile. May be that's why they have a sign "no photographs please". The staff was relaxed and friendly and I had a nice fresh reuben within minutes. I was quite pleased. This is an unassuming lunch place with decent sandwiches, and a nice little place to relax in for a bit after wandering through downtown Seattle. I added on a HUGE dill pickle (which I think they make on the premises) to my sandwich order, and all in all it was a quite pleasant lunch. Very friendly staff, and a nice non-chain alternative to some of the other stuff downtown. I give this place a 4 solely based on their food. &#160;If it were up to the total experience it would get a 3. &#160;I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the employees can be a little rude, but the guy who takes your money is very nice. &#160;The last time I went there the woman told me "we aren't doing plates right now" so I had to eat my sandwich on paper which was kind of annoying. &#160; I would also agree that it's kind of expensive. &#160;They charge extra for onion-who does that? &#160;On the plus side, their food is great. &#160;I LOVE the tuna sandwich and the BLTA. &#160; All in all, it's worth checking out! Um, all I have to say is really, REALLY?$7.00 for a turkey sandwich I could make at home?Really?Cute only goes so far. The stuff in the deli case looked sorta old and tired, and my rye bread was stale. I hear all the good stuff about the home-cooked food, so maybe that's what you should have here. But if you're seriously thinking that Subway might be better (like myself), you're better off. A pretty great step back in time. Not a whole lot of selections for us vegetarians but good quality food and a really fun atmosphere (lots of collected bits of history mixed in with upcoming art and theatre events). They can run a little slow during the lunch rush, but they're the closest thing to "mom's" food downtown. That is, if you're mom typically makes delicious hot sandwiches.You should try coming in more often. The staff will actually come to know you, remember your preferences and will on occasion chat you up. Though I do agree with others, the first couples times can be a little abrasive. Overall, their food makes up for their downfalls. The first and only time I went to Pamela's, I ordered a veggie sandwich with a tiny bag of chips and paid over $12! The sandwich was minute and very skimpy on the ingredients. I know that the owners are committed to using fresh, local ingredients but the value and quality is just not there to justify the pricing. The atmosphere and decor are enjoyable though.
Let's face it: This place is not pretty. But if you want the best take-out Kung Pao tofu in Seattle, here you go. To-go combination lunches are cheap ($5.50), copious, and yummy. Staff are friendly. Interior: mirrors, smoke, a pool table, and fish tanks.
We could always depend on getting a great pizza at Pronto's!While we lived in Seattle, this was our favorite place to grab a pie for the nights when we didn't want to cook (our under card is Niko's on the corner).I still remember when we ordered our first pizza from Pronto's &#160;It was as the movers were unloading our furniture from the truck. &#160;LOL &#160;No joke!We were coming from Chicago and didn't know what to expect of Seattle pizza. &#160;The pie was the same then as it is now. &#160;It's a thin crust (but not too thin), with a good amount of red sauce and cheese that holds up well, &#160;We've tried other places in Magnolia. &#160;Across the street, Luigi's tries hard, but it never seems to be as good as Pronto's. &#160;Looking at the votes on Yelp, given that yesterday was Election Day, it looks like most people in Magnolia agree.We have tried other things on the menu, and all the food is good. &#160;But, we keep coming back for the pizza. &#160;Enjoy! They should have five stars :) &#160;many many orders from this place and it's always good! &#160;as a matter of fact, I'm sitting here right now with a full gut so I guess my only complaint is that their pizza is too good so I eat too much! I feel my ass getting fatter so now I gotta go take a walk. &#160;Thanks Pronto! &#160;And by the way, the crust tonight was SO GOOOD!! I ordered 2 medium pizzas : one a Hawaiian and the other a Pizza Al Prosciutto. My boyfriend and I liked both. We usually order from Zeeks or Pagliacci's but wanted to try something different and slightly less expensive. Pronto's delivered (figuratively and literally speaking)! &#160;The Pizza Al Prosciutto was served on thin crust with olive oil glaze. It was loaded with yummy toppings and reminded me of a flat bread, but in a round pizza format. The Hawaiian was my favorite and just hit the spot! It came with equal amounts of sauce, cheese (which was gooey and not greasy) and toppings. Comfort food heaven.If you're looking for a culinary breakthrough, there are probably better places for that, but if you're looking for classic yummy pizza, Pronto is it.I've definitely add this place to my speed dial on my cell phone for another weekend/day night. Sure, this pizza is a step up from Domino's or Lil Caesars, but the price is on par with much better pizza places, like Pagliacci. &#160;I mean it: for the same price and time to delivery, with Pagliacci you get far better flavor, higher quality ingredients and much less "fast foody" taste. &#160;NO, I don't work for Pagliacci nor do I own stock in them! &#160;I'm just really disappointed because I thought Pronto would be a lower cost alternative--and it really isn't. &#160;It's a lower quality alternative at more or less the same price. &#160;Of course, Pronto has much more than Pizza; so if you want a broader menu then ok. &#160;But as far as pizza is concerned, all they have on their side are the late hours. love love love the Putanessca
What I love most about Chen's are the green beans. &#160;Honestly, Poppy (the chef) adds a little bit of magic everytime he cooks those beans. &#160;To quote So I Married An Axe Murderer . . . I crave them fortnightly.Whether it's about the really stiff drinks you're poured, the random assortment of regulars, or the sweet (yet crazy) staff, you will always have a story to tell after spending some time in Chen's lounge. Only negative about Chen's is that they are only open until 9:30 p.m. on weeknights and 10:00 on weekends, but we like to say that they close early for our own good. Being Chinese I find that this little family run dive as nice passable place to grab some take out and head home. &#160;It is a little taste of the familiar -- satiable food for when you need a dose for a taste of Chinese food. &#160; For those haters - head to Panda Express for your bland broccoli beef and &#160;leave Chens to the regulars who appreciate it for what it is good old comfort food. I just got delivery from this place. They are always super nice and even though its just a step above food court, its comfort food and their orange beef is to die for. Order their egg rolls too and eat it in with your lover. I need to thank whichever Yelper it was that first steered me to this place. &#160;The food quality is, to be honest, somewhat hit or miss - but some of the dishes here are downright heavenly. &#160;(The Orange Beef comes to mind.... &#160;it is scarily, outrageously good.)Plus, as has been noted below - Chen's is conveniently located right on 15th and actually has a parking lot. &#160;Perfect for spur of the moment takeout.BTW, whoever was trying to compare this place to Panda Express should reevaluate - Chen's is easily in another league....
What a great addition to Magnolia. I expected a take out place but you can sit down and eat really fresh well prepared not greasy Mexican food. The whole family was there tonight when I had a early dinner, including the latest addition to the family. The food was tasty and the selection included many vegetarian options. I loved the salsa and there was Josefina making fresh tortillas at the front counter when I came in with a big smile. This place is going to do well if people will be able to find it. I think they could possibly give Nikos a run for their money with their family oriented warmth and good food. The portion was so large it could easily have fed two people and so I took it home to eat tomorrow. Very fresh ingredients not the usual Mexican fare. They used to run a place in Ballard many moons ago, they should do well. Bring cash their credit card machine and liquor license are at the moment pending. It's in the former Melt Cafe site across from the mid-century store HOUSE.They just opened on Friday! Yum. They serve lunch and dinner and will do a big take out business judging from those dropping by on their first Tuesday. I can say with absolute certainty, the best Mexican restaurant in Seattle is now in Magnolia. &#160;I know, I know, it is a big statement. &#160;However, I have some cred here... I am a Spanish-speaking, 13-years of Arizona living, Mexican Aunt-having, multiple Mexico-visiting white guy who LOATHES Seattle's pathetic Mexican food scene. &#160;I've been to La Carte de Oaxaca (better than most), Jaliscos, Santa Fe Cafe, Flare Taco, the dreaded, and I mean capital "D" DREADED, Senor Moose and dozens of other Mexican food places throughout King County and Washington. &#160;They all pale in comparison to Josefina's. &#160;How could this be you ask? &#160;First, as I walked in, a customer pointed to her dish and nodded profusely in excitement because her over-stuffed mouth was incapable of passing sound waves. &#160;Second, I knew I was in for some good food when Josefina struggled to explain to me in English she was out of tamales because it was her first day... no problemo, bring on the espanol!!! &#160;Third, when I skimmed her menu, the menu was filled with classic and authentic Mexican dishes... tacos el pastor, carnitas, adobada, and the list goes on. &#160;However, what cinched the deal for me is when she grabbed a glob of tortilla dough and pressed my tortillas right in front of me before cooking them. &#160;Tears came full-force to my eyes... "Could it be the last 5 years of scouring Seattle for a great Mexican Food place has come to an end... &#160;AND you are literally 200 feet from my house?!?!?!". &#160;I am now a full believer in destiny.So how was it you ask? &#160;SABROSA, &#160;FRESCA, y AUTHENTICA!!! &#160;That means "really freaking amazing" in Spanish. &#160;The tacos el pastor were just like we get in Mexico. &#160;The red and green salsa were full of flavor with perfectly balanced spiciness... I'll be using the rest tomorrow in my eggs. &#160;The rice was moist and airy and the beans were melt-in-your-mouth perfect. &#160;The guacamole was great too... they let the ingredients speak for themselves instead of trying to mask it with sour cream, and too much garlic. &#160;I am literally, complaint-less in Seattle.To top it all off, they are a wonderfully classy family. &#160;Josefina and her son apologized profusely for not having tamales or carnitas ready due to staying up to 4am the previous two nights so they could open, but promised they would have them tomorrow. &#160;They both thanked us several times for coming in. &#160;The truth is, I must thank them for joining our neighborhood... what a WONDERFUL ADDITION!!!!VIVA JOSEFINA!!!!! Decided to try Josephina's last night with dear friends visiting from out of town. We were blown away! The service was fast and friendly and the food was amazing. My only wish was that the restaurant was larger as it got really hot with the open kitchen going.If you bring a friend, I would suggest sharing a plate as they were huge! They had more authentic options on the menu and even freshly made tortillas. I had the chicken mole and was informed that the mole paste was made by the Grandmother in Puebla, Mexico and she sends it up. As a finale we were &#160;treated with churros and deep fried ice cream. I cannot wait to go back! Please give them a try and support your local mom and pop restaurants!
I really like the ambiance, 1940's Mexican bar mystique with some Spanish style art deco art embedded in the tables. My server, Zack was friendly and attentive. I ha the carne asada taco plate, which at lunch for $18 was over priced, but admittedly fresh and delicious if not outstanding. I wouldn't make a special trip to return, but its a good choice if you're in the area. I hesitate a bit when showing up to a happy hour with 8 or more people (in this case we had 9), but it always ends up being an amazing experience, provided the restaurant is able to hand a group of this size. &#160;El Camino handled us well, and the waiter even laughed when a friend of mine drunkenly tried to pass a plate and literally threw it off of the table. &#160;Not his most glorious moment, but he demanded the waiter allow him to clean it up, and life continued as normal. &#160;The restaurant itself is very comfy and "homely," which I find is so often the case with central and south american themed/cultured establishments, and it didn't seem like we were creating too much trouble for them with our large numbers and larger (drunken) appetites. &#160;The really fun part is that we ordered literally everything on their happy hour menu, as well as several entrees... For those that like short and sweet reviews... GTFO! &#160;Tacos de Carne Asada - First of all, the white corn tortillas were so freakin' delicious, and I would be very surprised if they didn't make them in house. &#160;A good tortilla can really improve a tacos' overall success. &#160;The carne asada was tender and the marinade,salsas, and guacamole were all fresh and perfect. &#160;So freakin' good.Tacos con Pollo en Mole Poblano - Same review as above... the mole sauce was really delicious and wasn't too heavy, as it seems to be at most of the cheaper, family style mexican restaurants. &#160;The pollo was prepared as well as the carne asada, tender and juicy, full of flavor, etc.Tamale del Dia - I didn't get to try it... it was gone before it reached me... I wept for days. &#160;Everyone else assured me it was terrific. &#160;Ok I'm driving myself crazy remembering this meal... so I'll revisit the review later... No mas! I like El Camino. &#160;The employees have been nothing but kind the two times I've been in, and the food was quite enjoyable. &#160;I find that there isn't a lot of variety on the menu, if you were vegetarian and allergic to shellfish there wouldn't be many items you could eat! It's pretty easy to maneuver around in a wheelchair inside EC, I haven't ventured into the restrooms yet (will try them out next visit) to see about accessibility. &#160;The table legs are situated friendly enough to easily pull a chair in without any issues. Cool spotWe cruised in here one night with some friends from out of town. It's a good atmosphere to have some drinks and food, especially out on the porch.I had the carne asada taco's which were very good. I really really enjoyed them! The only issue was I wanted more. 3 tacos for something like $15 -$18. They were good but not a price I wanna pay very often for 3 tacos, and that was not including any sides like rice or beans.The lady had a spicy mole dish that was also very well done. All the food that we had was quite tasty. It's just their prices that make me cringe a little.Great food but they are proud of it. Best Margaritas. Wet, cold, punchy, delicious. Keep craving for more. I've been to El Camino a few times and find myself always wanting to return. I admit, it is mostly for their delicious Margaritas but the food is also quite good. Their mole has a nice kick to it and the plantain chips with guacamole is as addictive as their margaritas. The service is always good, good comes out quickly, and the energy is warm and vibrant. Not only does the El Camino have great food, but their desserts are fabulous! &#160;I rate a restaurant by the quality of its desserts, and El Camino is now in my top 5. &#160;Their chocolate mousse is rich and smooth, and their lemon tart is so juicy it leaves your mouth watering for more! &#160;My friends and I were so impressed we inquired as to where they buy their desserts, and it turns out one of the managers used to have his own bakery, and he still follows his passion and comes in early mornings/late nights to make everything fresh. &#160;The mousse is my favorite, but all are delectable (FYI the flan and tres-leches are still ordered from vendors). When you visit this local gem, make sure you leave room for dessert! This place is great but a little costly. I loved the plantains and guac! The also have ceviche which I am a snob about thanks to my trip to Peru, but they actually have a good dish on the appetizer list! Happy hour is your best bet if you try it and like the ambience and food then take your date here for the real dinner deal because you won't leave without spending a bill. The house margaritas are a hit or miss experience. I've had them extremely tasty and mediocre. The food is typically pretty tasty, although on the salty side and the back room is cozy but good for a group. All in all it's alright. Went here today on a dinner break for the Landmark Forum with a small group. Reminded me a lot of Cactus, but not quite as good.They don't serve chips and salsa, they serve a small portion of spiced peanuts. Those were good, but six people can't munch on a spoonful of peanuts. Which was literally how many we got. I got the enchilada en mole, and I was surprised it came with three (albeit small) enchiladas instead of two. I was thinking, "score!" However, one of my enchiladas had two small pieces of bone that got caught in my mouth (on two separate bites), and I'm pretty picky with meat as it is so I was kind of grossed out. I don't think I've ever had bones in my enchiladas before. I would have complained, but I was like 3 bites from being done so I just powered through the rest, after closely examining the meat though. The food was spicy and I love spicy, but I feel like there could have been a bit more flavor that would have really given it a wow factor.Service was really good, the waiter was nice and accommodating and offered to substitute the veggies for rice and beans on my enchiladas after I was confused the enchiladas didn't come with rice and beans anyway (my mind was clearly stuck in Azteca mode haha). All in all, not too bad. Yum! As a (vegetarian) California native, I have strong feelings about Mexican food - I love it, I want it all the time, it needs to be vegetarian, and there are specific Tex-Mex flavors that must be there. El Camino satisfied everything. The menu initially didn't appear to have much in the way of vegetarian food, but our very friendly &amp; helpful waiter explained how many of the dishes could be modified to be vegetarian (so don't hesitate to ask!). In addition to having delicious food, El Camino is also super cute - there is an outdoor patio, and the inside is dark &amp; romantic with lots of lanterns &amp; lights. We had: - Tostones de Platano Macho con Guacamole: So good! The plantain chips have the perfect thickness &amp; crunchiness to scoop up the well flavored, balanced, fresh guacamole and pico salsa. It's all very fresh, refreshing tasting, &amp; is served quite cutely. I highly recommend this appetizer - it will be the best overpriced guacamole app you've ever had. - Chilaquiles de Chile Verde: Yum! This was modified for me to be vegetarian (subbed sauteed zucchini for the chicken), and was incredibly incredibly good. The tomatillo cream sauce is really what puts this dish over - it was so good I could have gotten a bowl of it &amp; happily eaten it with a spoon. I want that sauce on everything. My only gripe with the dish was the menu described it as containing white corn tortillas (so I'm thinking fresh &amp; soft tortillas) when in fact it was fried chips. In the future when I order this dish (which I most certainly will be) I will ask for less chips because they kinda overpowered the other tasty parts. - Enchiladas en Mole: I didn't eat this dish but I tried the Mole Poblano sauce &amp; thought it was pretty good. I'm not a giant fan of moles in general because they usually taste too sweet or too smokey to me, but I thought this one was really well balanced - spicy, sweet, smokey all at the same time without anything being overpowering. Definitely one of my all-time favorite places. Always start with a bartenders Margarita and a platter of plantains with guacamole &amp; pico. Nothing compares to their Salmon con Tamarino - tons of flavor, rich, satisfying &amp; surprisingly good for you. The only other thing I'll have are the mussels in ancho chile cream sauce- decadent! Be prepared to order seconds on bread because you'll feel guilty lifting up the bowl to get the last drip. If you have room for dessert try the fluffy coconut cake!
Okay, let me say that if it weren't for the fact that I can walk to this place on my way back from the gym - i probably wouldn't eat here. &#160;That said, its convenient, the food isn't half bad, and best of all they have pretty cheap eats. &#160;Now I should be clear, for those who really like good chinese food... this isn't the place for you. &#160;However, if you don't mind Panda Express like cuisine then you'll probably have a decent experience here.One other thing though... for queen anne this place actually has parking so as far as a quick little take out place goes this place works pretty well. There would be one more star except they have stopped delivering to my neighborhood.Their Orange Beef and Orange Chicken are amazing! Spicy and citrusy without being tart and candy-like. Some of THE best Honey Walnut Prawns I've ever had. Their crab ragoons are crunchy and okay but too much wonton wrapping for such delicate cream and crabmeat. Their egg rolls are crisp, inside and out. The pot stickers, both the veggie and pork, are dense and good when way hot and the pot sticker sauce is one of my faves. Some of the dishes are bland, almond chicken comes to mind and any of the sweet-and-sour stuff, but on the whole lots of flavor to be had in the dishes, the Kung Pao is pretty firey here. They use to have this shredded pork dish but it's gone now. Much like my chances of ever getting delivery from here. Damn their eyes!However those in the delivery area should take advantage. The typical reply is 45 minutes, but sometimes we'd have it in 25. Update: I see they no longer have their website, which was up a couple of years ago. The link does point to an asian-themed site, but um...not serving up food. Oops. Not that I need a menu anyway to order from this place, they basically have all the expected dishes.--------This is the best-tasting Chinese food I've found so far in Seattle. Which is surprising, I know, since we have our own Chinatown and everything. Better to get it to go or delivery - because the atmosphere is pretty ghetto and not that comfortable. Also not a great place to have a fight with your parents when they come visit from the east coast. Actually, the fact that it's almost always semi-empty probably was a bonus, so I should count my blessings. Recommended dishes: Kung Pao ChickenShrimp with BroccoliWonton SoupMu Shu anythingSpicy Eggplant (if your stomach can take it)(I realize I'm not exactly going out on a limb here, but I'm a person of habit. I'm still ordering the same food I ordered when I was 10.) Never order delivery from here. I ordered from here, and you need to order at least 15 dollars, which is fine, I figured I'd eat it the next day. I ordered lemon chicken, fried rice, and sizzling seafood soup. I had a sore throat, I burned my tongue with the soup, it was hot, and not that great, I threw most of it out. THe rice was DISGUSTING, so GROSS!! I had a whole thing, and threw it out too. THe chicken was decent, not bad, but not exceptional. All in all, I was not impressed, and if you know any good take out that delivers to belltown please message me because I very much doubt I will order from here again. I'm a funny white woman who has no authority on proper Asian cuisine. That said I have to disagree with the Chen's Village haters. I am a fan of Chen's. Delivery, take out, dine in - I have never had a bad experience. Sure it's not pretty and I'm still shocked that the fish who swims upside down is still alive but dammit, they have great Mongolian Beef. They also make one stiff Jack and Coke. I can't think of another place to get a heaping serving of Mongolian Beef, Rice, Egg roll, and Soup for under $6.00.
My favorite is the spicy pork tacos. Everything else is good, but I'd be happy if that were the only thing on the menu! Went there with the Craving Capitol Hill food tour....it was really good. Tried the spam sliders.... definitely try them when you go there. Love the Kalbi tacos and kimchi fried rice. &#160;Everything tastes just like it did back when I was living in Hawaii, but with a mainland twist. &#160;I have gone there several times and have never been disappointed. &#160;Good prices and good food! Great little tofu tacos! Legit Hawaiian food in Seattle! &#160;Before we planned on going to Hawaii we tried Marination Station, and were inspired to actually go because it was so delish. &#160;We went, and came back wanting to go to our local Hawaiian food locale instead. &#160;This place matches some of the best places we had on our vacation!The spam sliders and kaluha pork sliders were brilliant, with great flavor and texture. &#160;I loved the staff, who were friendly and brought a little island kindness to Seattle. &#160;The location is a little hidden, but worth finding it. &#160;Go on a clear day - the exterior patio and seating was nice, but if it's raining you'll get water on your sliders :( I thought this was really bomb. Never ate at the truck, but no complaints here! The pork sliders are a MUST have, we went back for another order. Excited for this new addition to the hill. Great go to place to pick-up or eat a quick meal, be sure to get there early because the lunch time crowd packs it in! &#160;Really not a lot of places to sit - so i just ordered 2 soft tacos: chicken &amp; pork, both were deciously marinated and the fresh coleslaw and pickled jalapenos were perfect toppings to enhance the flavour. &#160;I also enjoyed the fresh soft taco it was encased in. &#160;Washed it all down with a Hawaiian Sun guava drink - total came to $6. &#160;Not bad, but it left me wanting maybe another taco...... &#160;Next time I will try their sliders and the fried rice, from the reviews, these menu items are also delicious! Everybody loves Marination, right? Well apparently not everybody, but they should. I love the kimchi quesadilla. Grilled and cheesy and crunchy and porky with that delicious sauce squirted on top. Their pork and SPAM sliders are really good too. They live up to the hype. And if you go at 2pm when my lunch is, there's no line! Really flavorful.... Love the crunchy slaw. The service was lightning fast and friendly. The pulled pork was tasty and am looking forward to the spam slider. Great that they have a station now! Now you don't always have to follow the truck around.The downside is that there's not much seating... The kalbi tacos were definitely a hit though. The spam sliders were also flavorful, so I recommend that. It's a really price for the food you're getting. Stop by if you get a chance! It's also close to Yogurtland for some dessert. I've only stopped by a few times and each visit was great. The spam musubi and rice bowls are fantastic with a Big Al. This is the kind of fast food that you want any time of day but would especially do well after hours! Now if only they had late nights and their "patio" expanded further across the courtyard.... Nice and quick. Had the kimchi fried rice with the kalbi beef. Very cute in a chinese takeout box, but I agree with others that it was way too salty! &#160;Maybe it's just the meat? I loved this place when it was mobile. Now that it has gone stationary, the food qualify seemed to have suffered a bit. I had the kalbi taco and the chicken miso taco and both were not as good as I remembered from the truck. The kalbi was too salty and didn't really taste like beef. The chicken miso was missing flavors. What has this place become? Tasty but over priced. I can see this is going to be a problem...Marination Station, you have officially become my Brokeback Mountain (in a good way)... I wish I knew how to quit you.If I knew it weren't going to be in direction violation of the health codes, I think I'd want my ashes spread here.I love marination station. &#160;Love it somethin' bad. 3 1/2 starsThis place is excellent value and the spam sliders were pretty good. &#160;However, I have had better of this type of food elsewhere. &#160;Free parking:) Nothing to rave about.... Went here with my boyfriend and his family (who are from Hawaii) and we ordered a lot because we were so excited to try the food. &#160;Well, we were all a little disappointed. &#160;Our food wasn't 5 star quality. &#160;The Kalua pig tasted like it was from the big tubs you can buy at the Costco in Hawaii (Keoki's Brand), it definitely was not unique. &#160;The mac salad with spam didn't have the same addicting taste as truly good mac salad should. &#160;The Kalbi beef tacos were okay, but a little on the salty side. &#160;We all agreed, the two standout items were the Miso ginger chicken tacos and the pickled jalapenos, they were both very tasty. &#160;Surprisingly, we didn't try any of the Kimchi dishes, but maybe we should have. &#160;Plan on spending an average of $10 per person for one meal with a drink. &#160;I can't say I'll never come back here, but none of the food we ordered is something I would crave and want to rush back for. &#160;However, I do really like the "mix and match" food concept, that way you can try a variety of items in one meal. &#160;We went on a Saturday afternoon and it was really busy -- there definitely was not enough seating to accommodate everyone (even though there's a huge rooftop deck area perfect for lots of tables). &#160;Their credit card machine may have been down, but we were told they accept CASH ONLY. &#160;If you want to grab food to-go and you're in the Cap Hill area, I'd say it's worth it to give Marination Station a try. &#160;Just don't expect to be in and out quickly when it's crowded. I grabbed dinner to-go here one evening and somehow endured the bus ride home with the delicious smells of my Kalbi tacos and kimchi rice bowl driving me mad and ravenous. Absolutely mad!Even when not eaten 100% fresh/piping hot, this stuff is amazing! I was sharing my meal and was pretty sad knowing only one taco was mine. That thing was spicy and tender and perfect and I may have gotten my hand slapped trying to sneak at the other one. The kimchi rice was delectable and disappeared &#160;fairly quickly between my company and I. &#160;I was left licking my fingers and making a mental note of where exactly their truck is located in Belltown (on Tuesdays!) to get myself more of this stuff.Service at the station is great! It was my 1st time EVER with these guys so they gave me suggestions, and mentioned that I really SHOULD get the rice bowl since it was the last one they had left for the evening. Thanks dudes, my stomach so appreciated it!They also sell beer here that you can drink on their patio. Tacos? Beer? Good times in my book. Marination Station is The SH-T!! We always order a lot of sliders &amp; tacos for the studio...and today we placed the order at the beginning of their lunch rush...not only on a friday, but the super busy friday before Labor Day weekend. The order of 80 not only was ready earlier than expected, but the exceedingly cool and friendly team offered to drive me back to work! I'm aware that this was an exceptional gesture, and one that the team probably can't offer too often. However, it's an awesome demonstration of Marination Station's phenomenal and 'real' customer service. Great food. Great neighbors. Support local businesses like this! Pros - Great food for the $$. &#160;I think it's $2.50 or $2 for a taco or slider. &#160;$5 - $6 for the fried rice and other stuff. &#160;Tasty &amp; very fast. Fun drinks too. Flavors are good.... but the Kalua pork wasn't smokey...Cons - very little seating, and I could probably eat 3-4 tacos/sliders. Bottom Line - I only come here for the sliders (aloha and spam). I'm not a fan of the marinaded meats (they're too salty for me, and the beef too tough) or the kimchi fried rice (also too salty for me). Many people love their tacos and rice bowls though, so keep that in mind!Spicy Pork Tacos - The spicy pork is a little light on the spicy side, but at the same time they're a bit salty. I love the corn tortillas they come with; however, I couldn't get over the saltiness!Beef Bulgogi Tacos - The beef that they're using doesn't seem to be short ribs, which is the typical cut of meat. &#160;Either they're not short ribs, or they are cooking them wrong because the beef is too tough. I'd be willing to bet they're not short ribs.... they'd be so much better if they used the right cut of meat! &#160;The marinade, again, is too salty. Bulgogi is supposed to be slightly sweet, which these aren't.Kimchi Fried Rice w/ Fried Egg - The kimchi fried rice has the right flavour; however, way too salty! &#160;Next time I order this, I am going to request for it to be half kimchi fried rice and the other half just plain white rice. Marinaded Tofu - This is on the menu as a taco option, but you can get it on top of rice or without the corn tortilla. The tofu is marinaded great. &#160;And it's the only thing that I think isn't too salty! &#160;Next time I'll ask for a white rice bowl with this tofu!Spam Sliders - This is my favourite item on the menu. &#160;I like the cole slaw that comes with it, and the aioli is pretty good, too. The spam goes really well with the Hawaiian sweet roll. Only thing I'd change is to have less aioli.Aloha Sliders - The pork is really good with the hawaiian sweet roll and coleslaw. I couldn't decide whether I liked these more or the spam ones. &#160;The thing that will keep me coming back is that it's convenient and cheap! The staff are also all very nice (= Don't forget if you use a credit card to pay, let them know how much for tip before they run the card. I'm a five star fan of the food truck - but this place is even better. It's stationary!You can get your kalbi or sexy tofu tacos here along with $2 Primo beers on Sunday! That can't be beat. Plus, there's free (30 minute) parking in its QFC complex. Stopped in twice while in Seattle.Food- 4 StarsGreat tacos- just a great combo of flavors coming together well.Good slider not great, pork was OK, as a BBQ snob I was happy but not blown away or anything.Fried rice and quesadilla were both very very good.Atmosphere- 3 Stars In a kinda strip mall, very little indoor seating. Some outdoor seating which is nice.Value- 5 StarsA lot of food for the $$ Do any of you ever make tacos in the comfort of your own home and take that first bite and say "Wow, this is so fresh, well-prepared and horribly disappointing"? &#160;I don't know what it is that they do so amazingly/secretively, but finding the stand/restaurant that makes crackrocktacos with flare and precision is just an absolute necessity for leading a successful and balanced lifestyle (the previous statement isn't true). &#160;I ate 6 spicy pork tacos. &#160;6. &#160;I ate them in about three minutes, too, because I'm an enormous pig with little to no self control around delicious tacos. &#160;The spicy pork itself was amazing. &#160;I will spend months trying to duplicate it and fail. &#160;Everything that goes in to these little pockets of flavor is fresh and delicious, and the tortillas... sigh. &#160;Maybe I just do it wrong, but I can never make a tortilla come out like that. &#160;I am fail. &#160;All my taco love are belong to marination station. The food is tastaaay. I'm so glad they opened up... and right by my job!!!I will definitely drop in more often during my lunch breaks! Wandering about Capitol Hill trying to get some documents notarized, I ran across this place. The moment I saw the name of the place the curious bells in my head and must try alarms on my taste beds went on full blast. For the anticipation that the name built up, I am happy to say that I did not leave disappointed with the food, the place and the people. The experience with the Marination station left me with the certainty that I wanted to come back for my next Capitol Hill quick bite escapade.I went to the place on Thursday night around 7:30 and the place was packed with the patio and lobby full and there also being 3 guys in front of me waiting to place their orders. The place is small and in total would have sating for 25 people. The place had already ran out of fried rice so that got pushed to my list of things to try the next time I am there. So I ended up ordering a couple of tacos - One chicken and the other beef. They were also out of the pork tacos so again I got the feeling man this place must be popular!It was pleasant to be able to wait in the open area of the restaurant enjoying the weather outside, and after around 10 mins my name was called to come and collect my tacos. The first bite into my order I was greeted by the freshness and juiciness of the tacos. The tacos were not the usual Mexican fare and they had this special sauce that made the meat even more succulent. And on top of the meat the crispness of the lettuce/cabbage added to the freshness quotient and also to my happiness to the perceived healthy value. I also liked that they served me with a slice of lemon to make the tacos tangy and and a some jalapeno pepper slices to make it spicy. Shake some hot sauce into the mix and lo one has some darn good tacos.And the best part of all of it was that I came out of the place paying just 5 bucks including the tip. So for being light on my wallet the place gets even more kudos. The only warning would be that if you are looking for a long list of options then this place would not leave with loads of options. Think of it as stationary brick and mortar food truck to go in with the right expectations. Overall a neat little place to get introduced too, which will get you hooked and wanting to come back. I frequent Marination Station when I'm craving something quick and delicious. &#160;Two spicy port tacos for about five dollars! &#160;They are amazing! A few months ago I decided to try catering from Marination Mobile for our monthly office lunch. I e-mailed and told them how many people we have in the office (about 24), my budget, and that we have some big eaters around here. Roz gave me a great suggested menu, and then worked with me to tweak it till it was perfect. They weren't able to bring the truck to our location, but we scheduled a time to pick it up and they had it hot and ready the second we were there - they even helped us carry and load it into our car! The smell on the drive back was... well I'll just say my office is lucky they got any because I was about to drive straight home :). Once I did get to the office and opened up everything, I was amazed at how much food there was! It was all perfectly fresh and delectable, there was a huge amount of kimchi fried rice, and the tacos and sliders could not have possibly been better. My office even told me they don't think I can top that lunch. Eek! yummers. Very happy to have this place in the hood for a quick bite. The staff is SUPER friendly and attentive. I really love their tofu tacos. I'm not a vegetarian by any means, but that tofu is just great- I wish I knew what they marinated it in. It's ok, they can keep making them for me :) The texture of the tofu also complements the crunchy slaw. I've also had their meat offerings on tacos- all great, but tofu is my fave.I also really like their kimchi rice, but it's a little too much rice and not enough meat, but all in all, has a nice heat to it, and I'm a sucker for anything with a runny egg on top. there isn't much space to sit, but you can always take your sexy tofu tacos to cal anderson (if it's not raining, of course ;) ) This time my eyes were hungrier then my stomach and I almost ate myself to a food coma. I ordered 3 tofu tacos and kim chi fried rice and after finishing the 3 tacos and my wifes remaining kalbi beef taco, I started slowing down with the fried rice which I wasn't able to finish but sooo amazingly good Went here a few weeks ago. I like being able to head to a location instead of tracking down the truck. ; ) The Taco's and the Sliders were awesome. The flavor was amazing! I will be back for more!Quesadillas were ok...nothing too special. I live on the hill. &#160;Back when the truck never made a pit stop on the hill, i would seek out the truck and load up on some yummy tasty taco-korean infused goodness.For some reason, the bricks seems to have lost the quality and tastiness that existed within the confines of the truck. &#160;The slaw that tops everything kind of makes everything tastes the same. &#160;Not that it's a bad taste, it's just that when i order different menu items, i expect them to have an individual standout flavor. &#160;Also, the prices have been creeping up and...the portions are inversely shrinking (you should have seen how tiny my slider was!). &#160;lol.Anyways, i'll go here in a pinch, but there's something missing from this place that i can't quite pinpoint. &#160;i'm really sad to say it's no longer a place that i crave to go to. It's really not that good. &#160;Has anybody even tried kimchee fried rice or Kalua pork other then here to compare? &#160;Cuz if you had, you would know its pretty bad here.Hey I'm from Hawaii and I want to support, but this is the kinda shyt I make at home when im feeling lazy, &#160;"Its whack and Im not coming back!"If you want good tacos, the place downstairs Guayama is pretty good Mexican and I was really happy there. &#160;If you want to pay 1/2 that price for about 1/4 quantity and 1/4 the quality then you can go here. I was skeptical of the Hawaiian/Asian Fusion cuisine of this place, but my dad said this place was really awesome, so I took his word on it. Besides, he was buying. I ordered 3 Kalbi Beef taco's and a Kalua Pork slider. They were phenomenal. I honestly couldn't believe how good the tacos were. The slider was really good too, but the tacos were wayyy better. My dad claims the tacos I got aren't even the best ones, and that the Miso Ginger Chicken ones that he got were the best. They also have a SPAM slider, which I would NEVER consider trying, but after an amazing first impression, I just might have to. This may just be my shortest review ever but their Sexy Tofu Tacos are exactly that = sexy. A delicious and filling $6 lunch? Yes Seattle, it is possible. It's 2.25 for a taco, jeez. Eating Spam and scrambled eggs or a Spam sandwich was a weekly event in my childhood home. My mom grew up on Spam and has never stopped thus passing on the tradition with her kids. So seeing a restaurant serving a Spam slider just warms my heart and the main reason why I followed my friend to try this place. All their food is fresh, clean, and delicious. I had the Spicey Pork taco, Kalua Pork slider, and the Spam slider. All were great but the Spam slider stole the show. Crisp slaw, warm sweet roll, delicious Spam. It was awesome. The lady that took my order was nice and even though the restuarant is just one small room and we had to stand around and wait for someone to get up to sit inside, it was drizzling out at the time, I didn't mind. The food makes up for any misgivings. and will gladly come back. If you were ever raised on Spam as a child come on in. Home is waiting. Purely delicious! Enjoyed Spam sliders with Siracha, kalbi tacos, spicy pork tacos, and kalua pork quesadilla all washed down with a cold Tiger beer. So tasty! I just wish they were serving Spam musabi this time. Just another reason to go back. Pork Sliders &amp; Kimchi Rice YUM!Down the street from my office--but actually checked this place out over the weekend and was impressed. &#160;I'll definitely go back to try the taco's. &#160;Prices are very cheap--but if you plan to pay with a card-- remember there is a $10 minimum which will be hard to reach if you are eating for one. When I heard that Marination was opening a brick &amp; mortar location right in my neighborhood I was excited. &#160;So, a couple of weeks ago I finally checked them out but left a little disappointed. &#160; First of all the service is great. &#160;The server at the counter was very courteous and friendly. &#160;I thought it was cool how they can take your order on a smartphone looking device.My husband and I decided to share some food on this visit. &#160;We ordered the kimchee fried rice with kalbi, spam sliders and the quesadilla. &#160;After about a 10 minute wait we got our food. &#160;It was quite busy on a friday afternoon around 2pm. &#160;We sat outside of the restaurant on some folded chairs and ate our food.Overall I thought the flavor combinations were good but thought the spam sliders and kimchee fried rice were too salty. &#160;The quesadilla was not too salty, though. &#160;So, if you order the sliders or fried rice, be aware of this and have lots of water ready when you eat. &#160;Too bad you can't get the spam sliders with low sodium spam because they would be so good. &#160;=)I am so bummed because I really wanted to like their food. I had been to the mobile Marination once so was delighted when I heard that there was a stationary one right in my hood! &#160;Who doesn't like spam? &#160;We were trying to squeeze in a movie before my guy had to hop on a plane that same day - so we decided to hit Marination. &#160;BTW - I'm Korean.We tried everything! Kimchi fried rice = looked good, but the rice was all wrong. &#160;It tasted... horrible. &#160;Hard rice, not soft Korean rice. &#160;The only good thing was the egg. &#160;But the egg wasn't even right - it had a hard cooked yolk. &#160;????? &#160;Just utterly disappointing for me. &#160;It wasn't Kimchi fried rice in my book. &#160;No way in hell. &#160;Maybe it was an anomaly. &#160;Beef kalbi tacos were okay - edible. &#160;We had the spam sliders - probably my favorite out of the order. &#160;I'd go back for the sliders probably. &#160;Not so much for the other stuff... &#160;Kills me that people think this is Korean food. &#160;IT'S NOT!Good location. &#160;Cool concept. Finally tried Marination Station several months after they opened. Coming here is much easier than looking up the food truck schedule and tracking it down.The space is located at Harvard Market (Broadway &amp; Pike), but you can not see it from the street as it is located on the 2nd floor. Closest staircase is the one next to the QFC. There is also an escalator. It is next to a Chinese takeout place and across the way from a Bartell Drugs. While the location may be a small challenge to find, the good thing about the location is that there is free parking here. So no trouble with looking for an open street space!The interior is a bit like the Chinese takeout place next door as it a bit smallish, except there is a small area of bar table seating inside as well as just right outside. Also noticed some basic chairs right outside as well available for seating if those areas are full. Though given the location's relative lack of ambiance, it seemed like many customers were taking their orders to go. Perhaps headed for Cal Anderson Park, their nearby apartment in the area or back to their car maybe?The menu at the Station is essentially the same as the food truck. Though there might be a handful of special items on occasion that they offer like spam musubi. Thus, expect to find your tacos, quesadillas, sliders and kimchi fried rice fix from their main menu here.I decided to get their miso ginger chicken kimchi fried rice ($7) and kalua pork slider ($2.25). I enjoyed the fried rice I had last time that I was at the truck, so I did not want to test my luck too much. And it proved to be a good choice at the Station. The fried rice is flavorful and complex. Although the tacos here get most of the recognition, I have to say the reason I like Marination as much as I do is because the fried rice is so good. It is the ONLY fried rice dish that I ever order out.As for the kalua pork slider, I thought it was alright. It did not strike me as a standout dish. Then again, these are kind of hard to rate because you only have a couple bites to rate yea or nay. With sliders, I tend to get lost in the bun. If there was a suggestion I had for this, it would be that they would offer a full size sandwich or slightly larger version of their sliders.Overall I am liking Marination Station. No longer do I have to try and track down the truck. I can just go here and feed my need for kimchi fried rice. Oh wow. &#160;My buddy mumbled quietly to himself "yes, yes, yes" as we were finishing lunch. &#160;This should give you an indication of how amazing the food is.We tried most everything - the kimchi fried rice (with spicy pork), two flavors of the tacos (beef and chicken), and both sliders. We even put in a second order for spam musubi. &#160;All for around $20. Who can beat good food for cheap prices?You MUST MUST MUST check this out. &#160;You'll become addicted, as I now am. &#160;I wish it were closer so I can go everyday. It's that good. Delicious and cheap: try anything on the menu. &#160;Not a ton of seating, so don't plan to sit. The service is excellent and the flavors are very, very good. I tried the beef taco, the chicken taco, and the aloha slider. The bread to filling ratio was a little off on the slider, but it was still very good. Next time I'll try the fried rice, which looked like a little box of heaven. Starting on Monday, July 18 there is a $10 minimum on credit cards (according to a sign on their counter), so for all of you single eaters out there, bring cash. I've eaten from the Mobile before I ate at the Station so I knew what I was about to get into. I was about to get into some deliciousness -- oh and they serve beer. *OMG cries* Instead of having to track down the truck all over town, I can have my Marination on any time I want. I almost always get at least a kimchi fried rice and a spam musubi and something else that strikes my fancy at the moment. It's a lot of carbs but it's dericious.The place is super tiny inside. There's a little bit of outdoor seating. There's plenty of pavement so I'm not sure why the building management doesn't just put in some tables (not a fault of Marination Station -- I'm sure they're limited to their space). But it totally gives it the truck/mobile/quick stop feel. It's right on top of QFC and I totally missed it the first time. Literally on top of the entrance. I'm thinking more like 3.5 stars, it was solid overall but I might not actively seek it out. I will also preface this by admitting I'm not super familiar with either Hawaiian or Korean food.Sampled the fried rice, a sexy tofu taco, and the kimchi quesdilla. The fried rice was tasty but a tad dry, the taco was pretty forgettable, and the quesadilla was moderately delicious (but really, quesadillas don't really have to try that hard as they are inherently delicious, also it got fairly soggy).Maybe if there is a next time here I will give the Spam-based options a go but I'm really not convinced that meat from a can deserves a role in my eating repertoire. If you thought Marination Mobile was good, try Marination Station---it doesn't move and it's open Monday-Sunday from 11-8! :-)First off, the location is in the QFC upper-parking lot on Capitol Hill (between Pike and Union). &#160;It's not obviously located, but if you walk towards the elevators, you'll start smelling the amazing spam and beef. &#160;I searched and searched until I could smell the goodness. &#160;Honestly, I cannot choose an absolute favorite menu item. &#160;Everything is SO flavorful, delicious and unique and after you're done eating, you'll be planning your next visit. &#160;BUT, I would suggest ordering the Kimchi Fried Rice (filling, spicy and you can't go wrong with an egg on top), spam slider (juicy, salty spam with a zingy slaw) and at least one of their tacos. &#160;I've had all of them (tofu, spicy pork, kalbi or ginger chicken) and the kalbi is probably my favorite. &#160;Along with a Hawaiian Sun and you've got yourself a meal! Glad another one of Seattle's roaming food carts has found a permanent home! &#160;Its located conveniently on top of the QFC on Broadway and Union. &#160;Score for having a parking lot (free for 30 minutes) when I'm too lazy to walk the half mile to get here. &#160;Stuff I got:Spam Slider: &#160;you had me at SPAM....such a sucker for anthing with spam. &#160;Its &#160;$2.25 but its worth it. &#160;I like the tasty sauce that tops it.I also like the Kalbi taco and the spicy pork taco. &#160;Total damage was about $6.25 which wasn't a bad pre-dinner snack. &#160;Hours are better than the truck, open from 11am to 8pm. &#160;Wish they were open later! I don't really get Twitter. As a professional web developer, I'm kind of ashamed of this, but I've never seen the point. I see the point of long-form blogging, and I'm all for pithy commentary, but I just don't understand sending SMS-length messages to the masses. I barely send more than a couple of text messages a month to my own wife, and I like her a lot more than I like the masses.So I'm actually pretty pleased that I no longer have to "follow" Marination Mobile on Twitter to figure out where to get my tofu kimchi fried rice on.The only things wrong with this place is that they don't have enough seats, and they don't stay open late enough to provide you with a credible alternative to the after-hours hot dog cart. Fortunately, this is less relevant to me than it was a year ago; I have a 9-month old infant, so my post-entertainment adventures mostly involve cleaning up whatever has stuck to my son's face while he was enthusiastically snarfing down tofu, rice, or shredded bits of pork. And I'm ok with a quick dine-n-dash; it tests our son's patience far less than a leisurely 2 hour dinner at Madison Park Conservatory.Anyway, you should eat here. It's cheap, and better quality than most anything else you'll find for the same money. Korean Hawaiian Tacos and Kimchi Chahan for the win, I say. I saw Marination on Eat Street and immediately bookmarked them knowing I'd be passing through Seattle on my road trip to Vancouver, BC. The Sexy Tofu tacos were screaming my name!It was a matter of fate that brought me to Marination Station. It was rush hour and we just left the Space Needle and traffic was horrible. It was taking forever just to reach the 5 and I was getting a serious case of road rage. I was several blocks from the freeway entrance but it was taking the longest to get there. I gave my partner my iPhone with the directions to Marination Station already up and told him we'd be making a detour before hitting the road.My lovely navigator lead the way and we eventually found the Station. I say "eventually" because the address says its on Harvard, but I couldn't find it right away. It's tucked into the corner of the shopping center upstairs from a grocery store. It's actually easier to get to from Broadway. (thanks to the person who wrote the quick tip about it being upstairs!!) Long story short (too late for that) the Sexy Tofu Tacos were scrumdiddlyumptious!! The chicken tacos were also very good. As was the kim chi fried rice. I wish we had a food truck or restaurant like this is the Bay Area. I also wish I still ate pork (or pork by-products) so I could try a Spam slider. The ladies working there were super sweet and gave me a sticker when I mentioned I came all the way from California to try these tacos.Seattle, you may have horrible traffic, but you also have Marination Station, so I forgive you. Wow, huge bummer that Marination didn't live up to the hype it's been getting these last two years. Chris T and I dropped by with Vicki L after grabbing some drinks at Tidbit Bistro downstairs, ordering a sexy tofu taco, pork taco, and kalbi kimchi fried rice.The sexy tofu was nice and soft, with a certain subtlety in its flavors, but was on the dry side. The pork tacos weren't bad either, and had a tiny bit of kick to them, but again, were nothing special. The kimchi fried rice, which I was really looking forward to, was the biggest let down because it was so incredibly salty. Beneath all that salt though, there's some good flavor, so my suggestion is, order it to go, bring it home, and stir-fry it again after you've added in another two bowls of rice and some other veggies. In the neighborhood of 3.5 stars, actually, but I'll round up...Since I never got the chance to experience Marination Mobile, I was super excited to hear that they opened up a permanent location. &#160;The hubby and I checked it out on a nice sunny afternoon. &#160;I knew that it was located on top of QFC, but initially could not find it because... who'd thunk to check around the corner?? &#160;Anywho, there was a steady stream of customers, but the wait wasn't super long. &#160;We ordered the kimchi fried rice with kalbi, a couple of sliders, and a couple of tacos to try out, along with some soda and hawaiian sun. &#160;Service was friendly, and we got our food fairly quickly. First impression when we got our food? Dang, this is kinda expensive for almost $20. &#160;Not overly so, but still a bit pricy for the amount that we got. &#160;The sliders and tacos were ok, but I thought the slaw was a bit underseasoned... the stand out protein of choice was the miso ginger chicken. &#160;Perfectly tender and marinated and flavorful. &#160;I'd order a whole dish of that just to eat with rice! &#160;The kimchi fried rice was suuupppper salty. &#160;Like another reviewer mentioned, there was some good flavor there, but could've used some help from another bowl or two of rice. &#160;I'd be back to try some of the other items, but probably won't be going out of my way to do so... Awesome Tacos! This little gem is quick, tasty, and fresh. I enjoy the Steak tacos best, followed by pork, then chicken. The sauce the cooks throw on these little bite sized portions of joy is addicting. Be sure to add the jalapenos and the rooster sauce. Yes, now youre on your A game. What is that taste? Victory.I think I ate the about 7 tacos or so. That satisfied me, but someone of normal stomach might be good with 4-5 tacos.Enjoy your tacos outside under the sun. It is still summer, right?PS. I saw someone phone-in an order for ~120 tacos last minute for a party. This place didn't let them down (although they were swamped with activity for 30-40 minutes). Amazing. So I like to play this game when I go to Marination... &#160;It's sort of my personal remake of "Leaving Las Vegas". &#160;I play Nick Cage. &#160;The Kalua pork sliders plays booze. &#160;The kimchi rice bowl plays Elizabeth Shue. &#160;I've never actually won, but I keep trying.If this place was in a truck and it drove around town, it would be the perfect restaurant. SPAM SLIDERS.That is my crack. Tacos are amazing, especially tacos with inventive goodies on the inside. Though I am a huge fan of LA's famous Kogi truck (Korean BBQ-Mexican fusion), I have to admit I like Marination Station's faire a bit more. The hawaiian flavors are more subtle and taste fresher/lighter. I'd highly commend the spicy pork and kalbi tacos; usually 4 is the magic number to get you full but not overly stuffed. The kalua pork slider is pretty good, but the bun is just kind of "meh". Kind of reminds me of a White Castle slider bun. The quesadilla was also so-so in my book. I can't put my finger on it, but there is some weird combination of flavors that just doesn't work for me. And certainly not for $5. But stick with the tacos and you're good to go. Man, this place was hard to find.My friends and I bused here and it took us about 20 minutes to find the place. I don't know if it was mentioned on Yelp or the site itself but this place was located on top of QFC. We walked in circles starting to believe this place didn't exist until we stopped by a salon to ask. So, was it worth to finally find the place? Yes.I came here to try the kimchi fried rice and a friend's recommendation of &#160;the tacos. I ordered the kalbi kimchi fried rice and the miso ginger chicken taco.The result...Kalbi kimchi fried rice: I love kimchi. But this was a bit too kimchi-chi &#160;(totally made that up) for me. Too salty and the rice was kind of dried. It wasn't a complete disappointment though. Good size portion and plenty of kalbi.Miso ginger chicken taco: A winner! It was delicious. Absolutely great. Scrumptious. There was something about the wrap that tasted different from the usual tortilla. And the miso ginger chicken stuffing had a good balance of sweet and spicy. Too bad the taco was so small. It left my tummy lingering for more but my wallet bleeding. Cost $2.50.So, now that you know this place is on top of QFC between Harvard Ave and Broadway, I recommend trying just the tacos. Just the tacos. I have never been able to catch Marination Mobile and it saddened me because their food sounded so delicious. When I was recently in Capitol Hill I took the opportunity to seek this place out. After much deliberation, I decided on a miso ginger chicken taco, a kalbi taco, and a spam slider. Each item was like a flavor explosion in my mouth! The coleslaw and pickled jalapenos in the tacos were the perfect accompaniment to the warm and tender pieces of meat. The spam slider was tasty and everything I hoped it would be. Don't be afraid of the spam, just order it! The items are small enough that I could have probably eaten a few more tacos and sliders. Next time... Anytime I hear "kalbi" and "tacos" in the same sentence I automatically think of Kogi BBQ so I was really excited that perhaps a version of this deliciousness existed in Seattle. Sadly, it was not so. The different types of meat that were used in the tacos and sliders were ok -- not bad, not great. Most notable was the kalua pork which was tender and tasty.If you like kimchi the fried rice was yummy - it's very kimchi-y The "signature slaw" that tops almost everything was pretty bland this day, making everything taste kind of one note and boring. Take the Kogi truck. Shoot the tires with your gun so it can't move. Bam. I give you Marination Station.It's very difficult to find. I circled that block three times before I realized it's on the SECOND FLOOR, in the corner of the parking lot, facing EAST. You can take the escalators up to the second level from Broadway and Pike, next to the QFC entrance. When you come up, you'll see it right away.The concept is the same. Korean marinated meat in tortilla. They also have other items that are inventive and explorative. By now, everyone's heard of the Kogi truck - Marination station is literally the Kogi truck's food being served out of a small restaurant. Spend 20 minutes eating marinated Korean meat in tortilla with a bottle of HITE for lunch. It's a perfect way to spend a Seattle afternoon lunch time. :0) Arrived around one for lunch today.There was a long line out the door that didn't move very fast, but I had time so I waited.I had the 2 beef tacos, they were $2.25 each. &#160;They were decent the beef was puled so it was not chewy and the jalapenos on top with the coleslaw was a nice touch.So all in all they were ok tacos. &#160;Not worth the long wait, and were a little small for the price.FYI: They accept credit cards with a $10 minimum. and you can park in the lot next to them, the first 30 minutes are free. I've already written a raving review about Marination Mobile, so it's no surprise that I'm in love with the Station version as well. Best part about Marination Station? They're open all day and stay in one place. Plus no gravel in my shoe.The food is still excellent and the tofu is still sexy. Love the little patio area outside for weirdo-watching (you know what I'm talking about). Now there's no excuse for all you Marination virgins out there...free 30 minute parking, they accept credit cards, and they serve alcohol. Store Location: Its on top of QFC, this place is obscured from the parking lot. but its right by the UPS store. &#160; I had this place bookmarked for a while now, finally got to try it this weekend. &#160;My bf and I shared kimchee fried rice with kalbi, kalbi/ginger chicken tacos and pork sliders. &#160;I liked the kalbi taco, the cabbage stuff in the taco goes well with kalbi. &#160;Overall, the food is pretty salty, especially the fried rice. &#160;I admit that the taste is pretty unique, although not exactly da local hawaiian kine taste which we were expecting when we got our food. = \ &#160;Might be cool to have option of Portuguese sausage or kalua pork with those tacos. &#160; &#160;Thumbs up for serving beer &amp; hawaiian sun! I'd like to think I was one of the OG's...back when they used to set up shop at the factory gravel parking lot across Safeco field. It's inspiring to see how far they've come...makes me wanna start my own mobile food business. Kudos to Kamala, Roz, and their staff for all their hard work! QUICK TIP: Often imitated, never duplicated. You can't go wrong with anything. Kahlua pork sliders are a MOS DEF MUST, especially since there isn't anything like it out there. If you're lucky, hit up the torta! I'm a regular. I've tried everything and now I have a standard order- Kalua pork slider + Spicy pork taco ($2.25 ea)- my usual. I love the combo of the soft meat with the crunchy, tangy slaw.- Kalbi beef is fatty, salty and overcooked.- Kim Chi Quesadilla is pretty tasty.- &#160;Kimchi Rice ($5.50) is ok, kind of dry. Very large in portion and the fried egg is nice, but the quantity of rice outweighs the delicate friend egg. I would get it with pork or tofu. Perfect just prior to heading in to grocery shop next door.
Oh Kate's how I love thee.This bar is fabulous. From the time we moved into Wallingford, until the last second before we moved out of state this was our go to bar. And unfortunately, not many bars measure up to them.Happy hour is great! Tasty bar food and it is all half price! Plus they have drink specials too! Lots of good "certain day of the week" deals, fun events (Trivia with Billy is SWEET) and great bartenders. Free pool and darts. Lots of seating!Seriously, I miss you Kate's Pub. You are a great, great bar. Can't complain about a thing here. &#160;Half price food for happy hour can't be beat! Service/Bartenders are the best in town and if you are looking for karaoke, look no further than Kate's. &#160;Best holiday parties, great beer selection on tap, food is awesome, I could go on and on. &#160;To be fair I'll try to come up with a criticism...it would be nice if the bathrooms were bigger. I love this place! ...has to have one of the best happy hour's ever. 1/2 off EVERYTHING (food-wise) on their menu every day 4-7 pm. seriously awesome. and the food is good! *macaroni and cheese (cheesy deliciousness) *hummus plate: housemade hummus was surprisingly good, served with warm and soft pita triangles, carrot and celery sticks, roasted red peppers, tomato slices...and maybe something else that i've plum forgottenon a previous visit about a month ago the nachos here were pretty good: there was enough cheese down to the last chip (which is an unfortunate nacho rarity!) and the vegetarian version was full of black beans, salsa, sour cream, and jalapenos, however the cheese wasn't all the way melted and they were only lukewarm; that was a bummer. eric and eric were the bartender-servers the last two times i was in and they are very good: super attentive and friendly. love all the pictures of "kates" on the wall. obviously a lot of regulars here (alot of UW-ers) and it's easy to see why - it's a very comfortable, laid back, fun-and-friendly-people-type place with good food, great food and drink specials, and events. front room was a damn fine place to watch the apple cup this year, too, and could have only been better had the COUGARS won :) Decent beer selection at decent prices and a bar with plenty of seating in a surprisingly large space. Plus, free darts and free pool (lumpy pool table, but still, free). Couldn't be better right? But wait! The constant smell of greasy food being cooked! Gotta admit, I haven't tried any of it, but it sure smells good and doesn't look bad either. I like the vibe of this place, especially at off hours and on weeknights. It can get crowded during prime time, so be warned. If you are here on a weeknight, the bartenders will roam around to check on you and likely remember your name if you open a tab. Not to shabby.My one problem: The Juke Box explicitly states "No Journey," and yet Journey was playing while I was there. Maybe I missed the joke, but I would have been happier if it wasn't a joke!Make sure you get pitchers for the table or stick with the cheap well drinks. You'll save a lot over pints and fancy drinks. Of course, this advice works for just about any bar... All the same, good place. Two things you need to keep in mind when visiting Kates... 1) If the next day is a day off classes for the U, DO NOT COME HERE! There will be about 10 thousand frat boys and their twig like girlfriends there. 2) they have AWESOME karaoke, great song list! The DJ is great and super nice, the list can get pretty long but he'll let you know as soon as he can if he thinks you can't make it before the end of the night.Beer, cider and liquor make for a pretty good bar (not to mention one or two OUTRAGEOUSLY cute bartender boys)... I try to be DD when I come here so I never drink much if at all and they usually will comp me a coke if they realize I'm the lady behind the wheel that night. I've gotten pretty harassed by a few of their customers (ie drunk frat boys trying to pick up on this hot mama) and it's gone pretty unheaded but seriously the guys that work here are too busy to pick up on everything so just be fair warned when you go that this place can quickly turn into a meat market without you even noticing it and before long some drunk guy is practically shaking you he's leaning on you so hard slurring out that he loves your glasses. A-M-A-Z-I-N-GAnd what is more comforting than well-made pub fare? When it is half-priced, of course! Their hh is daily, but even with nornal prices, it is very affordable. The staff is friendly, attentive, and pour a mean pint. Wed night is Karaoke, and &#160;with a crowded house, get there early to grab a seat. Dear Kate's,I love you. You are my favorite bar in all of the land. That said, it makes me sad that I am so far away from you now and can't enjoy absurdly strong Jack &amp; Diet's and karaoke every Wednesday. Your happy hour is the best deal ever and your meatloaf sandwich is amazing. I can't wait until I am living in Seattle again and can once more frequent this lovely place.Love,Calana. my love for kate's has grown exponentially. Half price food during happy hour, which is every day for a generous amount of time. A staff who remembers your face, if not your name. And generally just good people, serving good beer, and big pours of shots. Pro-tip: Saturday is $3 Jameson night.
Nice location. No Birkenstocks lol. At least I didn't see any today. Paper bags and bring-your-own. Natural. Organic. Grass-fed. Alternative. Bulk. Everything you'd expect at a healthy foods store, including the higher prices. Location:Near the Fremont Bridge in Seattle. Parking:There's parking underground, though I've often found street parking. Quality:Earth and green friendly organic natural foods. Service:No hotties, or eye-candy, &#160;but the people have been okay with service. Return?:Probably if I'm in the neighbourhood. The journey to PCC is an exercise of frustration filled with contempt. Fremont, otherwise self-indulgently known as the "Center of the Universe" (which, I'm sure, is held by another equally arrogant town), is situated by a canal and surrounded by hills littered by poor drivers, oblivious pedestrians and poorly designed city streets.However contemptible this neighborhood is with all its pretension I can't help but find the lunch options at PCC to be incredibly delicious. Their prepackaged salads are always fresh and their small hot food selection always fit the bill, whatever my mood.If I'm in a particularly good mood, I even play a little game of "I spy with my eye an ironically-tattooed hipster, wannabe-green yuppie, mom-with-too-many-kids-in-tow or old-pony-tailed hippie" to alleviate the short but frustrating drive into civil Hades.But $0.79 for a thing of dressing? C'mon! (-1 star) Yes it's one of the most expensive supermarkets you will ever go to. However, some of the brands here are actually cheaper because of how many people go here, so it's not bad for some stuff like Fage yogurt. Also, if you order an entire case of whatever product, they give you 10% off for it being a bulk order. If you're a member, they send out a coupon in their newsletter for 10% off your entire purchase once a month. However, what you pay for in price you definitely get for the freshness and quality. They also have the largest vitamin selection I've come across in any grocery store, and very nice personal and home goods from natural and holistic brands. All of the produce and meats are also labeled from local, sustainable vendors. They also have the nicest dry foods section that I've ever seen--all of the most tasty granola, trail mix and that sort of food. The hot foods section is also pretty good as long as you're at PCC not too late for the freshest selection. This PCC location is the nicest one that I've been to in the Seattle area. The workers at PCC are all very helpful and knowledgeable, and really care about helping you out. All in all, yes they are pricey but it's worth it. PCC is a very pricey grocery store. &#160;I routinely shop at one of their competitors (Whole Foods), and I find many more bargains there. &#160;I rely on PCC for ice cream, bread, wine/cider, and other little treats, but it just doesn't offer the value or selection I need. &#160; I think many regulars rely on it for prepared foods (I don't shop for those very often) from the deli).So 4-5 stars for treats, but only 2 stars for price &amp; selection, thus, 3 stars overall. Out of all the organic/natural food stores, PCC is my top choice, and this location is perfectly convenient for me! &#160;I shop at PCC for their fresh produce, grass-fed meats, organic dairy products, beer/wine section and of course the made-to-go foods. &#160;PCC offers quality ingredients and products for a reasonable price and I always feel taken care of here. &#160;Also, it doesn't hurt that there's a covered parking lot too! Here is to my 100! review.When living in Seattle I have tended to end up living near a PCC and for good reason. There isn't a better grocery store in Seattle. Cheaper? Oh yeah, just try Safeway or QFC but try finding quality organic anything. Besides, the up-cost of organic products is simply what one should be paying. Mostly, this place just rules for the quality of its staff, its great produce and its homegrown status. PCC has a great ready-to-eat prepared foods section, which is fantastic when I don't feel like cooking (which is every night) and don't feel like restaurant food (which is not that often, but does happen). &#160;Their pizza is actually surprisingly good. &#160;Yes PCC is expensive, but so is every natural foods store. &#160;Their produce is excellent and selection on other stuff is quite good. I shop here quit a bit for various items and I would love to give you more stars but there are several shortfalls that the out-of-town Whole Foods has figured out.No seating except for outside! &#160;Three or four tables in winter just isn't enough. &#160;You are in the middle of an urban area with lots of day-lunch crowd, find a way for more tables inside the store PLEASE! Oh! Emerald City Salad, Smoked Mozzarella Pasta Salad, Yummy Flavored Tofu, and Dolma how do I love thee....let me count the ways! The reason I love this location of PCC so much has got to be the quality of the staff and the offerings in the deli section here. Not to mention the fact that this PCC has a parking garage right underneath it for those days when everybody and their dog is enjoying Fremont. The prices of the grocery items are a little pricier than than your average grocery store, but keep in mind that you are getting higher quality organic foods and gluten free options rather than your typical grocery fare. Also, how many grocery stores offer opportunities for cooking classes with their talented staff and a podcast? (Check out their website @ http://www.pccnaturalmar&#8230; ) Don't forget, this location is also open 6am-Midnight &#160;daily making shopping for better food options possible for those of us who work too much. Check this location out, you will be sure to discover something new and most like quite tasty with each visit! The best store to find food in Seattle. Forget about whole foods. Mecca. &#160;Immaculate, beautifully designed store. &#160;Fantastic deli food. &#160;Really great staff. &#160; As a vegan, I bring my lunch to work most of the time. &#160;If I forget, their hot deli bar always has some great vegan options. &#160;I love their card selection. &#160;I can always find something that's just right for the moment. &#160;Black beans and rice in the hot food section is very satisfying. &#160;And they have cool things like nutritional yeast in the condiment area. &#160;if you like good, healthy, well made, well sourced food - I think it's the best in the city. &#160;Vegan donuts, scones and muffins, too. Love this store, but calling them is freakin' pointless. My attempt to save gas by calling to see if they have certain seasonal varieties of produce (Apples) has been in vain. They'll put you on hold repeatedly and like goldfish completely forget you're there. C'mon. The more I learn about "Big Agriculture", and &#160;the corporate machine that is how our food is grown and distributed (and sprayed with toxic pesticides), the more I want to spend every penny of my food budget at PCC. &#160;It's so important to me that my food is organic and sourced as much as possible from local and organic farms. &#160;The produce is better than any conventional grocery store, hands down. &#160;And the staff is always friendly and are starting to feel like my second family! &#160;Thanks for all the work you do to save organic farmland... Fremont store is the most friendly store of all. Even during the Fremont fair they extended full courtesy to every single member of the mad rush that hit the store. Great selection as usual and Thanks for serving us. staff is usually pretty decent, but i've had a few crappy cashiers. &#160;insulting your courtesy clerk in front of customers doesn't make you look cool, ultra-hipster cashier lady. &#160;just sayin'.and this may not be breaking news, but there's a parking garage under the store! &#160;holy crap! &#160;i'd been struggling with the shitty back-in parking on 34th or parking blocks and blocks away for almost a year. &#160;stupid me, i guess.it would be really awesome if i could get frozen loaves of bread (rudi's 7 grain and flax) instead of the horribly molested loaves on the shelves... but everytime i ask (at any PCC), they're o"out of that one". &#160;boo. I primarily shop at PCC. &#160;Quality is great and staff is friendly. &#160;It's refreshing to have a store with more choice of bulk grains than types of potato chips. &#160;My main complaint is I still need to go to a Safeway or Fred Meyer on occasion for a few staples that PCC either doesn't carry, or the organic items are in the wrong quantity or too pricy (e.g., a five-pound bag of sugar). &#160;I would like it if they could deviate from their "pureness" a little without becoming a Whole Foods. PCC is a great supermarket for natural food and household products. &#160;If quality organics and information regarding the source of your food is important to you, this is your grocery store. Special diet? They can help. They are great at listing ingredients and employees throughout the store are helpfull and know their stuff, just ask. I highly recommend trying their deli food as well, just ask for a sample!
It's not awful - it's just not that great, either.Not awful: our waiter last night was a total hotty with a bemused smile that never wavered when our party of 5 became a party of 6 and then a party of 7. A plus: he had interesting tats. If you sit outside and wear really dark shades you can stare openly and not get caught. At least that's what I tell myself. Hotty waiter, I'm watching you.Also not awful: the 3 girls gorged themselves on noodles and brown rice (no, not THAT brown rice - white rice drowned in soy sauce - silly).Close to awful: this place needs a better wine selection and for GAWD'S SAKE some spirits. It would have made the bleh food taste a lot better.So here's the sitch: if you want pan-Asian, you'll do better at Zao. But really folks, pick a derned Asian country and then go to a resto that specializes in the fare of the country you picked. This is another great quality restaurant on top of the hill! They have a great selection of dishes that span most of Asia and are all pretty tasty. It's great that you can have sushi; Vietnamese spring rolls, Singapore noodles and pineapple curry fried rice under one roof. Good stuff, Maynard!You will most likely have to wait in line for a seat during dinner hours. Seating in the restaurant is a little tight though. I cannot wrong this place whatsoever. It's so much better than trendy, small menu Ototo across the street. The have a large menu, friendly staff, great service, super fresh fish, and a wide variety of stuff for picky eaters and those who don't like fish. They can accommodate medium/ large groups too, which is nice. It's a casual place, but the sushi chefs take themselves seriously. Sit at the bar and tell the chef to go to town and make you his selection. Fun times. This is not mass produced sushi or conveyor belt sushi. It's perfectly fresh and firm. Get here early though, because they don't have unlimited space. Outside seating es perfecto en el verano. If you can't decide if you're in the mood for Thai, Japanese, Chinese or Vietnamese then heading to Chinoise will not make matters easier because they serve it all--which incidentally is great for a group that can't agree on just one thing.I went for lunch and opted for sushi--which was excellent and spendier than my usual lunch ($17 for two large, filling rolls). &#160;If you like tuna, you may very well love the Hawaiian Poke Roll. I still smile with pleasure as I remember it. &#160;Everything else on the menu looked spectacular and I can't wait to go back to try the rest. &#160;Seating was available indoors and out. &#160;And while the decor was simple, everything was reasonably nice and there was a ton of natural light (a must for me). &#160;Also--the service was potentially good, our waitress was either trying to give us some space or forgetting about us, it was hard to tell. &#160;Either way it was an enjoyable and leisurely lunch. We stumbled in here after being scared off by the line at Otono, and were pleasantly surprised. &#160;Great menu with a selection from Japanese to Chinese to Thai. &#160;Portions were generous and prices were reasonable. &#160;I started with the Hawaiian Poke salad and it was nice, fresh, and plenty tangy. &#160;Went with a TNT roll and it was absolutely delish. &#160;There's 3 of these in town and while it's hard to say go out of your way to hit one, they're never a bad choice. Been here twice for sushi and Pan-Asian. Good if you have someone who's not a sushi fan. General Tso's the best I ever had. I usually get the Ume Combo, chef's choice, which can be a bit of a gamble. The second time around, it was busy and the sushi did not arrive as cold and fresh as it should be. I do recommend it for the pan-asian. Better sushi can be found elsewhere. One of my all-time favorite restaurants, and a great place to take a mixed crowd (veg/vegan and meat eaters). You can get everything Pan Asian from sushi to teriyaki, Phad Thai to Vietnamese noodle bowls. My personal favorite would have to be the Buddhist Tofu Stir Fry - great fried tofu, broccoli, and snow peas in a delicious, light sauce with rice. Light but filling. Also great miso &amp; green tea. The wait can be a while, so be prepared, sometimes you get lucky and can get right in, if you're in a hurry, the earlier you go, the better. 3 Stars for variety, service, and cleanliness. As most people have noted here, the value of this establishment is selection Asian Fusion style. I liked the TNT sushi rolls and the pot stickers. I wasn't very demanding when I sat down here, mostly because I didn't know what I wanted at the time. Chinoise is the kind of neighborhood cafe I'd like to hang out in more often. I can get some paperwork done here over lunch, grab a light meal here with a friend, or simply do some writing over a cup of tea. Next time I come here I'll try their Bowl Noodle Hot in Pleaseeasaur fasion. Eh~ That's right. &#160;Just an "Eh~" &#160;Not phenomenal but not aweful. &#160;It's place to go when you can't decide where you want to go. &#160;If anything, their noodle dishes are decent. &#160;They do actually have pretty good Vietnamese noodle salad bowl. &#160;I would go else where for Sushi. &#160;I would have to say best out of all Chinoise in Seattle. i love pan asian that actually has good sushi. i couldn't believe the size of the fish served on the nigiri, is it a seattle thing in general or just this restaurant? &#160;also, coming from the east coast, i found the use of fresh veggies and whatnot in the rolls to be different... again is this just unique to this restaurant? in Boston, you rarely have anything in a maki roll other than cucumber or avocado. the cold sake ruby was excellent as well. i was told to try the pearl which is less dry. i'm glad i stuck to my guns. the ruby was not at all dry. very tasty. I have been eating here for years, and will continue to do so. &#160;It can get very busy at times, but what great place can't? &#160;The food is great 9 times out of 10, and it's great during lunch or dinner.
All I've had here is the Bahn Mi, but man, that's all i really need here. And I have to say, these guys have the best Bahn Mi in Seattle. there is a place in Laos that has THE best vietnamese sandwiches ever. i used to eat two and sometimes three a day when i was there. not having that here makes me sad, but saigon deli is an adequate replacement. it is nice and spicy and the pickled veggies add a clean sour bite to it. there isn't too much mayo and the pork is decent. i've only had vietnamese sandwiches at three places in seattle so far, but saigon deli is far and away the best.
Near the convention center and want a sweet treat? &#160;Stop here and enjoy.Enough said. &#160;Reliably crepes, fair price, friendly/fast service. I decided to take advantage of the wintery sunshine and venture out for lunch today, but none of the usual spots appealed. &#160;Hey, I thought, a crepe sounds really good and I've been wanting to try that little spot in the Convention Center (which is actually out of the convention center, since it's a walk-up street stand, but whatever).There was no line, and the gal took my order right away (roasted chicken) and I paid a little over $7. &#160;Then, she made the food fresh before my eyes, hot and filling. &#160;They give you the option of a) a box, b) a plate, or c) wrapping it for eating while you walked. &#160;I picked A and ate when I got back to the office. &#160;The crepe is a good size, more than enough food for lunch, and while it's nowhere near the best crepes I've eaten in my life, it certainly satisfies. &#160;Prices are a smidge high but it's downtown Seattle and caters to the convention (read, tourist) crowds, so it's to be expected. &#160;I plan to come back and try some of the sweet crepes next time. Working nearby, I've always been curious about this place but somehow never tried until this morning. I grabbed the wild smoked salmon crepe. $8, so not cheap but not ridiculous. The ingredients were very fresh tasting - spinach, smoked salmon, a french creme and freshly squeezed lemon. It was very good. Like the Terminator, I'll be back. Cherries Jubilee was a mushy mess. Tiny amount of slivered almonds with odd texture. It was like they were blanched instead of roasted. Vanilla ice cream and cherries did not seem fresh. Very skimpy with the Nutella crepe.
I got past the funky ambient smell and the moderate chaos, and I am glad I did: &#160;Best Banh Mi since I lived in Houston. &#160;They had all kinds of Vietnamese items that I have loved in past days (the banana leaf wraps with rice and pork; steamed buns), but I am pretty much focused on $2 sandwiches of insane tastiness. This could be some place in Heaven.I was in Seattle, visiting my boy John C, and we wandered through the ID looking for good food. &#160;We stumbled upon this place and decided to go in, based on a review he read off of Yelp. &#160;Once inside, it IS the chaos that Sean describes...in fact, we might have been there when he was. &#160;There are all these women behind the counter, all kinds of weird foods wrapped in styrofoam and plastic and boxes of stuff around the room. &#160;We ordered the #1 (grilled pork) and boy were we glad we did! &#160;There is no order to things except make eye contact with someone and order. &#160;They throw it in a plastic bag and you are on your way. &#160;There is some parking next to it and a park (Kobe park) closeby that is a nice place to eat your sandwich. &#160;The sandwiches are fabulous here and cheap. &#160;The people are as friendly as you'd expect from anyone who wants to move you out of the store, which is fine. &#160;You don't come to a place like this for conversation. &#160;You do it for the sandwich! The perfect place to stop on your way to the baseball game--grab a $2.25 banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) and you will have that much more money for your $8 beer at the game. &#160;Thanks to Ron M. for showing us the light! &#160;We did discover though that the $2 spring rolls are not such a good buy...probably not a good idea to buy spring rolls that are sitting on a table that is not temperature controlled. &#160;Everything else rocks! The first time I pulled up to this place I was sure I wasn't going to eat anything. From the outside it doesn't look very clean or organized. Garbage was piled along the back wall and the parking lot was well... dirty. As I got closer to the door I noticed a King County Department of Health car parked right in front. My thoughts ,"Well that seals it. No way I'm eating here." Then I noticed the two Department of Health workers leaving the deli carrying armloads of food. OK, if I'm going to die of dysentery at least it will be county sanctioned. Once inside, the out look gets even worse. The place is chaos in a box. There is no real line, people keep asking me if I'm in line and I say, "I'm not sure." Then someone behind the counter sees my fear and asks me what I want. I order the veggie sandwich for $2.00 and a can of Pepsi. I wait a moment longer and I have my sandwich and pop in a white plastic bag. I walk out to my car, drive to work, and as I start to eat the sandwich, I realize I am currently eating the best damn sandwich I have ever had. What I have learned from this is that one should not fear chaos, one should embrace it. Food here is cheap and good. They do take credit and debit cards but charge a .50 cent fee. Parking is available in their lot, but can sometimes be hard to find when they get busy. Ok, so I am relatively new to the Seattle Area...about 7 months now, and I finally tried a Bahn Mi....happiness in my belly.......I love Vietnamese food and have been eating it for years, I mean if Pho was a woman I would have married her 7 years ago....So imagine my suprise when a friend of mine from out of town was here and we wondered past this joint and split a fabulous BBQ Pork Sammich.....The only thing that upset me was the fact that we split a sandie and I didn't get my own.... I love the sandwiches here!I usually end up ordering at least 5-10 so that I can share my love with people. &#160;Co-workers have come around to a sandwich filled with pickled daikon, cucumber, carrots and jalapeos.The price is truly amazing. &#160;I don't know how they stay in business, but on occasion...business is too good and there is a long line, but truly, this place is worth the wait.Although sometimes, the mystery pate can be a little intimidating and scary, the sheer volume of food those nice ladies turn over practically ensures that nothing goes bad.There are other Bahn Mi places around, but this one has parking. &#160;If you've never had a Vietnamese sandwich (Bahn Mi) you could do far worse than here. As a Vietnamese person from the bay area I hold it to be one of my sacred duties to find and endorse the best Vietnamese sandwich place in any city i inhabit. For Seattle's international district, I humbly support Saigon Deli as the anointed winner..for now.I recommend the grilled pork sandwich; if you're game, add pate. Tip-you can also request extra meat (I think it's a buck)If you're feeling super adventurous, try the spring rolls or rice rolls. But eat them quick- as they will spoil if left out for more than a few hours. I had sticker shock when I saw the prices. I couldn't believe my eyes. Is it really? No it can't be...Maybe they haven't updated their price list?....So I asked the lady. Yes, those are the correct prices.Time warp prices.I've never paid so little for a Banh Mi. $1.50-2BUCKS!! Holy smacks!!!!!!! Not even in the 1980's have I ever paid for anything less than $3!! Everything is well made here and fresh ! I've tried everything but my favorite is the tofu and egg banh mi. However, everything is excellent here. I just love the combination of freshly pan fried tofu with two sunnyside up eggs on a toasted baguette filled with pickled daikon, carrots and cilantro drizzled with some soy and fishsauce. mmmmm..
sooo coool! must go! I had the pad thai with fake chicken and my boyfriend had the duck soup! He is a meat eater and said that he wouldn't have been able to tell that the duck was fake!very nice people that work there also, weird.., but nice :)also, you might not be able to find the place too, the sign is hard to read and it is a really small place. I'm a huge fan of noodles soups. Living in Bremerton it's pretty hard to find a good bowl of... uh... anything, but whenever I'm up on the hill and the mood for noodles has struck me this place has always come through in a pinch. I try to curb my meat eating ways everynow and then and it's nice finding a place that can do a solid meal without being meat-centric. Great noodles, great pad thai, and they actually can get it spicy enough to really register with me. Not really the greatest place when you are in a rush though as it is normally extremely packed. Still, I love it. The first time I went to In the Bowl I ordered my dish with tofu because I am so used to avoiding all things chicken, pork, beef, etc. that it didn't quite register right off the bat that here I could break that habit. &#160;And since I am not a person who really cares for tofu I was quite jealous when my boyfriend's "duck" curry showed up. &#160;Or maybe it was just a bruised ego from being so absentminded.My tofu misstep aside, the dish was excellent just like all the others that have come after it. &#160;If there is one thing I love, it is a restaurant where I, le veggie monster, can order absolutely anything off the menu and In the Bowl is one of the few places around where I actually have to take some time to look through my options. &#160;It's also one of the first places close to my apartment that I fell in love with when I first moved to the city and for that it will always have a special place in my heart. &#160;Spicy, tasty, creative and a good deal for your money. &#160;What else could ya want? Excellent Food!! Wow...this place is popular...they were packed when we arrived. &#160;i signed us up on the little sheet that they have including my number(the lady suggested it, and it was a decent idea). &#160; We then wandered off to grab a drink next door. &#160;The wait wasn't too bad, seeing as how it was super busy and we weren't at the top of the list. Maybe 15 minutes total.We were led to a tiny table by an equally tiny Asian lady...a bit cramped, but right by the heater...SCORE! &#160;It was close quarters, but that allowed us to see peoples food around us...and it all looked amazing. &#160; I didn't bring a super amount of money, so i looked for the cheaper priced items on the menu. &#160;There were a bunch of decisions for a decent price.I ordered the see-though noodle...3* and my friend ordered the Donald duck and some pot stickers(which she graciously shared with me). &#160;The food was epic...the service was fast. &#160;And everything on the menu is vegetarian/vegan.Word to the wise--The bathroom/storage area was kinda weird.....it was a jungle of fake plants with one of those weird electronic pictures of the waterfall that moves. &#160;I came out laughing and trying to squeeze past the ladder that was wedged by the door.Evidently people know of the greatness this place holds...it pretty much stayed packed the entire time. Always Good foods!! This is the best place to have spicy food.. I love there soup and stir fry.. If your a vegetarian and want to eat a good food should go there. Sometimes it's 10pm in my apartment in Los Angeles, and I start fantasizing about paying someone in Seattle to get a couple orders of In the Bowl's Melting Culture appetizer, put them in a big insulated container, hop on a nice quick two-hour flight, and deliver it to me here, hopefully still warm. I guess that plan wastes a lot of fossil fuel. Otherwise I see no problem with it. For a quick, tasty and extremely filling vegetarian meal, you can't beat In The Bowl. As it says in Devanagari script on the door, "Asia Pleasure In The Bowl" is what you get with each dish. My friends and I have tried a half a dozen or more of their menu items, and the range of flavors they dish out, along with the exceptional quality of the fake meat, is outstanding. I recommend the broccoli beef and the pumpkin with peanut curry (the latter's a winter seasonal item.) The fresh Young Coconut is yummy too, as is the bowl of rice dessert with coconut milk and sea salt that you get after your meal (if you don't, make sure to ask for it.)I wish they had booze, though - the spice levels at 5 stars are just enough to pack a goodly punch, for those of you that are accustomed to high heat, and a cold, sweet Sapporo would be an ideal counter-balance. 4.5 stars.  I CAN'T believe this made Yelp's "hot" (as in spicy) list for Seattle. If you really DO like spicy food. &#160;I don't think there is anywhere in Seattle that can help you (based on Yelp's "hot" list). &#160;I always order 5 stars here and I taste a little spicy-ness (honestly their 5star is like 2/5 stars maybe for me). &#160; However, my friends sometimes cry from the spicy-ness from here.... so I think actually I am a freak. I have ordered several noodle dishes and basil basil. &#160;Yes, this place is vegetarian so keep that in mind if you don't like weird textured "meat" you will probably think this place is bad. &#160;Also, if you don't like SUPER salty foods, you will not like this place either. &#160;I think their food is really tasty (cause its really salty) for vegetarian food, but then I always leave the place to drink a gallon of water (really, I do.). &#160;Sometimes the vegetables are stir-fried until they are soft, but sometimes they are still a bit raw and crunchy. &#160;If you like to eat vegetables for their "true" flavors, I would not recommend this place either, as I mentioned earlier, everything is very salty and you cant really taste anything but their sauces. &#160;Everything is served very (temperature) hot, so keep that in mind if you go to this restaurant starving and want to immediately swallow your food. &#160;Alot of people complain this place is busy, but I usually go during the week day and find this place empty. Yummy in my tummy!You have to try this tiny little restaurant.The vibe is pretty awesome, everyone is super nice, the clientele was really young and cool too.The restaurant could probably only seat about 20 people, so take out is probably a good idea.Everything I had was delicious.Parking may be a bit of a problem since it's on a busy street and I didn't see any parking near by. Pumpkin soup with beef. So good. I'm always excited when I can eat everything on the menu without careful scrutiny beyond deciding what flavours I like. I haven't had meat or meat analogues in years, so I can't accurately compare, but the texture was a little offputting, in that I felt like I was chewing on tendons and stuff. So... points for realism? The soup itself was so flavourful and tasty, and packed full of veggies and "meat" so I was full before I finished my meal.The actual restaurant location is tiny. When it's cold, don't sit near the door, or try to take your food to go. Definitely will be back to try other dishes! This is my favorite Thai restaurant! And one of my favorite restaurants in general. Almost anything on their menu is guaranteed to be good. Usually I order Ginger Asparagus, and it's got a ton of fresh, perfectly cooked vegetables. And I love that they serve wild blended rice. They do spicy in a way that seems different than a lot of other Thai places, because it tastes like they do more than just add some chili flakes. The peanut sauce is awesome too, because it doesn't taste like just peanut butter, which some Thai restaurants can do. I recommend the fake beef, because to me, it tastes better than real beef. (The chicken tastes a bit like bologna.)The Thai iced tea is the best I've had in Seattle, and I also love the rice pudding that they serve as dessert. An impressive array of soups, noodles, curries and more. All veggie. No beer or wine but good Thai ice tea. I got green bean w/fresh tofu and yakisoba, medium. I'm a spice freak so medium wasn't enough for me, but I was happy to add chili paste. Enough for 2 meals and pretty cheap! Here's a hint! Order take out then go next door to the Bus Stop bar! There'll even deliver to you next door when it's ready. There are few finer evenings on capitol hill than spicy noodles from In the Bowl with whiskey drinks at Bus Stop. Delicious thai food options. &#160;I had the pumpkin curry with "duck". &#160;My first time trying soy duck (or any kind of duck for that matter) and I thought it was moist and satisfying. WOW! I'm half Thai, if that accounts for anything, and have been searching all around Los Angeles for as close to Thailand food as possible here &#160;and haven't really found it. &#160;I went to "In The Bowl" during my trip to Seattle a few months back and I've found it! Now, if only they delivered to LA!! The staff here are Thai and super helpful and friendly! &#160;Although it's all vegetarian, they do not skip out on capturing the essential flavors of Thai food. &#160;They have some of the best curries I've had in the States, their fake meat seems real enough and their soups were great!This place was SO good that I went there two nights in a row during my five day stay in Seattle. &#160;Would've gone more, but there's too much great food in Seattle to stay only in Capitol Hill :) Whenever I'm in the mood for thai food, this is my #1 choice. They have tons of vegan "meat" options and different dishes..all the ones I've tried I've liked. My favorite is Pad See Ew with "beef." Most of the staff is super friendly too, with the exception of one waitress, who always seems sort of stony.The take out time is pretty fast, as well.The only bummer about this place is the size, not much seating. The sign on the door says "Asian Pleasure" and it ain't no lie. &#160;This place is fabulous. &#160;5 stars spice-level at this place is for serious sweat lodge style, so don't mess around unless you really, really like it spicy. &#160;The menu is really long and each section is termed an "episode." &#160;:) &#160;100% vegan. &#160;I usually choose from the variety of noodle bowls with different broths, spices, and vegetables and your choice of protein and noodle. &#160;I particularly like the gluten-based "duck." &#160;Their peanut sauce is of the sweet variety, with a dust of cinnamon. &#160;Dessert is complimentary -- a small sweet bean and soymilk dish. &#160;The space itself is quite small, but I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table during dinner. &#160;Make sure you visit the restroom -- it's a brightly-colored mini-shrine -- very fun. Every once in a while when I feel like cutting on my meat this is the place I frequent. They have an amazing vegetarian menu. They have fake meat too. The spice level is slightly more than other places (a 1 is more like a 2 and a 4 is more like I'm gonna regret this in the morning) so if you can't handle spice remember to mention this while placing the order. &#160;The soups and curry "episodes" are especially amazing. &#160;Try the Tom Yum soup with duck - it's amazing. Pros: Soups, noodle, curry, rice dishes are amazing. &#160;The menu has a very long list of items you can pick from. Service is fast. &#160;Food is cheap. Staff is friendly, though the dude that works at night can be a bit weird at times. Cons: During peak hours you might have to wait a bit to be seated. This place is not good for large groups. Ideal for 2-4 people groups. It's a bit congested. I'd recommend ordering a to-go. &#160;Bottomline: This is one of those places on the hill you must definately try. We've been here a couple times and it would be a 3.5 if it were allowed but I'm inclined to round down on this one. This is why...on our latest visit, the soy sauce on the pad see ew is super thick and it drenched the noodles. Yes, that's just personal preference but the kicker is the randomly pieces of wood (look liked parts from possible a cooking utensil) that were in my bf's dish. The prices are a little high but I think I'm just not use to Seattle prices yet. Don't get me wrong, I'd still come back but not for awhile. I discovered this place about a month ago, and I've already been back four times. &#160;This is my new favorite Thai restaurant in Seattle. &#160;The food is absolutely amazing, and very authentic. &#160;This isn't Thai-American cuisine, it's real Thai food, and it's awesome (they're not shy with the spice either:).And for those of you who are leery of the Vegetarian label, despair not. &#160;The first time I ate there I had no idea that the meat was fake, and actually remarked to my dining companion how much I liked the beef. &#160;This place is definitely worth checking out. Update after three years of eating here...still like it but everything tastes vaguely the same. Still a great vegetarian option. five stars. is that the maximum amount i can give? then five stars. one of the best places if you're a vegan, or prefer to have vegan options. everything on the menu is phenomenal (and it's an extensive menu). when i die, this will be one of the things i'll miss in life. Wow... this place is hands down the best Thai food I've had in Seattle... or anywhere. &#160;Forget whether or not you are a vegetarian, this place is delicious. &#160;My favorites are the Full-filled Your Dreams (crab wontons) and the North Rileup Fried Rice w/beef. &#160;Soooo good and enough for leftovers. &#160;The only downside to this place is that it's so small and crowded, but I worry that if they expand the food won't be as good. &#160;I can live with the cramped environment or getting take out in exchange for such delicious food. &#160;Please start delivering to Beacon Hill!!! My friend took me here because I was craving Pad Thai. The restaurant itself is pretty small so be prepared to sit really close to other customers. The place doesn't have great ventilation so if you have plans right after, make sure to air out! The food here was reasonably priced and pretty good. They have a really good selection and offer all types of fake meat. I ordered the Pad Thai with tofu with two stars and man was it spicy! I've been here once and always want to go back. The food is so good! Decent prices. Cute atmosphere. You wouldn't even know it's not real meat! :) Some of the best Thai food I've ever had. Oh, how I love you ITB. And how I miss you, having moved to Wenatchee, three hours away from your noisy wait staff and foggy windows. This place was a weekly date spot for me and my man when we lived on the Hill. The waitress we usually ended up with (who probably works her buns off) came to know us and anticipate our orders- we loved and appreciated that. Our normal meal started with the chicken nuggets and melting culture (holy god, I want to eat that lumpy sauce with my fingers) with extra roti then progressed to red curry with "beef" for me and yellow noodle curry for him. We'd usually eat all of it, too, and devour the complimentary orange slices or little containers of black sticky rice they give out for dessert. PERFECT! This place is usually crowded, either too hot or too cold, &#160;typically has a wait, and it's not uncommon to hear the servers and chefs yelling at each other. Whatever. We love it.
NOTE: this review applies to the previous incarnation of the Rock 'n Roll Grill. It is now a completely different business.You know what the Ave needs? Another burger place. No, a Korean teriyaki place. Or, wait, Chinese. How about all of the above? Rock 'n Roll grill is practically a food court, serving all the above cuisines as well as a bunch of wraps, and possibly other stuff that I didn't notice. There are basically two burger menus, an 'Asian' food counter (Korean, teriyaki, Chinese) and a counter selling tortilla wraps.Over the course of several visits, I tried a good cross-section of their menu. I started with the spicy chicken teriyaki. The sauce was not bad -- sweeter than I'd have liked, but not cloying; decent spicy kick. Would have made a decent BBQ sauce. The meat, sadly, was kind of rubbery and not particularly flavorful. I also tried the bibimbap. Pretty much exactly what you'd get at any of the other Korean teriyaki places on the Ave. As always, slightly better than the teriyaki. If you order from the Asian section, I'd stick with the Korean menu. (Oh, and they have ramen.)They serve two lines of burgers: 'old-fashioned' (quarter-pound of 'fresh beef', on a sesame bun) and 'gourmet' (third of a pound of charbroiled Angus, freshness not specified, on kaiser, with more toppings to choose from). They also have chicken, fish, turkey and various vegan options. I tried an old-fashioned double cheeseburger. Not terribly impressive: the meat was dense, gray and sausagey, with no discernible crust. The Greek burger from the 'gourmet' line fared better: browner on the outside, pinker in the middle, beefy enough to taste. It came with feta and a medium-sized garden's worth of vegetables, damp enough to make the bun soggy, but I didn't mind. Both burgers came with fries. Lacking crispness, but well-seasoned, skin-on. They'll grow on you if you think of them as oddly-shaped home-fries.I haven't tried the wraps, and won't, because they're wraps. But they come with a choice of tortilla varieties, with homemade potato chips on the side.Overall, there are better places in the area to get each of these kinds of food. But if you want everything in one place, well, here you go. Went here last week to try out their menu. &#160;It looks like they had just opened that week. &#160;I noticed that they are trying to cover the broad spectrum of foods by offering different types of foods. &#160;Prices are a bit higher then some of the other competition on the Ave.Services: &#160;I tried out their 'Old Fashion' Bacon Cheeseburger and got it to bring back to work. &#160;Waiting for 15 minutes with no food in sight so I asked the cashier about my order. &#160;There was a clamoring in the kitchen a the cook said that they had already made my order. &#160;They dug through the completed tickets and found my order. &#160;I was told that they gave my order to someone else who had ordered after I did. &#160;5 more minutes past and they called the order for the person they had given my food to already. &#160;So they just boxed that one for me. &#160;Not very happy with how that went seeing as they had more then enough wait staff. &#160;2 Cashiers, 6 people in the kitchen, and 2-3 wait staff. &#160;The need to find a better way of keeping track of orders. &#160;All they ask for is a name from the person but the wait staff don't call out the names. &#160;The cooks do when the order is up but they can barely be heard. &#160;Using numbers or calling names would work better.Food: &#160;The burger was really underwhelming. &#160;The patty was small compared to the bun they used. &#160;Does seem like they only have one size of buns and it's meant for the 1/3 pound gourmet burgers and not the 1/4 classics. &#160;Vegetables were fresh and the bacon was well cooked. &#160;But the burger patty was dry and tasteless. &#160;Looks like they had pressed the burger down while cooking which drained it of any juices. &#160;Fries were undercooked and just barely done. &#160;Looked like the oil wasn't hot enough to crisp up the fries.I'll give them another try to see if they've gotten use to being open and to see if they made any improvements. &#160;Hopefully they can do better. Decent burger but fries were extremely undercooked and price was steep for the quality. To add insult to injury, they don't take American Express despite the emblem on their front window. Not a big deal but still annoying. If they learn how to use the fryer this place might be ok, but you can do much better on the ave for the price. Felt glum about impending graduation, so I decided to treat myself right and use my buy one meal get one meal free coupon all for myself. I ordered a barbeque chicken burger and the honey sesame cihcken. The honey sesame chicken was really good compared to other ameracanized fast-food chinese places on the ave and the burger was done well, with bacon and onion rings, although the chicken they used seemed an odd choice for a burger. As other reviewers have mentioned, the prices are a bit steep compared to other ave joints, but hey, I had a coupon. And I have more, so I'll probably be trying some of their korean food soon. Food is good and service is friendly. Try the Rock N' Roll burger wow the fries here are absolutely delicious! They're hand cut and fried to perfection. I also love how they have such a big variety of vegetarian options for their burgers.Their burgers are absolutely delicious! (try the Cali burger!) This place was worth every penny!
Amante is great for delivery great price you get good sized portions they don't skimp on toppings and I really like their quality ingredients. I'm impressed by how fresh their salads are. &#160;I give them 5 stars because every night I dread the kitchen and want something fresh I can count on amante and get a good meal for about 25-30 bucks and still have plenty leftover! Plus their service is great. The people who take my order are friendly and fast and I have never waited longer than 30-40 minutes for my order. The delivery staff is very friendly too! Chicken Pesto pizza with goat cheese. Best pizza there IS, plus they deliver. :D Food is pretty good. Really bad customer service and silly delivery policy. Pesto Chicken pasta is tasty. Pizza is very meh... soggy crust, cheap ingredients.I used to order from them a couple of times a week. The last time I tried to order my total came to 14.73, they said they would not deliver because it was under 15.... I asked if they could just charge me 15, like they have done before and they refused. I told them I order a couple of times a week and they said too bad. Never again.
Saigon Deli is one of 3 edible places in the international district in my opinion (the others being gourmet noodle bowl and ambrosia).I never have to deal with parking when i'm hear because the turn around time is so quick. Sandwiches are delicious and fast, though i'm pretty sure they spread a good chunk of lard on them. It's not mayo for sure because the fat is solid and clear. However, you have to eat with it because the healthy version isn't the same!The bf really likes their rice combos and they are generous with portion. 1 combo usually lasts 2 meals. The food is greasy though, so just be aware. They have pretty good fish dishes and mushroom chicken.I also like their taro tapioca dessert, which I will indulge myself once in a while. You really can't go wrong with anything here, its cheap and awesome.The best part? The prices include tax! This place is located in the heart of china town. Me &amp; a co-worker go here alot for the "lunch box" that they serve during the lunch hours. It is rice &amp; two entrees to choose from. It fills you up.The service is fast. In &amp; out usually within 5 minutes. Can't ask for more than a hot, solid, dependable lunch joint!!Try it out. Saigon Deli is my favorite place in Seattle for a BBQ pork banh mi - said to be one of the best in America. Reasons to go: 1. There's parking. 2. They're only $2.75!3. The rolls they use are bomb. 4. The banh mi is filled with lots of fresh and pickled veggies and juicy meat. I just got really hungry writing this review. I'm going to stop now. As a newly minted vegan, I've gone heavily into eating tofu bahn mi and pretty much sampled every such offering in Seattle's Little Saigon (the area around 12th and Jackson).Believe me, this place blows all of its local competitors utterly away. &#160;The distance between Saigon Deli and the rest of them deserves to be some kind of business school case study.How they do it, of course, is no great mystery. &#160;As some earlier reviews have mentioned, the place has a parking lot that accommodates its patronage, they use great tasting baguettes and the freshest ingredients, and their pricing is the lowest around. So, really, if you want to frequent a bahn mi place that gets it consistently right--and for only $2.50 or so--this is it! I feel like there is always competition at this intersection for who serves the best Banh mi. &#160;I only try the vegetarian tofu one at every place, and I feel like Saigon deli serves up my least favorite one, and the prices of all the other things in the restaurant are generally higher than at the other deli's in the neighborhood. &#160;Saying least favorite doesn't mean it's bad - it's still a delicious baguette filled with pickled carrots and daikon, jalapenos, cilantro, and tofu. &#160;I just don't think the tofu is as well marinated here, and the bread isn't consistent. &#160;Sometimes it can be really crunchy, and other times it can be too soft. &#160;Maybe this place gets more stars for the meat options. There is something about this place that keeps people coming back. It's not the plethora of food and smells that hit you once you step inside, or the limited amount of parking space (on every given weekend), or even the nondescript pricing on their package products (although no one really cares). I think people come here for the cheap eats and the Vietnamese coffee that is a staple for any Asian who orders a banh mi after a long Sunday morning sitting in church. This place is the definition of a deli: a place where you grab a quick bite with minimal advertising. The only advertising they need is the food displayed right in front of you. The price and quality is fair, and what you see is what you get. Open early and closes late, Saigon Deli offers a quick bite without breaking your bank. #1 grilled pork and pennywort beverage. Healthy and refreshing.Best Vietnamese sandwich in town (in my opinion). &#160;Their egg rolls are pretty tasty too. &#160;Their hot lunch "boxes" are pretty cheap for the amount you get. Here is an idea: stop going to Seattle Deli located nearby. Seattle Deli has a horrible parking situation and their sandwiches aren't touching Saigon Deli's. Saigon Deli has its own parking lot - this is SO convenient. They have a great variety of Vietnamese deli food and the best Vietnamese sandwiches in town. The sandwiches are fresh and very affordable. This is my go to place for a quick lunch. Go now. This place is the shit. They have a ton of variety of your favorite Vietnamese foods on-the-go, and it's quality food. I've never bought anything that I thought was anything less than what I expected. They have fresh spring rolls and deep-fried egg rolls to go, vermicelli to go, sandwiches, sesame balls, sticky rice desserts, coconut desserts. They offer it at competitive prices. What else do you need? Nothing. I could live in their parking lot that is filled with pigeons' poop and trash. Because I can. Seriously, just pack your bags and go. Don't look back, and don't think twice. Veggies get a #5 sandwich. Delicious! Fair warning, the spices hit me about halfway through the sandwich. It was seriously spicy. I'm kind of a spice wimp, but this was lip-numbing for me. The line and atmosphere can be a bit chaotic, but the banh mi are so freaking good that I don't care. I love both the BBQ pork #1 and the tofu #5, for $3 and $2.50 respectively. Drool ...Droooool ...Droooooooooool ...^ That is what happens every time I get a sandwich from this place, from the second I walk in, order, and then chomp down on that beautifully delicious piece of work because I CAN. NOT. WAIT. to eat that thing. It's just so good! I remember the first time I had their sandwiches, I was volunteering. It had been about two or three hours since we picked them up, and yet... SO. FREAKIN. GOOD. Imagine when I had one fresh!I usually get chicken, but when I have the time to just sit down at a bus stop or something and enjoy their sandwiches, I love going tofu. Even their tofu banh mi is good, man! I used to laugh at people that had to eat their sandies without meat. Now I'm one of them.And it's fast. And cheap. Cheap, cheap, cheap. Granted, you can get'em cheaper elsewhere, but will they taste this good? This fresh? Be this toasted!? Hell, no.And after not having had a Vietnamese sandwich all year because I've been away at college... I experienced the rainbows all over again today. Ahh. Yum. Ah, this place is amazing! &#160;The bahn mi is great! &#160;There's not much more to say other than that. &#160;Just go there for the bbq pork bahn mi! Whenever I go on a trip somewhere on a plane. I usually take a banh mi with me on the place. Yum! &#160;I recently went to orlando for a business trip and I was extremely disappointed in myself. How can I leave without take banh mi with me on the road?! In result, I had mediocre chinese food and decent japanese food in orlando. definitely hard to find asian food there!the sandwiches are a definite must at this place because of how cheap it is. I also love the desserts that they make fresh! If you want a cheap eat, go to international district and get lunch! Or if you're like me.... I usually buy 3-4 so it will last me a day.... maybe a day unless i eat all four for breakfast and lunch. Best VN sandwiches in Seattle period. This is the only place in Seattle where I would get my banh mi. It has been many many years, I thought I should give the credit it deserves. My favorite is banh mi cha (not on the menu, but you can ask) - pretty much the special banh mi with ONLY the pork ham slices, pate and veggie condiments. I also like the shredded pork, BBQ pork and tofu. Chicken is the only one I'm not too fond of, but my friends love it.Occasionally I would get their food for to go. They look delicious on the hot tray, and they are also very tasty. I've recently become addicted to their desserts (hot and cold). &#160;Really, I have not been disappointed with anything I tried here!! WOW, just WOW. I got the No 1. which was pork and lightly topped but for $3, are you kidding me! I prormised myself to only eat half as it's a good 8" white roll, but that didn't happen. Everything was perfect, the crunch pickled vegetables the jalape&#241;o, cilantro. The pork was zoo flavorful and the spread mayo? Aiole? It was perfect! The best vietnamese bahn mi Seattle has to offer. Come here for the sandwiches. and stay here for the sandwiches Seattle's best Banh Mi, hands down. Do not mix up the names and end up at "New Saigon Deli" or "Saigon Vietnam Deli"(since they are all so close to each other). The special ham sandwiches and the bbq pork sandwiches are good but combined with the crusty baguette they are a tad too dry for me so my vote goes to the chicken banh mi. Or better still, just get one of each. I love this place. My boyfriend eats the hot food but I have to get a bbq pork sandwich and egg rolls. We always get four - 2 each. I've eaten egg rolls everywhere but this place has the best egg rolls i've ever had. No lie. I believe they're veggie egg rolls too and I'm a big meat eater...,WOW! hmm, I am vietnamese. That being said, I have pretty high standard for vnese food.I usually take the bus here so parking was not a problem at all.My fav are the Special Ham sandwiches and the Barbeque ones. For three-buck sandwiches they are surprisingly generous with the amount of meat in each serving.They are always good, that I usually get at least 3 sandwiches.For those who fear of exesscive fat on the meat, no worry, I think the fat were just right, and the meat doesn't seem too cheap at all (okay quality, I would say) the best bahn mi in seattle!other great goodies at awesome prices... Just tried this place, and it's amazing. &#160;The hype is not undeserved. &#160;My friend and I plowed through 3 sandwiches each the other day. &#160;I can't stop thinking about this place, I must go back asap. For years, I've always gone with the chicken banh mi - always thinking that I could muster the strength to choose another banh mi, After all, the chicken was spectacular, so the other types would be incredible, too, right? But I just couldn't do it. The chicken banh mi is so delicious, crunchy baguette, crispy veggies, spicy and cool all at the same time. A perfect blend of flavor.But just the other day, someone brought me a '3 types of pork' banh mi. OMG-- it's just as terrific as the chicken. Maybe even better, cuz it was the one in my hand at that moment.If you haven't tried a banh mi from Saigon Deli, you are missing out! Yummy! the vietnamese subs are so good here. The ingredients taste extremely fresh. They make the sub so fast maybe less then 2mins? Based on the reviews, we dropped by Saturday morning to grab some food for brunch. &#160;This is not a restaurant. &#160;It is food to go. &#160;Since the place doesn't have a menu, it would be hard for me to list what we ordered. &#160;Most items are prepacked to go. &#160;The sandwiches are made to order. &#160;The special ham sandwich was excellent. &#160;Other Vietnamese stores/deli will call it differently, even in other cities as well. &#160;There are three different types of pork in this sandwich. &#160;One of the pork is generally the belly cut. &#160;You either like it or you don't. &#160;The bread was fresh which is an important requirement for this sandwich. &#160;It is a typical Vietnamese sandwich with some slightly variation from place to place. &#160;Other fluent speaking Vietnamese may do &#160;a better job describing this sandwich than me.Looking around the place, the portion of every item is very good. &#160;Another typical Vietnamese deli item is a white bun with a meat mixture inside. &#160;It is typically wrapped in plastic sitting on the shelf. &#160;At this place, it is sitting inside a steamer. &#160;Though I didn't eat one here. I am very impressed with the steamer, keeping it moist and warm obviously. &#160;I have never seen this any where. &#160;The Cha Gio (aka egg roll) portion is large. &#160;My sons ate two pieces within a couple of minutes. &#160;My other son devoured the three pork meatballs on a stick. &#160;It must have been good. &#160;My sons are only 8 and 10. &#160;They do not like well done meat (steak, chicken, pork, or fish). &#160;They eat tuna sashimi and smoked salmon. &#160;They love most fruits and decent variety of veggies. &#160;They have a pretty good taste in food. They are exposed to a variety of cuisine. &#160;So when they ate food in this place like they did, I would have to say that it is pretty good. We ordered a few other items which were very good as well. &#160;I know that it is not much of a description. &#160;On the other hand, I don't like che, which is a dessert. &#160;It comes in a variety like American pie. &#160;It is typically a thick liquid and obviously sweet. &#160;But that is just my personal preference. &#160;I would not know how it tastes here.It is too bad that today is our last day in Seattle. &#160;We would have loved to come back to enjoy other items.
Things I tried at Mee Sum:- Black sesame hot tea (sans bubbles)My companion thought this was pretty intense and odd, but I was fond of it.- Ma po tofu ($6.50)Despite having a spice indicator next to it on the menu, I found this to be very bland and nearly flavorless. It had baby corn, celery, wobbly soft tofu and a hint of garlic. It came with a free soup which was hot &amp; sour and the employee said the soup was vegetarian. The soup was pretty good.- Taro bubble teaI tried a sip of this and thought it was okay, though I wouldn't go out of my way for it.....Atmosphere: Lots of young asian college students, TV blasting PBS, radio blasting questionable pop music / poppy hip-hop, manga and board games. I was there to do work, and there were sufficient outlets &amp; tables for that purpose. This is a nice place to hangout and chill with some friends if you have nothing better to do in the University District. They have a pretty big LCD tv where they air sports shows or even asian music videos along with some cozy sofas and small dinner tables for you to eat or study. They offer bubble tea and a dinner menu that I can appreciate not to mention a tasty pastry case offered at a relatively cheap price. The red bean bubble tea (hot) is one of my favorites.I guess the only thing I can complain about is that sometimes their dinner menu food is served like it has been stored in the fridge and microwaved for the customer. A couple of times my food came out a barely warm and it really made me question how the prepared it. Mee Sum is a surprisingly large caf&#233;; plenty of room for underage kids to hang out while getting high off of syrupy sweet "teas". &#160;Reminds me of cafes in Rowland Heights, California. &#160;Too bad the drinks didn't measure up. &#160;I ordered a lychee tea with lychee boba and hubs ordered an iced mocha with original boba. &#160;Total was $6.10 for two ~12 ounce drinks, a pretty good deal in my book. &#160;Note, they don't accept American Express but they do except Visa or Mastercard. &#160;The Good: &#160;Boba was perfectly cooked. &#160;Sometimes it can get too hard or too soft, spoiling the whole drink. &#160;Mee Sum's boba was just right.The Bad: &#160;Unfortunately both drinks were too sweet. &#160;I wanted to rip off the plastic cover and add a cup of water. &#160;I didn't finish my drink but hubs did and seemed to enjoy it. &#160;Maybe it's just me... Mee Sum is okay. I get their hom bow as a quick snack sometimes, and I like the atmosphere and fat stack of Chinese fashion magazines they have. However, I got some takeout food yesterday (Fried octopus meal with veggies, rice, and egg flower soup) and it was pretty bad. The egg flower soup had NO TASTE AT ALL. NOTHING. It was like I was eating snot water. The bok choy was tasteless as well, and the fried octopus was greasy and a bit cold. Yucky. I've had their bubble tea on one occasion and it was wayyyyy too sweet. Granted, I'm not a huge fan of bubble tea, but it was pretty unpleasant. Looks like I'll be sticking to hom bow from now on. i usually go there for the ice blackmilktea but i felt like eating chinese food so i ordered a mealit came with the Meesum soup but i've never like the taste of it so i usually throw it away. but when i was just mixiing it around i found a egg shell inside..and as a past waitress, i know soups are made in a big pot and just kept warm.. so that &#160;other part of the eggshell could be in someone else's soup .Just watch out what you eat i guess . This place use to be call Jasmin tea, then gossip,, then I guess it' s now called Mee Sum: I quite don't understand why people are reviewing a boba place when they are not a fan of boba. I just find a little amusing. &#160;Kinda defeats the purpose of it. &#160; Not a hospital that you HAVE to go... lol I regress.. &#160; &#160;ok back to the point... &#160;The only thing that would make me smile bigger as I write this review is.. IF I was at MEE SUM Pastry right now having a bubble TEA!!! &#160; B/c I'm starving right now and have some computer work to do (- yelping of course)  &#160; &#160;Here's the low down... I used to come here everyday, have a bubble tea and study for my MCATS... &#160; &#160;FACT: I never grew tired of it &#160; &#160;FACT: I had good metabolism back then so... I didn't grow love handles until 1 month out... &#160;(FACT if I did that right now..it'll take may be one half the time) &#160; &#160;FACT: They have plenty variety of things to in the other than tapica (to include pudding... various fruit jelly)  &#160; &#160;FACT: They use real tea and have a pantry with kick ass food... YUM... i'm hungry thinking about it &#160; &#160;FACT: I would recommend HK style if you were thinking about "thai tea"  &#160; &#160;FACT: IT's on the AVe so you'll see alot of people studying there... &#160; &#160; &#160;FACT: IF you don't like bubble tea... don't go to a bubble tea and complain about bubble tea...  &#160; I THINK: they had wifi... i haven't used it there.
El malecon is one of the few places that serves decent food at a low price. Always open for lunch, lots of servers, nice people, never get my order wrong. It's a place I continually return to on a regular basis for lunch. Prices go up for dinner. If you're looking for Tex mex or nuveau Mexican food, this isn't for you. If you're looking for a place way better than azteca, here you go. I should say right away that the service here is pretty great. &#160;Nice, attentive people every time I've been.But dang, I've had both of their meatless burritos now and they were both really boring. &#160;I'm not even sure how they do it, veggie burritos shouldn't be that challenging a feat to accomplish. &#160;It's like somehow in the cooking process they suck the life out of all the ingredients. &#160;The rice is bland, the tortilla is mushy, and if I hadn't noticed that the thing I was putting into my mouth was round and orange I wouldn't have known it was a carrot. &#160;It's like the whole burrito is muted. &#160;It's like I'm eating with a tongue wrapped in plastic.The chips are pretty good though. &#160;I don't know what happened when Andee D. was there.
Eek. &#160;The two stars are for friendly, attentive service - we tipped well. &#160;The food was gluey gawdawfulness, and it deserved no stars at all. &#160;Seriously, how do you eff up pasta this badly? &#160;Expensive, too, for what you get. &#160;This is Spaghetti Night at your sister-in-law's, but worse and you get to pay for it.
This is a great place for my family. The wait staff is the nicest group of people. They are especially friendly to my son, who tends to roam a bit. Booths and tables are large which I like, and the chips and salsa alone are worth the trip.If you're picky, even a bit, this won't be at the top of your list. But my wife and I split a tasty $13 combo plate and can't finish it and my son eats for 1&#162; on Sunday. It could definitely use some carpet cleaning and a scrub down. But I'd say it's worth a try. I have tried Puerto Vallarta twice now over a span of several years and nothing much has changed. VERY slow service although they are nice people the speed is just ridiculous. We also thought it was spendee. $60 for a family of 4 with no appetizers, desserts, beer or wine and two meals were kids. The establishment itself is not high end so be casual. The food however is pretty decent and there is a lot of options on the menu including American. Also the portions are huge soooo maybe consider buying a meal and splitting it. So if you want to "hang out" and have some decent food try it out but try to get the coupon they run regularly in a mailer/val pak thing. &#160; It will save you 50% off one meal.
Mmm. mmmmm. start with the creme caramel. Just reserve a portion and make sure you dine with that finale in mind. I have enjoyed every meal I've ever eaten here. Start with a fresh roasted beet salad with gorgonzola balsamic, so yummy. At one time, it was probably cutting edge fare in its way. No longer, but who cares? Yesterday's cutting edge is today's comfort, and there's nothing tastier to me than the Queen City roasted range free chicken. If you're in a cozy mood, I don't think you can make a mistake here.About the booths. These are the very best booths anywhere. Mirror polished dark wood, super tall dividers, deep, and lush in an unpadded way. You can hide out in these booths. You can just disappear. You can just recline and dig the scene whilst sipping a glass of pinot noir.I don't know. I know it's been around a while and it's not all that exciting. But there's always a warm hum of activity, the bar is packed with a mostly 30-40something crowd, turned out for a good time. On a recent visit, from our nook, &#160;B. and I watched a sort-of attractive couple (and they thought they were smokin which made the watching exceptional) that practically undressed each other right there on their perches. It was great. We were, like, is that for real? You can't pay for entertainment that good. And certainly not while spooning up rich, dense, tasty creme caramel.
this is truly a neighborhood pub. &#160;a place where you can mingle with honest hard working americans and strike up a conversation with a stranger. &#160;there are a couple pool tables and a decent selection of light beer.i wouldn't take a date here but its a great place to take a friend for conversation. I've been coming to the Quarter Lounge since the day it opened and I love it. &#160;Low key, the bartenders are awesome, the drinks cheap. &#160;The atmosphere can get kinda loud later in the evening, but for happy hour this place is the best, most of the patrons know each other and are quick to welcome any newbies to the bar, the jukebox is an online juke so you can hear whatever your heart desires. &#160;Only sad part is that the rear smoking deck was shuttered.
Okay first off I gotta say they really need make their free parking much more visible because I always end up paying at the meters. Today was great got a seat right away and got food literally two minutes after I sat down. Usually there is a line out the door so i recommend getting there early or late lunch times. Especially in the summer. Food was very tasty and the tortilla chips come with three different salsa which are all good. One warning the habenero sauce on the table is EXTRA CALLIENTE!!!! only a few drips will do. The other people I was with lined their tortillas with the sauce and literally had tears coming out their eyes.....also in the summer its a great place to kayak before or after lunch..but its shut down right now cause they're fixing the marina. Note: I'm focusing on the restaurant here as I've never done the kayak rentals.I've been coming here, albeit infrequently, for almost 4 years and it rarely disappoints. It's definitely not the best Mexican food in the world, and Casa D's has better burritos, but the food is on the better side of average, and it's great with friends or a date (you will generally have plenty of time to talk, the last time I was here I had to wait 30 minutes on a Tuesday at 7:30pm for 2 and the weather wasn't even nice out) and delicious margaritas which would make a great start to a U District pub crawl. The basket of chips ($2.50) to start is huge and worth it when accompanied with the three salsa choices on the bar which includes a salsa verde mild enough for the spice averse.I most often will order the mangodilla appetizer ($7 for a whole) (quesadilla with mango) and add chicken or pork ($3) and make it an entree. It's about double what I can eat, especially after the chips, so I take the rest with me for dinner the next day.One warning is that they can get super busy, rivaling the line I've experienced at La Carta de Oaxaca - the worst time is probably late Spring, when the weather is nice out but UW is still in session.On second thought, nevermind. Agua Verde is terrible, don't go there so it's easier for me to get a table... When I crave a fish taco this is where I go. &#160;I'm pretty much stuck on the Bagre (catfish) or &#160;Bacalao (fried cod). DELISH!Its also great to go kayaking in the spring/summer from the paddle club below than grab some food afterwards. I like Agua Verde alot. &#160;I wish I could love it and sometimes I do. &#160;The food is really good here, as for freshness and quality I can't be so sure. &#160;I have on occasion left here feeling not so good. &#160;But somehow, I always end up going back. &#160;The view on a summer day from the deck is amazing. &#160;Enjoying the water, the sun, the margaritas. &#160;The mango-rita is my favorite and the limeade is delicious. &#160;I always get guacamole and usually the fish tacos (previously halibut and now mahi mahi on the menu). &#160;You get three very filling fish tacos, not deep fried, with creamy avocado sauce and cabbage. &#160;The rice is o.k. and the black beans traditional and not refried, which I love. &#160;The yam tacos are also delicious. &#160;Very filling and slightly sweet and creamy. Now I don't generally like potatoes, but the chile mashed potatoes here might be one of my favorite things. &#160;I don't know what is in there, but they are really flavorful, creamy and a little bit spicy and I could eat them everyday. &#160;Go hungry because you always leave stuffed. Awesome location, great view, good food. Had the pork tamale tamale with rice and beans. Filling and excellent flavor. Definitely plan to go back and hopefully avoid the crowds. I love Agua Verde! For lunch you stand in line, order, and then seat yourself. You'll also be expected to bus your own table most of the time. The deck is the best place to sit, with its view of Lake Union. In the winter it's glassed in and heated, too, which is nice. Try the tacos rather than a burrito or one of their sandwiches, and you'll be happy. The carnitas tacos come with corn tortillas, lots of pork and cabbage, and chips on the side. For 2 more dollars you also get rice and beans - choice of black or pinto. Top 'em off with the diablito salsa and they're delicious. Fish tacos here are also excellent. Margaritas are good, but in my experience not especially strong. I'm usually okay with that because I'm there for lunch. Because they rely so much on the student population, their hours can be kind of wacky during breaks. This year they were randomly closed a couple of times when I stopped by, and then they officially closed from December 15th to the beginning of January. It's a good idea to call ahead during breaks/ holidays.ETA: As of March 2008, Agua Verde has changed their carnitas recipe. It's now drowned in some sort of sweet-ish barbecue sauce. This is NOT a good thing; it's practically inedible. I had to dock them a star for changing something great into something totally mediocre. We had lunch with the kiddies here yesterday for the first time. I have to say I liked it alot. It was fairly empty at 11:30, so we got the pink room in the back to ourselves so not to offend the other patrons with our rambunctious 3 and 1 year olds. Hubby ordered the bacalao tacos, which were MUCH better than my carnitas tacos. The carnitas tacos were just okay, pretty dry in my opinion. The kiddos got the quesadillas and loved them. We will go back, and I will order the bacalao next time.
Oh man, this place is awesome. The food is so fresh and delicious and the staff are super nice. They have a cool fireplace thingy too. Last time I had the beef special which was beef in about a dozen different ways. All of them great! LOVE THIS PLACE!My girlfriend and I ordered 3 appetizers, 2 drinks, 3 main courses, and dessert for 60 bucks!! The food is fresh, the enviorment is cozy and sophisticated, the service is awesome, and the menu is huge! This is a great place to impress a girl and for a really reasonable price!Be careful though, the weekends get super busy! Expect 45 min wait or longer if you don't have reservations. Either call it Vietnamese food made for Americans, or Asian fusion. &#160;Food is exotic if you're not familiar with Asian food. &#160;Overall, not bad, cept some of the dishes were overcooked. &#160;Service was amateurish. &#160;Really, I can't figure out what the big deal is about this place. Tamarind Tree is one of those places that you might expect to be a "best kept secret" of the International District, because it sits well hidden back in a corner behind a crowded mini mall. But apparently, all of Seattle knows about this place - because even with a lobby crowded to capacity, a fresh lot of new patrons arrived every minute or two to push their way through the crowd and check out the wait list.We had a large double-birthday party with 18 people and reservations at 6, but didn't get seated until 6:20 - which was pretty annoying, especially with the lobby being so stuffed. But once we sat down, we had delicious food in front of us immediately. The restaurant had suggested that we order in advance due to our large numbers, and Miss Stephanie P (see fellow Yelper) took it upon herself to organize accordingly. The Shiitake mushroom satay, grilled chicken rolls, fresh pineapple &amp; mango salads, and the grilled lemongrass prawns in particular were fantastic! I went here last night in search of a good bowl of spicy soup to kick the cold outta my system. Gotta love Seattle - been here a month and have had 2 colds already. Alright, I'm a California wimp... what can I say? I will say that Tamarind Tree did right by me!The place doesn't look like much from the outside, stuck into the corner of a strip mall in the Int'l District. Once inside though, it's a pretty warm and inviting space. Ours was even warmer as we were seated next to the fire - cozy!! I ordered the Hue spicy noodles - Large round rice noodle in spicy broth with beef and pork slices, shrimp patty, and house meatball slices served with fresh bean sprouts, shredded morning glory, and banana blossoms. JUST WHAT THE DOC ORDERED! Can't wait to go back for another good meal to try something new. The menu is BIG! I'd put this place in more of the 'fusion' category than in the 'authentic Vietnamese' category. &#160;And it does the Vietnamese/fusion thing quite well. &#160;It stays well within the Vietnamese base (even keeping the French colonial additions), but adds the thick chopsticks, dark lighting, square plates, etc. along with the slightly sweeter seasonings, and some non-traditional ingredients that mark your typical fusion additions. &#160;But, even though I don't think okra is traditional Vietnamese, it was still markedly traditional.Agree with Andrea J: plenty of vegetarian options, although they do mix &amp; match some of the vegetarian elements in getting a wider array of dishes. &#160;For example, I ordered the vegetarian Tamarind Tree noodles, and got the same style mushroom satay and tofu satay that I just ate. 7 Course Beef!I visited this place for lunch. &#160;According to the person who took me, this place is really beautiful at night. &#160;It's sort of hidden in a random shopping center on the corner of 12th and Jackson. &#160;Don't let the exterior fool you, the inside is beautiful and the service is great.The food was amazing. &#160;I shared the 7 Course Beef with a coworker. &#160;It was easily one of the best lunches I have had while working downtown. &#160;I'm not Vietnamese so I can't tell you how authentic this place is but based on the fact that there were a ton of Vietnamese people eating there I guess it can't be that far off. :) I guess I'm going to say what everyone else is going to say about The Tamarind Tree. It's Vietnamese food made for Americans. It's located in the International District in the midst of the gritty and smelly markets where some sophisticated types might be too scared to venture to, but the fact that you're going to a Vietnamese restaurant in that part of town suddenly validates a "cultural experience" for many, when it's anything but that.I must admit it's kind of a nice surprise going into a shitty looking building and entering a beautiful well lit restaurant. You don't expect it at all. The Tamarind Tree is decorated to perfection. The fire pits, the lighting, the color scheme, the bamboo accents, etc. It's so pretty in the restaurant that you forget whether the food is that good or not.I ordered a few things when I went there. I had the Tamarind Tree Crepe, Lemongrass chicken, and the Tamaraind Tree Noodle. That's a lot of food. When the food came out the firs thing they brought out was an excessive amount of leafy greens from lettuce, basil, etc. I understand it's part of the meal, but it seriously took up all the space on the table and it was too distracting. I think it would be in the best interest of the restaurant and in the best interest of the guests if the leafy greens were cut down in portions, but more is available upon request. So now that I have got that minor annoyance out of the way let me describe the food.The food was good, but I've had better. (Ahem: The Lemongrass only a couple blocks down the street, cheaper, and the same clean and classy interior, but more casual). They set it up to make customers feel like they are truly gaining a cultural experience by making them assemble their rolls themselves, dipping the wraps in warm water and stuffing it with however much of the contents needed to fulfill your appetite. Sure it's nice and it makes people feel good about themselves, but seriously...if you want better Vietnamese food and can live with a more casual setting without the glitz and ooohs and aaahs of a pretty hole in the wall spot in the shitty part of town...then go to Lemongrass. Give me a break, this place is terrific!This food is not only delicious but it's really satisfying too. I don't know if it's officially "healthy", but I always feel like I've eaten something wholesome and good when I'm done (but maybe that's just because it's not slathered in cheese like most of my meals). Best of all though, it feels like a some kind of secret - all tucked away back in the corner of a shopping strip that gives no indication of what greatness lies hidden in its midst. But it's really no secret to anyone that has been there that this is one of the best restaurants in town. Go, go! Love this place. &#160;I tried twice before to eat here but the wait list was so long on a Friday night that we ended up going somewhere else. At least I knew it was a popular place. Finally ate here on a Wednesday night with a few out of town friends. This is a great place for a small group. Delicious vietnamese food offerings, including familiar Pho for the uninitiated. &#160;It's a little tucked away, but our "new to seattle" friend were able to find it, but I tend to give detailed directions. I'm covered in fish sauce.If I had been able to become covered in fish sauce a little faster, there would be some red stars sitting up there.Central Broken Rice. Purple Mint? Wowza. People love this place with good reason, me being one of these people. &#160;Everything about this place makes your dining experience well worth the adventure of trying to actually find it. &#160;Tucked back in the corner of a strip mall in the International District, don't be surprised if you drive by a few times before you actually locate it.The drinks, the food, the ambiance, the wait staff, all fantastic. &#160;My only gripe would be that I felt rushed the entire meal. &#160;I understand they are busy and need to turn over tables as quickly as possible to keep the masses waiting by the door happy, but "Damn, I haven't finished eating that beef salad yet, dude!"On the plus side of them rushing us through dinner, I didn't have time to realize that I was full, so I was able to stuff my face and not feel it until after I left. &#160;Well played, sir. This is the second time I have gone and I gotta say that the food did not disappoint. Its pretty interesting how nice this place looks inside considering where the location is. It is a complete remodel of the Little bit of Saigon location and looks nothing like it used to. I had the Bun Bo Hue(noodle soup from Hue) &#160;this time and I gotta say that there hasn't been too many places that I have enjoyed it but they made it very good. Their rice dishes also are very good as well. I would recommend calling ahead or going online to get a reservation cause they get pretty packed at lunch and from what I hear in the evening as well. so this is a place i'd love to take my friends....that weren't vietnamese ;Pthey have a huge menu (great for any vegetarians also), they have extremely cute decor (next time i wanna sit outside where the waterfall is), the service is usually pretty good, and the food is good. the prices are a buck or two more than other vietnamese restaurants but hey -you're paying for the decor. but it ain't no green leaf! ;D Yum! This is the best Vietnamese restaurant I have ever been to! (OK, it's one of the few Vietnamese restaurants I have ever been to.) We decided to do a double birthday celebration here and ended up with a group of 18. As the organizer I was faced with the dubious task of pre-ordering for the group. Luckily, Tam and Troy saved my ass by suggesting a menu. The minute we sat down food began arriving. All of the selections were amazing. My faves were the shitake mushroom satay and the tumeric coconut rice cakes and the green beans and tofu. Everyone was completely stuffed. And our food bill was rather reasonable for all the food we had. This is one of my favorite Vietnamese places. At times there is a wait so I suggest reservations. My recommendation is the Banh Coun Dac Biet. &#160;There bun dishes are ok. This place offers a wide variety of Vietnamese dishes. I like how they are not caught up too much in asian fushion and focus on traditional Vietnamese dishes. A must try if your in the mood for Vietnamese. Delicious. I am split over the rating on this one... I think 3.5 really. Tamarind Tree seems to be the trendy spot right now for the "in" crowd to feel like they have found a diamond in the rough. And by rough I mean overflowing dumpsters and shady characters in dumpy markets. The ambiance is nice and the service was quick. Unfortunately if felt kind of like they wanted us to eat fast and get out. Especially since they told us there would be an extra charge if we stayed over two hours when we made reservations. Drink menu is mostly a variety of fruity cocktails, seriously lacking on sake and beer. The menu is vast, and the prices reasonable, I don't know enough about Vietnamese food to know if its authentic or not. One thing that severely annoyed me, besides the hurry up attitude, was the way the waiter felt the need to deliver instructions with my meal. I am pretty sure I can figure out what to do with a bowl of water and a plate of dried rice paper. Now if I was slurping the water out of the bowl like a dog and munching the rice paper like crackers I would expect some guidance, but just assuming that your customer is clueless is not exactly polite. The other negative thing was the fact that the waiter was in such a hurry to run off with our appertizer orders he didn't hear/forgot one of the items we ordered. I ordered a noodle platter, which I recommend you avoid. It was half a plate of greenery and I wasn't that thrilled trying to roll a bunch of crap together. That was my fault for ordering it though. Overall solidly middle of the road. to find a trendy spot in the middle of the international district seemed odd to me, but tamarind tree was just that. now, maybe "trendy" is a little bit much, but relative to the rest of the district, this place is pretty nice.for asian food, one of my guages for quality is how many natives are eating at the restaurant. tamarind tree, however, draws people from all walks of life. this is not because it sold its soul and "americanized" their menu, but moreso because their food is just plain good. having been to southeast asia, i recognize many of the dishes on their menu. the quality is good and there is tremendous variety.i eat out a LOT. i live in hotels and i have to eat out pretty much every night. after a while, i have gotten somewhat unaware of prices. so when my friend and i went here the first time, we looked at the menu and just assumed that everything was probably "tapas-style" because it was all so cheap! imagine our surprise when our dishes started coming out and they were full blown meals!!! it was quite comical, but oh so good! there is nothing too outrageous on the menu, so bringing my less adventurous friends tends to be a safe proposition. for dessert, the four seasons steamed cakes are delicious!i have been back multiple times and have never been disappointed. you should try this place. Tamarind Tree always welcomes me with good food and service. I am addicted to this place! So tasty! I've never had a bad meal here. It's cute inside, and has a nice deck outside. The location is at first confusing to find, but definitely worth the trip. I've taken my kids here twice for lunch on a Saturday. &#160;The kids (10&amp;12) did great, tried new things, and enjoyed most everything. &#160;The staff were quite welcoming to the kids and mine weren't the only ones there. &#160;I feel like we've just scratched the surface of the menu, so many things to try! &#160;The meatball satay is terrific, the sauce is a not-so-typical peanut sauce. &#160;Mmmm. &#160;I could do without the okra satay, next time we'll try the eggplant. &#160;Can't wait to go again. &#160;Even with the parking issues.
I've never had the food so I can't vouch for that but you can't argue with the beer. Plenty of bar games and I've never had too much of a problem getting a table. It is a college bar so expect that crowd. If you are planning on seeing a show next door at Giggles stop here for drinks first and after. So many good memories of hanging out with friends at this place.
4.5 Stars. Listen up folks: the woman that runs this place is from Guangdong Province. Don't know where that is? Google it. It ain't anywhere near Puyallup. She didn't intern at McDonalds. Know before you go! &#160;They make awesome BBQ duck and pork. Authentic Chinese BBQ. It's what they do, it's who they are, it's their raison d'&#234;tre. Soup, rice, veggies, and choice of 2 meats for around $6. Really, really, good. Addictive in fact. It's a dive, not a date place. Don't go here on your 25th wedding anniversary. Don't go here looking for a bacon cheeseburger &amp; a Miller Lite. But, go here any other time, and go here often. If you've never experienced "duck love", this is the alpha &amp; omega. Oh yeah...and the dumplings/pot stickers/jiao zi are terrific This is a hole in the wall kind of restaurant, but they have the best BBQ. My favorite is the roast pork which has the crispy skin and layer of fat and meat beneath......so yummy! Roasted duck is my next favoritevermont the skin which roasted to perfection. Soy sauce and salty chicken are both good too. Very good portion to get the BBQ any kind and any combination with rice. Didn't get the chance to try other menu items yet.
The Innkeeper looks much the same as Marco's Supperclub, but manages to have both a little more personality and a little less attitude. &#160;The menu is focused on Latin American and Caribbean dishes, with a few good cocktails to boot. &#160;I had the Penn Cove Manila Clams and Chorizo, which were spicy and tasty and had me ordering extra bread to sop up every drop of the broth. &#160;I also had a cup of the Ham Hock White Bean soup which was also very fine.The cocktails were fairly good, though not quite as well balanced as one would expect at, say, Spur or Canon. &#160;I had a fairly good "Fleur de Lys" and an okay Corn n'Oil, while my friend had a slightly sweet but enjoyable Dark and Stormy.The Innkeeper is run by the folks behind Black Bottle and here they provide the same sort of affordable, quality food in perhaps a slightly more casual atmosphere. &#160;I'm eager to go back, particularly if the back patio is open on warm evenings. Agreed on the lighting way too dark (and my server did ,too and graciously turned the dimmer up a bit so I could read the menu and my New Yorker). &#160;Super nice srvice, good food and value - loved my Cuban pulled-pork sandwich w/Ceasar salad &amp; Chuckanut draft beer. &#160;Will be going w/a bunch of friends soon and w/try more off the menu and hope they have improved the lighting so I can actually see them! I love this new place! &#160;Although the lighting is dim, it's like a warm blanket that surrounds you. &#160;All of the staff are friendly, helpful as well as remember your name after only one visit. &#160;On only my second visit, I got the opportunity to sample the newly-made ice cream with it's deep and smooth coffee flavor with a lilting hint of cinnamon in the finish.The burger rivals Gaucho's in girth and flavor with that extra kick of heat at a regular price that is consistent with Gaucho's bar happy hour price &#160;The cuban sandwich is ginormous, ample enough to feed two diners. &#160;Empanadas, served with the chimichurri sauce, tantalize the tastebuds with complexity and brightness. &#160;One of the sides is a chile verde which maintains a well balanced heat and acidity.My only recommendations is to also offer the BB's famed blasted broccoli and the pastrami sandwich, which although do not correspond with the menu's format, are staples which sustain the notariety and popularity of the BB empire.I highly recommend this great establishment! Great food, each ordered has been a tantalizing treat. The house annatto smoked drumettes kick butt, the green chilly cheeseburger hits the spot. Generous cocktails are poured. The staff is friendly as eager to strike up a conversation. Great place to meet friends for a bite and drink when in Seattle
Okay, I've only been here once as they just started pulling up in front of my building in SLU this week, so I can't comment on the pasta. &#160;However, today they served me an AWESOME chicken caesar salad. &#160;Crisp, fresh Romaine lettuce, tender chicken cooked to order, perfect caesar dressing with just the right amount of acid, and tons of fresh shaved parmesan on top. &#160;I have been dying for a decent caesar in SLU for so long...it seems like all the ones I've tried either had bad dressing, wilted lettuce, other unnecessary ingredients that come as part of prepackaged salad mix (don't get me started on those loathsome shredded carrots), or they were way too much money.For $7, this is a great deal and a fantastic chicken caesar. &#160;Plus the guy taking the orders was friendly, and they take credit cards.And for anyone concerned about food trucks not being where they say they will be, well, the city is only getting its act together in terms of zoning places for these trucks to go. &#160;It's not entirely this or any other food truck's fault for not being able to park in their usual spot because of unexpected parking or permit issues. &#160;I don't think it says anything about the quality of the food they provide. &#160;The counter guy at Urban Nomad said today that they have worked out this spot on Republican between Terry and Westlake for at least three days a week, and possibly five. &#160; &#160;I am so glad, because I will become a regular just for this salad. wow! I've eaten a lot of Italian food in my day (in Italy as well) and I will say that was one of the best Italian dishes I've ever had. And it came from a FOOD TRUCK, crazy.... I had the special which was meatballs. &#160;'Turkey meatballs in spicey marinara'. &#160;Sauces &#160;had some exciting spice (not heat) with a ton of flavor, very fresh ingredients. Meatballs cooked to perfection, melted in my mouth. Amazing. DO IT. Best shrimp alfredo I've had in my entire life. &#160;The guy ringing up/handing out orders was incredibly nice too. &#160;I will be back! Meatballs are unreal. They have a nice delayed kick to it - to a point where if you like spice, you'll appreciate it, and if you don't, it may build to be a bit much. Pasta is not al dente but not to say it is not done well. Service and portion was on par with the flavor. Well done.
This tofu is amazing... seriously I opted for Tofu over meat until it was gone. &#160;I will be asking about the varieties they carry next time... because this tofu was cheaper than the packaged stuff and much more delicious.I will have to inquire about the lemongrass tofu... it is currently making my mouth water. &#160;Seriously if you are complaining about Thanh Son Tofu, you obviously know nothing about the word delicious. Best tofu ever. And coming from a vegan that eats lots of tofu, that's saying something. You can purchase a block of the fresh stuff (which is still warm when you get it!) or one of their fried flavors. Either way you can't lose because it is delicious. It's so good, in fact, that you can eat it plain. It's cheaper than buying tofu from the store. We bought a block of fresh tofu and 2 pieces of fried tofu for a total of $1.50. The staff is great! I didn't realize it was cash only, so I got some money from the in-store ATM, which charges you $1.75 per transaction. At check-out the man told me not to ever use that ATM and if i don't have cash, just pay him back next time. Seriously. That's customer service! It may be a bit of a journey to get there, but I'll never buy tofu anywhere else!
Fun, fast, and great light meal! &#160;I tried their curry udon and loved the flavor! &#160;I just wished that it was more thicker than soupy, nevertheless, delicious. &#160;And their shrimp tempura was THE BEST I EVER HAD! &#160;So crunch and flavorful! &#160;Expect to pay $10 for an udon, couple of side dishes, and a drink. I came here with my brother and sister for a weekend lunch on a cold day. They went to a similar style shop in Hawaii last year so they wanted to check this place out. The place is clean and bright, it's located in the U-district so mostly young people eating and working there. The decor and the lighting reminds me a lot about similar noodle shops in Tokyo.Udon can fill you up easily, the more so when you add extra fried stuff like tempura, so go for a medium bowl. On-tama and Niku are the 2 I would recommend, and pick the soup option instead of sauce. The egg in the on-tama was poached just right, such a delight. The takoyaki was good. Everything else was crisp and warm.If you bring kids, get them a Murane carbonated drink, they would love those.Due to the location and inconvenient parking situation, I don't think we can frequent this place. Really 4.5 stars.Cafeteria-style dining at it's best. &#160;They make fresh, handmade udon right in front of you, and pair it with 4-5 types of broth (with some toppings included). &#160;As I was standing in line, I noticed that they warm up your bowls with hot water before pouring in the broth and adding noodles. &#160;It's those little details that tell me this place is legit. &#160;I usually get the regular udon broth. &#160;I've tried the kitsune, but found the tofu far too sweet for my taste. &#160;The tempura bar is pretty expansive and can be a little pricey, especially if you're like me and practically get one of everything. &#160;However, most of the items are very good quality. &#160;I loved the flavor of the chicken karaage and the ebi tempura is always perfectly fried. &#160; &#160;Mega awesome bonus points for having Jones soda carry their fountain drinks. &#160;I would love if they could offer an extra-small bowl size. &#160;I usually can seriously put away food, but udon is very filling and I've never been able to finish an entire small bowl (probably because I grab too many sides). Love the concept &amp; the fact that they make fresh udon but wasn't impressed with the broth. I got the niku udon which is the kind that comes with sukiyaki beef. The broth wasn't too flavorful and had only a faint flavor of the sukiyaki. I was also disappointed that it only came with about 3 small slices of beef! The noodles are nice &amp; firm and you know it's freshly made because you see them cutting it while you wait in line for your order!I love that you can also add all kinds of sides like tempura, karage, takoyaki, etc for a small additional price. Very affordable &amp; quick! Clean space and very friendly service. Wouldn't go out of my way to come here but definitely worth a try. They seemed like good prices at first. What really gets the cost to go up is the tempura. 99 cents for a piece of shrimp. 99 cents for a piece of potato. Before you know it, you're up to 10 bucks with the smallest udon bowl you can order and just three pieces of tempura. Definitely not to my liking. The broth isn't exactly the bees knees either. They give you more noodles than soup. Nothing upsets me more than horrible proportions when it comes to food. And bland food. I had: Curry Udon, Takoyaki for the side.She had: On-tama Udon, Tempura Mushrooms?? for the side.Total cost: $24We had done a quick search for Udon places in the U-District, and this one had positive reviews so we went in. Some background on the two of us first: My girlfriend is a Udon aficionado, previously a chef in Las Vegas (where they have some of the strictest food safety requirements in the country) and still has a current food handling card. She also enjoys trying new places and rarely wants to go back to the same place twice. I on the other hand previously spent 3 weeks vacationing in Japan after graduation, and will eat anything put in front of me.We walked in the door, briefly examined the sign near the front, watched the gentleman behind the glass manipulate the dough that is used for the noodles, and placed our order. From order to sitting down, the food was ready in the space of around 4 minutes, something of importance as our appetites were getting the better of our patience. As Nate W. mentioned in a previous assessment, U:Don Fresh is incredibly clean, and no typical University Ave restaurant nightmares for someone even remotely familiar with food safety regulations could be found here.The curry udon was remarkably similar to what I had in Japan. If there had been a vending machine at the front from which to place my order and the people making my food Japanese, I would not have been able to tell the difference. It was very similar. The takoyaki was very good too, not quite the same but I can't figure out what the difference is. &#160;The On-tama udon was also very good as was the mushrooms, which is typically not something I enjoy.Although we were both hungry and all food tastes better when one is hungry, this was an incredibly good meal for $24 between two people. &#160;This place is great and reminds me of why I love the University Ave restaurants, and we will most definitely be back. The only thing that we didn't enjoy about this whole experience was trying to find somewhere to park the car for free, but that's part and parcel for dining around there. &#160;5 stars. After all the excitement, I finally got to try this place out today!I hadn't had kitsune udon since I had been in Japan (except a bad serving at Genkhi once) so I was excited they had that (medium) and I ordered that with vegetarian broth, one egg and one potato croquette.My boyfriend had the medium niku udon with one egg, one piece of tempura and a piece of onigiri. &#160;Shockingly, this came to $20! &#160;While that isn't expensive, its not quite as cheap as I hoped. &#160;It really adds up so be carefulI liked my udon! &#160;The vegetarian broth is much sweeter than the normal broth which I found odd! &#160;My boyfriend thought the food was fine, but basic. &#160;I was kind of suspicious as to how different the portion sizes were. &#160;I saw someone with a huge egg-sized bowl which we guessed was large. &#160;If not, they didn't seem that different.I also like the simplistic decor of this place and all the calling out in Japanese.I still want to try...all the noodles! Thank you U:Don for providing us with a much better alternative than rat-infested Pita Pit! I ordered the niku udon, and while the beef was quite delicious, the soup was rather bland. I was a little sad, too, because all the tastiness of the beef bleeds into the soup and gets flavorless as well. 3.5 Stars.This is my first time to actually write a review to a restaurant. &#160;I don't want to be harsh or unfair. &#160;I try to generate the whole experience. &#160;And I would say its a fair 3.5....I love udon. &#160;I am from Hong Kong, and I couldn't say the udon in HK is as good as in Japan, (I have been to Japan's ones as well) but I've tried good ones. &#160;I also tried the one locted in Wakiki in Haiwaii as well, so I am familiar with the concept of how to get my order. &#160;The decor is nice for a fast causal place. &#160;And the choices are good. &#160;I chose the medium on-tama udon which is the spring egg with sauce udon. &#160;It looks great.The price is reasonable. So as of this moment, I am still very please and happy.Then I tried the udon, it is too soft. &#160;It doesn't taste like the quality of a "Japanese Udon" restaurant of that's the only thing they are offering. &#160;The sauce base is way too rich and strong. &#160;Usually it's more clear ( I don't know how to describe, but for how I would say, the taste is "clear" lol).The spring egg is good enough. &#160;A lot of green opinions and a little bit ginger.I wouldn't say it met my expectation, but because of my love to Udon, I am happy enough to have a Udon place on the ave, and I will come back again to try their soup base and curry base. I have to give Udon the nod as a sure staple on The Ave. &#160;In me, they left a first time customer happy and open to coming back. &#160;A few things stand out about this place when you compare it to its U-District neighbors. &#160;First, its clean, really clean. &#160;Restaurants that cater to students often skimp on cleanliness. &#160;Since these places compete on price, students can get into the habit of being fixated on the final bill. &#160;Udon makes me feel like I am sitting in a noodle shop downtown. &#160; Second, the ingredients are fresh. &#160;How do I know? &#160;Well you probably noticed every mentioning it, but they make the noodles in house. &#160;Right in front of customers as a matter of fact. &#160;This just doesn't happen in this neck of the woods. &#160;It shows as well. &#160;Their noodles are wonderful.Third, the price is (as mentioned) competitive. &#160;Students and U-District guests will definitely be willing to fork over 7-8 dollars. &#160;You get so much more than the tasty food.*Personally I would shoot for Pho over Udon Soup, but check it out if noodle soup is your thing. &#160;You just might fall in love! This udon joint is legit. &#160;At face value, the udon is really good. &#160;When you're used to packaged udon from Uwajimaya like I am, then this fresh udon is @#$%@# great!I tried the large curry udon + a spicy salmn onigiri and it was $10 and some change. &#160;I walked away quite full and satisfied. &#160;The beef curry was savory and flavorful and chock full of carmelized/melty onions. The noodles were perfect. I'm definitely going back. The restaurant had really nice people and the cook was very happy to answer any question. But overall the food was average, it was cold udon heated up in hot water put in a bowl, and then they pour whatever soup or sauce you want on top. The texture of the noodles was as good as frozen udon and the curry soup was still kind of powdery. This ran up a bill of 10$ but it was a big bowl of udon. So it was average food but it was nice still. Gotta try it once atleast and well, its upto you if you want to go back. Ill probably be back again :D Okay, I know most people are probably disappointed seeing yet ANOTHER noodle place on the ave, but I must express just how refreshing it is to FINALLY have a place that sells strictly udon. What's even better is that these guys are doing it right! (also, I give these guys extra points for making the restaurant look SO much nicer, compared to the acid trip veggies and cheese faces of the old Pita Pit)It is cafeteria style so you grab a tray, order from the people behind the counter, and they serve you within a couple of minutes. It's an extremely quick and efficient system, and because of it I can see this place thriving. They have 6-7 different varieties of Udon soup combinations, and after you get your noodles you can choose a bunch of different tempura options that are individually priced. Really sweet idea! However one thing that was disappointing to me is that they rarely have shrimp tempura because it is so popular... Either way, this place is going to get my regular business, especially to warm myself up during this cold winter season. Great noodles and food at a great price! I am a huge udon lover and this place does the trick for my udon craving. &#160; I had the niku (meat) udon. &#160;The broth is a bit on the sweeter side, but good nonetheless. &#160; The udon noodles were the perfect texture, thickness and doneness. &#160;The tempura sides are great -- enjoyed the sweet potato tempura. &#160;Definitely will return!!! I ordered On-tama Udon and Asparagus Tempura. The tempura was cold and not crispy (probably sat outside too long). The udon noodles and soup were good. The soup wasn't as hot as I would have liked. The noodles were fresh as we saw a chef making the noodles at the restaurant.One friend ordered the curry udon and had probably less than half. She was very unhappy. I wouldn't have ordered it anyways since I'm not a fan of curry and udon as a combination. Another friend ordered the udon with tofu and he said the food wasn't that good either. Having eaten udon at Hawaii and in Japan, I can say those places definitely had much better. But considering this is Seattle and there aren't many other places that serve fresh udon, I'm not complaining too much. It seems pretty hard to mess it up. Solid for what it is. Always fast, friendly, good fresh udon--fast becoming one of my favorite places on the Ave. Other people seem to like it too; it's always crowded. I think the kitsune udon is the best bet. My only complaint is that the tempura always seems to be cold and sort of moist, although flavorful and delicate. If they could get that part of their lineup together it would make it nearly perfect udon fast food. Six years ago, I went to Montreal, and had udon. It was the most tasty udon I ever have. I am fairly disappointed in this place because I had better.As mention in someone else's review, grabbing udon with BARE hand is disgusting. I am sure some glove won't hurt.The broth was really light, maybe I am just use to pho (flavorful). It was so light that a cup of miso soup would overpowered it. The noodles had an uneven texture.The service is wonderful (well a whole team of people greet you.. not sure if they are really happy or venting the anger at you as you leave)I am not a big fan of their cafeteria style. (so many places on the ave do this to save money :( , so no need to have waiter)ADVICE: look at the menu ahead of time, since there space is small. It would be pretty annoying to keep having people pass by you so they can go ahead and order. Good udon a few variations and sizes ($5.50 for a small; a medium is already pretty big). Plus tempura you can choose from ten types cafeteria style. The tempura was light and crisp; especially the shrimp, though a couple of the others (e.g. the pumpkin) may have had time to cool to room temp and weren't quite as fresh from the fryer crisp (but still tasty). Nice and bright, modern place. Bustling with students, some Japanese folks, and a mix of hungry eaters. Just what the university district needs! U have got to get some U:don. &#160;From the minute you walk into the door and see the giant pasta machine churning out freshly made udon, watch it being placed directly into boiling water, being taken out and handed down the line immediately into a bowl to be ladled with steaming broth, you know you have stumbled on to something special. &#160;(You and the rest of the world, of coarse, so be prepared for some slight waits around the lunch rush.)We like the On-toma Udon (the hot, sauced version), the curry Udon and the serve-yourself tempura with unusual vegetables including eggplant, asparagus and &#160;kabocha squash. The staff was friendly, knowledgable, and fun.As tasty as the food is, the restaurant does feel like a cafeteria. &#160;But its a nice and stylish cafeteria with swedish modern design components, black and white photos on the walls, and blonde wood benches.The only major ding, and this is very much worth mentioning since the front of the house and the food here is really enjoyable, is that cleanliness in the bathrooms was an major afterthought. &#160;The back area was really unfortunate. &#160;It was kinda like camping folks. &#160;Even the hallway floor leading to the bathrooms is a mess, lined with stock that apparently will later be used in the dining room, including plastic cups, straws, and silverware. &#160;I could have lived without seeing that. I had the Niku Udon. It was a little bland but after I added some soy sauce, it was fine. I ate at a place similar to this in Hawaii and was hoping to relive the experience. The udon was okay, there are a few side dishes you can get after you get your udon but not many choices. I live in Seatac and it was fun to try but I wouldn't drive to the Ave just for this. The udon is served like a high school cafeteria....Choose the type of udon you want and move on to the next area where you choose soggy tempura... &#160;Sorry soggy tempura is a HUGE NO-NO in my book. &#160;I was about to leave when I saw this. &#160;Comm'on guys...at least serve fresh fried tempura.The udon is just ok if you're craving udon on the ave, but no way is it deserving of anything more than 3 stars.
Kinnaree is a small Thai restaurant in a cute strip on Magnolia that, I think, can fit approximately 50 people. The food was pretty decent, but nothing to write home about. It fulfills the craving if you're in the neighborhood and the service was pretty nice. It wasn't a very memorable meal for me, but I don't think I'd mind going there again, if we're hanging out in the area and we're craving Thai. Maybe the next meal will be better. I have been to this restaurant a couple times now, and gotten take out a few times as well. &#160;It's pretty good. &#160;The food is about what you'd expect, and the service is pretty good. &#160;This is the only option (that I know of) in Magnolia for Thai food, so I sometimes end up selecting it out of necessity. The dining room seats about 25-30 people, but any time i've eaten in there've never been more than 10 of us. &#160;To-Go orders were ready in a timely fashion. Never again. We always order their Tom yum soup here. It's among the perfect combination of &#160;heat and flavor. Most places have a fish sauce aftertaste...but not this place. They also have fairly sizable prawns.
Spectacular small plates....and downstairs conveniently rests a music bar. &#160;Enough said. Thai stop in the middle of Madison park. Great for lunch, especially when you've had enough sandwiches and fried food from Bings.
Love this place! Owners very friendly and the food is delicious.I love there soon-du-bu soup which is a korean soft tofu soup and love their spicy tuna roll!The eel-steak is delicious and the service is amazing!Definately one of the best places on the ave!
I've been here twice and will not be going back. &#160;While the ambiance is absolutely wonderful i've never had a good entree there. &#160;The hen i had was dry and over cooked and the other dish was similarly mediocre. &#160;that said, i do know a lot of other people who have had good experiences, so i'm more than willing to say i just picked the wrong things, but I just wanted to throw out a dissenting opinion on this one. Plin is absolutely wonderful. Gnocchi is great. I don't like white sauce, so i've always only gotten red sauced pastas and they are always fabulous. Service is decent, nothing too good or bad. It's kind of crowded so I don't love the atmosphere. I had high expectations for this place that were not met.The service was good. The atmosphere was ok. It was supposed to be a romantic dinner with my gf but it just wasn't so romantic. We did eat outside and perhaps inside is more romantic. There were just too many people and we were too visible for it to be really romantic.Anyway, the tomato, mozzarella salad was really good. However both entrees that we got were not that great. Pretty much the salad is what brings this review up from a 2 star to a 3.I won't go back. The only reason this is getting 4 stars is because of the parking ...but the food and atmosphere and service deserve 10 stars. Me and a friend went thursday nighat around 7 pm and it was packed ..(25 for 25 I think) but we ended up sitting in the bar and having the 25 for 25 and it was awesome .The general manager/ chef was out and about talking with guests and making sure all was well .what a cool guy. Will definetly be going back but make reservations ... I have always enjoyed my culinary experiences at the intimate Serafina and this past Monday evening did not disappoint! --Molto delizioso!One of the best date spots in Seattle, this truly romantic Italian restaurant delivers an extraordinary menu with excellent service. This place is just as charming inside as it is outside, with lots of natural light, and open floor plan that also offers privacy. &#160;I always enjoy the outdoor patio in the summer, but it was not quite warm enough this particular evening... Beyond the food &amp; beverages, the atmosphere, the music, and the service, there is just something special about Serafina.Our table was not quite ready so we shared a few drinks at the quaint and yet fully stocked bar. Matthew served from the sizable collection of scotches and also made a sweet concoction called Elisir del Fiore... I understood after my first sip, why this is one of the most popular and seductive of house cocktails with St Germain elderflower liqueur.Once seated, we ordered a lovely wine, and a delicious mussels appetizer served with crusty, locally made bread, which we also dipped in garlic spiced olive oil. We also shared the Special Nettle and Basil soup, a delicate treat. I ordered the mouthwatering Pollo en Brodo (Roasted chicken breast with ricotta gnudi, English peas, baby artichokes and Thumbelina carrots in a rich chicken jus). . &#160;Our waiter was attentive, professional &amp; timely. There is no better place for a special occasion, a romantic dinner, or a meal with friends than Serafina. I love this place, from the nice dining room to the back piazza where you sit under shady trees in the ambience -- it's like being transported to another time and place. Yes, the inside dining room can get a bit hot and stuffy, especially in the summer months -- there's not so much ventilation if you're inside. But this is the only negative I can say about this place. I have never had a bad meal at Serafina. I have never had a bad experience either. Go there and have a great time!
I generally only give 1 star when there is clearly an unsatisfactory incident that occurred at the establishment. So a friend and I went to Bell Thai like any other day. &#160;The place was pretty empty and a guy (a guy we usually see there) put us at a table for 2 right by the bathroom and walked off quickly to the back. &#160;My friend asked me if we could move to a different table because it was by the bathroom so I said sure and we moved to a table for 4. &#160;The guy came back and looked at us and said that this table was for 4 not 2. &#160;Then I told him that we didn't want to sit by the bathroom and there were no other tables for just 2 besides the little to-go table. &#160;While he was grabbing the extra set of silverware from our current table of 4, I asked if he would prefer us to sit at the to-go table and he yelled...your choice! and stormed off to the back again. &#160;At this point, I told my friend we were leaving and then the guy came back out and I told him we were leaving and he grumbled something...1 star - Eek! Methinks not on this one... I live near Bell Thai and have kind of wanted to try it for a while so when our original plans fell through, my friend and I decided to grab dinner here. The waiter was really nice. He even recognized me as "the dog walker" who used to work around the corner. I ordered the yellow curry fried rice with chicken. My friend ordered a tofu and broccoli dish. The waiter was attentive and filed our waters when they were low. Our food came out pretty quickly, too. It was pretty decent. I've have better curry elsewhere, but this wasn't too shabby. &#160;The atmosphere is nice. We were seated by the window. I assuming because we were one of two occupied tables. It's a good spot to people watch. And throughout the evening more people strolled in.The waiter was kind enough to split our bill. This restaurant is directly across the street from my friend's apartment, so we decided to try it out last week. &#160;The place was practically empty when we walked in and we had to wait several minutes before someone noticed us and seated us at a table. &#160;The waiter was very friendly, however, and was very attentive during our meal, bringing us plenty of refills of water.I had the Garlic Tofu and it was pretty tasty! &#160;The broccoli could have been cooked slightly more, but that might just be my own personal preference. &#160;The garlic sauce was very good. &#160;The brown rice I ordered with the entree was a little bit overcooked - dry in some spots. &#160;It moistened up a bit when I added food and sauce to it. &#160;The interior is nice and, by the end of our meal, a several more groups of people had come in and seemed to be enjoying their time there.Overall, I wasn't super impressed with Bell Thai, but I would come here again. I often come here for lunch. &#160;Their Pad Thai is fairly standard, but since I don't usually like Pad Thai, I get Pad See Ew or Pad Kee Mao instead. &#160;I did not like their Pad See Ew at all, as I thought it was too salty and heavy on the soy sauce. &#160;I did like their Pad Kee Mao, but much prefer their curries. &#160;I really like their Yellow Curry, Massaman Curry, and Red Curry, in that order of preference. &#160;They also have a good garlic Chicken dish. &#160;Their soups that come with the lunch meal is really tasty too.The staff is always attentive and nice. &#160;The place gets very crowded at lunchtime and is pretty empty around dinner time. The food is decent thai (get what you expect) EXCEPT, twice now, they have messed up my order. I'm fairly certain we will be finding another thai restaurant to dine at.The past two take out orders, they re-arranged the spice level for my and my husband's entrees. &#160;This is awful because my husband loves EXTRA HOT and I like MILD. &#160;The fact that this has happened twice makes me not trust them. :/ We ordered some dishes from here on a movie night. The service was prompt, and the food arrived within 40 minutes, delivered by a nice employee. My favorite thai dish, pad-thai, was a complete disaster- hardly any flat noodles, instead there were 2-inch square noodles- don;t know if that is how it is traditionally made, but in 3 years of ordering thai, this is the first time i saw these square noodles. The peanut-ty taste was dull, and the zest was missing as well. I found the 3/5 spice level on the spicier side as well. The other 2 dishes we ordered were alright, although they were on the spicier side too. The total for 3 entrees came out to $37, which is a good deal.Nothing great about the food here, although their service is good. Ordered Tom Yum soup and panang curry for delivery. I live a couple blocks away, it took well over an hour to get the food and it was lukewarm. The soup tasted extremely fishy and the noodles weren't thoroughly cooked. The curry was oily. Will never eat here again. This place is pretty tasty, they've got a great menu with a lot on it to choose from and friendly waitstaff. I especially like the basil chicken but I wish the Phad Thai was better. The "not what I think of when I think of Thai" dishes are actually really good - the sweet and sour chicken or Mongolian beef, for instance, are things I regularly order because they're tasty and different than what you'd get at a Chinese place and I like the fusion. The decor's all right, nothing amazing, the wait staff is always friendly but a coworker refuses to go here any more since they messed up his order one too many times having put my five star spice on his noodles and his two star spice in my soup! Cheap, fast, delicious. Red Curry, Yellow Curry Fried Rice, and Pad Thai are all great and for $10 there's plenty of food there. Angel Wings (chicken stuffed with ground pork and vegetables) are a great appetizer or meal, as are the gyoza. Some dishes aren't great, like the orange chicken (way too syrupy-sweet) or the anemic fried tofu, but I'm willing to occasionally strike out trying a new dish. Your mileage may vary. I live in Belltown and we often get take-out/delivery from here. For what its worth the experience had been unremarkable - never terrible, never outstanding. Until last night. I called at about 8pm to place an $18 order. &#160;The guy on the other end barked that the minimum order for delivery was $20. &#160;I get the same order each time and this was never an issue before. &#160;But no problem. I politely asked for a second while I found something else on the menu. No more than 1.5 seconds had passed when the guy barked again: "So you going to get something or what!" &#160;I said "yes" and he hissed loudly in response. &#160;I asked why he was being so rude. &#160;He replied he was busy and "didn't have time for people like me". &#160;Really, dude? I said I didn't want anything then. &#160;Before I could finish the sentence, he said "ok, good" and hung up. Being from Jersey, I appreciate bluntness and going from point A to point B of a conversation in the shortest time necessary. &#160;But that guy should be forever banished from the service industry and because of him Bell Thai will never get another penny from me. &#160;And that's too bad because the food was not bad for quick take-out in Belltown (there's a serious dearth of options here). Word. When calling for take out, give them your order backwards, because that's how you're getting it. &#160;One two separate occasions now, I've asked for red curry not spicy, phad thai hot. &#160;Wouldn't seem like a difficult thing to get right. &#160;You probably just want to go in and order to make sure its done right.
I swallowed my deep pride in the culinary heritage of my profoundly Vietnamese background and finally stepped into the portrait of everything snobbish about Viet restaurants these days, the dually hallowed and despised Tamarind Tree.The Yelp scale calls 3 stars "A-OK". And yes, that is what I would simply have to rate this restaurant. OK. Not fabulous. Not overratedly terrible either. A true middle-of-the-road, some pros, some cons, little average deal of a restaurant who simply tries far too hard to cater to newbies to Vietnamese cuisine, and frankly doing a pretty good job at that.The food passed as Vietnamese on my palate, which has been honed by a lifetime of Viet food. Passed meaning, passed. It got a good C+. It didn't taste like the awkward attempts at Asian fusion that you would get at Wild Ginger out by the Market. But it didn't taste like the homey goodness that I came to expect growing up going to the now unfortunately defunct Vietnam's Pearl. It's certainly not the tastiest restaurant on the block (literally, out of the four restaurants on the block, it does not have the tastiest food). It does, however, have the most bloated menu. Choice is nice, but excessive choice teeters on the edge of overwhelming and tacky.My mother and I shared the 7 courses of beef; a series of dishes I've had at restaurants, relatives' houses, and out of my own kitchen. Flavors were cuisine-correct, but hovered and danced around the "too sweet" side. The tea came merely warm and weak. The dishware was cute, and matched the general vibe of the establishment. But again, a little too contrived for my tastes. The food was well prepared, and looked Vietnamese, but face it, at the prices they charge, you're paying for a little more than just something that tastes Vietnamese, you're paying for cute little dishes and more vases for the walls.That all said, the final bill wasn't as painful as I initially expected. It was reasonable. Pulling out the wallet seemed justifiable, even if the food wasn't the best I've ever had.I came in expecting the worst, and I got something okay. Okay. Merely okay. Go to Tamarind Tree if you want. I won't hold it against you anymore. But is it a gem? Nah. Am I the only one that feels Tamarind Tree is over-rated? Sorry to the die-hard fans. I came here frequently when they first opened, in 2005. They've definitely upgraded their decor continuously and details are taken care of. My favorite is their version of Bun Bo Hue, which is meat with a salad, in simple terms. The flavors are subtle, yet fresh. Mixed with the fish sauce, yum. 2 hours later, fatty is hungry though.The reason why I give this place 5 stars:1. Excellent venue to bring friends/co-workers/family/acquaintance that have never had Vietnamese food, or with a limited knowledge of Asian foods. I refuse to take anyone like mentioned to a "hole in the wall" restaurant for their first Asian food experience. One may call me a snob from Bellevue, but I will not eat, nor was I raised on tripe, pig's feet, tendons, and any of that other stuff. 2. Excellent decor/style/ambiance3. I love their Tamarind Tree Spring Rolls! You must try. 4. Service is prompt, polite, and efficient. Reason why I don't come here often: That horrendous parking lot. Ugh. I first stumbled upon this place during its soft opening a few years ago. Since then I've returned a few times. The menu is long and full of dishes totally unique to Seattle. I always take the opportunity to try a new appetizer, unique drink, and dessert. The main flavors of SE Asian cuisine are in full force here--sweet, sour, salty and spicy. I've had stir frys, lettuce wraps, tofu dishes, beef and seafood. Very tasty. It even inspired me to learn how to make Bun Thit Nuong.The prices are *amazingly cheap.* STILL. The dining room is dark and appears classy but if they were to turn the lights up you'd see the corners on the tables are beat up and it's a bit shabby. Still, would be a good place to go on a date if you are feeling like eating adventurously.They make a good mojito.Also check out their sister restaurant Long Provincial in Downtown. Equally awesome food at equally low prices. The menu goes on for DAYS at Tamarind Tree and it completely works to &#160;their advantage. &#160;You could potentially have 5000 different combinations of drinks/apps/small plates/entrees etc. If you have not had their chicken curry served in a bowl with the french bread loaf to soak up its deliciousness, then please stop reading this and head immediately down there and order it. &#160;You would think curry is just curry, right? &#160;Earthy, complex, spicy, sweet and/or savory, sometimes thick, sometimes thin, depending on the region of the world being represented. &#160;This though? &#160;This is the only place in Seattle that serves curry like this. &#160;I have almost contemplated another serving right after finishing the first one. &#160;Looking forward to heading there soon! Oh my, when we drove up to this establishment, I was wondering, 'why are we going to the back of a funky smelling Asian strip mall?' Little did I know, there was an awesome restaurant behind it.Tamarind Tree had a large large menu! I couldn't decide what to order at first. They had a variety of things, but their 5 year anniversary menu had a broken rice special for $5, which I had to take advantage of. I also had the pho special as well.The broken rice was very large, if I had known so, I wouldn't have ordered the pho. Everything tasted delicious, we ordered soo much food (The tamarind tree rice and the crepe were delicious as well)The broken rice dish came with an egg pie that was tasty, and they didn't skimp out when my boyfriend asked for extra fish sauce. The pho was tasty, but I do wish there was more broth.The service was decent as well, and I was happy with the ambiance and the tea that was served. If I lived in the seattle area, I would come again, the food and ambiance makes it more then worth it. The Tamarind Tree is the PERFECT place for all of my culinary Asian inept friends to go to blast their Vietnamese diet of pho and spring rolls out of the water. It's actually a breath of fresh air. Every time I've been to their restaurant it has been packed out with smiling faces and a great decor which is atypical for the international district. Word of warning: prepare to WAIT. The great food and cheap prices make the Tamarind Tree a diamond in the rough. The secret is out and if you don't have time to wait the staff will typically offer to seat you outside (complete with rain proof roofing and outdoor heaters). I took the offer 2x and wasn't disappointed.Good food, good crowd, cheap prices... what more could a food lover ask for? There is no place like Tamarind Tree in San Fran. I forgot how much I loved this place and crave their banh xeo and rice dishes. The food does seem to have gotten better year after year which is nice and refreshing. Yes, &#160;parking sure does still suck and they are still overly busy on the weekends so you feel like you're sitting on top of the person next to you, but everything is fresh and delicious so you won't be disappointed! Tamarind Tree is a classy, hidden gem of a place right smack dab in the middle of not so classy International District. Now when I say hidden.. I'm not kidding! I couldn't find it the first couple of times I tried. You can't actually see it from Jackson because it's tucked into the back corner of their shared parking lot with a Vietnamese grocery and small strip mall.Once inside the beautiful decor and smell of deliciousness will entrance you. At least it did for me. Even if you're not a big Vietnamese food fan you're bound to find something in their 20 page menu. They've got the traditional fare like pho and 7 courses of beef to stuff I've never seen on other menus like &#160;cinnamon pork rice balls.My top picks here are: &#160;Pho (tingles my taste buds like no other broth ever has)Lemongrass Beef RollsBeef Stew with French Bread Sure, this probably will not apply in a few weeks or so when the deal ends but I could not believe they were selling dishes at such a low price! For their fifth anniversary, the establishment has decided to sell some of their more popular dishes like Bun Bo Hue for 5.50 a piece.Nestled in the grungy heart of the mess of a parking lot behind Viet-Wah in Internation District there is little to complain about this place other than its surroundings I suppose. They are tucked away in a weird corner of the parking lot but a small beacon of hope for the otherwise shitty mess that tries to resemble something of functional planning and design in the Viet-Wah "plaza". The outside was remodelled a few years ago to include an outdoor seating area and they also gutted the interior and totally redesigned it to fit more contemporary/modern design. I love it!The menu had a pretty diverse selection of Vietnamese dishes. They had everything it seemed like, from pho to bun bo hue to banh xeo. They also serve alcohol which can be really helpful for those on an all liquid diet and they gave pretty "healthy" servings. I could not really point out anything bad about this place. The service was fast and friendly, food was yummy and cheap and the environment was warm and inviting. I love this place! I really love eating here!!! With that being said- don't let the ghetto ass dimly light wack ass parking lot scare you away from this gem tucked away in a corner of stores I don't step foot into... I've been here a hand full of times, and they have all been outstanding!!! I even came here while I was pregnant- and although I ordered a couple of things of the regular menu, I was really craving a sunny side up egg to go with my steak and rice... so the kitchen was kind enough to adhere to my request- but I mean who would really risk making a hungry pregnant woman mad? Just messing.. I still want to try everything on their menu.... nearly half way there... also this place can get mad crowded on a Friday and Saturday night... but it is well worth the wait. If you like Vietnamese food this place is legit. Probably one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle. I havn't tried much here, basically, about 2 years ago I tried the BBQ pork vermicelli bowl and fell in love and I pretty much get this dish every time. YUMMY! I love their fish sauce it's so delicious. Oh and I don't know what all these noobs are talking about it being difficult to find, it's easy to find if you have eyes and a brain. Tamarind Tree, while tucked away in the back of a shady parking lot, is actually a little more upscale as far as your average Vietnamese places go -- nice interior and cocktails (something of a rarity for Vietnamese restaurants), making it nice place for a date, if you don't mind crowded restaurants and a well-meaning but overworked staff.The menu may be overwhelmingly large, which makes it easy to want to go back and try out different things. I've pretty much loved everything I've tried, so I'll dedicate the rest of my review talking about different dishes.New to Vietnamese food? Try out the spring rolls ("goi cuon") or egg rolls ("cha gio") for appetizers, and perhaps a "bun" dish like "bun thit nuong" for a simple vermicelli noodle dish with grilled pork. These are staples you'll find at many Vietnamese restaurants. There is, of course, also "pho," but in general I like going to restaurants dedicated exclusively for pho instead.Bun bo hue: like the noodle soup goodness of pho, but want something more exotic and with a kick? Try the mildly spicy bun bo hue. Banh khot: like fried food, but want to balance it with veggies so you don't feel so guilty? Banh khot is one of my faves. Banh xeo: speaking of veggies, for a plate with veggies galore you may want to try banh xeo, which I guess can be described as a type of Vietnamese crepe.Banh beo: want a large appetizer to kick dinner off for your group? You can think of these as miniature rice pancakes you eat with fish sauce with a little bit of toppings on it. I think I like the banh beo at Lemongrass better, but it's ok here too. They serve it in individual plates, so you can always stage your own speed eating contests and see who winds up with a higher stack of plates... that's what my dad and uncle did back in Vietnam at least. :)Thit kho: Want to get a taste of Vietnamese New Year? "Thit kho" is a traditional new year's dish since you can cook it ahead of time. It is relatively rare to find it on a restaurant menu, but it's on here. It's pork braised in coconut juices.I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea. :)For more upscale, try: Monsoon. Other places to try: Green Leaf, Thanh Bros for good cheap pho, Lemongrass (easier parking)Try cooking: "shaking beef" bo luc lac. TOFU ROLLS FOR THE WIN!I've never tried other Vietamese food besides pho before coming to this restaurant. &#160;I came here with my mother and father on a very sunny day for lunch. &#160;The atmosphere here is especially cool, and I really like it!We weren't exactly sure what to order...so we asked our waiter for some help. &#160;After talking with him about what to order, we came down to the following dishes.-tofu rolls-green papaya salad-chayote prawns-tamarind tree crepeMy ultimate favorite out of these was the tofu rolls. &#160;They were super fresh and slightly crunchy on the inside. &#160;The green papaya salad was pretty good, it had slices of mango in it, which I love. &#160;The chayote prawns was probably my least favorite of the four because it wasn't anything special. &#160;On top of that, it was pretty bland. &#160;Even more bad news, it was the most expensive dish out of what we ordered. &#160;That is probably why our waiter told us to order it...boo. &#160;The tamarind tree crepe was pretty interesting. &#160;It looked like a giant omelette. &#160;The outside crepe was crunchy, while the inside is soft and melts together. &#160;What throws me off the most about this place is that every dish comes with the exact same fish sauce. &#160;How BORING is that? &#160;If you're going to give me sauce to accompany with my food, atleast give me some variety please!They have a seven courses of beef, which sounds unique. &#160;I'm not the biggest fan of beef, but I find it interesting that they created a set of dishes that contain beef. &#160;If I come back here, I want to try their satay and other rolls. &#160;Their steamed rice paper rolls sound very good too. &#160;I wonder how their pho is...Vietamese isn't my favorite cuisine, but it's definitely unique. I had a demon inside me. It's true. Stupid Demon. It set up camp in my head and nasal passages and made me feel like a puddle of goo. &#160;I could hear it in there singing lame campfire songs as the smell of burnt marshmallows wafted &#160;from my nose. &#160;My head was so stuffed up with it's ridiculousness. I tried everything I could think of to flush it out: Airborne, Claritin, copious amounts of vitamin C, Chicken Noodle, and tea but none of them could rip the demon out of me. That was until I went to Tamarind Tree and had a Pho Exorcism. The bowl of Pho Dac biet (L $7.50 ) came loaded with all the usual suspects: a mess of rice noodles, rare and well done beef, tendon, and tripe. So like a witch mixing up a magical brew I tore at the Thai basil and tossed it in the cauldron of goodness then knowing that my only hope was to sweat the demon out of me I squirted more Siracha into my Pho then BP did oil into the Gulf. &#160;I grabbed my chopsticks, mixed it all up and began devouring the fiery mess and let me tell you it burnt the evil straight out of me and it was delicious. So if you ever find yourself suffering from severe body contortions and chanting in Latin while random objects fly around your living room or you just have a really bad cold go get a Phorsism. Worked for me. This place has a very nice decor and decent vietnamese food. &#160;They definitely aim for the standard americanized crowd and I can respect that, but don't expect the most authentic type of food. &#160;Also, since they aim for the americanized crowd, expect higher prices.I did enjoy their vermicelli noodles and pho, but again, I wouldn't say it's the best, but I give this place 4 stars because of the nice decor and the fact that I would definitely bring someone not accustomed to the low down vietnamese food here.I see a lot of people raving about their Bun Bo Hue, or their spicy beef noodle dish. &#160;I love this dish and rarely find places that make this right, so I will try it the next time I come out. We were in the mood for Bo 7 Mon - that's Seven Course Beef to you all. We had our favorite place in Westminster in SoCal, so we wanted to try to find a new place here. Environment - it's a pretty fancy looking place. We were kind of surprised by the decor (very modern/Asian feel) since it's tucked away in a corner of a random Asian strip mall. Food - The first two courses (beef salad and raw beef slices you boil at the table) was pretty decent. Also, the veggies that they give you are pretty top quality (they even give you some pineapple, plantains to put into your wrap). After that though, the food was just "ehh". Some of our fave beef courses are the meatball, and the meat wrapped in leaves. Since they do use better ingredients, the meat did not taste as delicious...Service - After we finished the first two course, we sat for about 15 minutes for the rest of the courses to come. The waiter did not notice that we were waiting, and then later reports that he had put in the order for the rest of the courses, and that the back kitchen was busy. Regardless, we waited...by that time, our stomachs were feeling full, and we could have just left then.Overall, it was okay. Would I go back there? Maybe if I had visitors who were hesitant to try Vietnamese food. I feel like it is geared towards a more main stream audience, and not the same taste that you would find at some hole-in-the wall elsewhere. When it first opened, I didn't believe my friends when they told me that there is a nice Vietnamese located here. &#160;I told myself that they were wrong and mistaken because there's nothing there but a pho shop in the corner of the parking lot that is always packed when my parents go grocery shopping. &#160;*shakes head* &#160;I was wrong. &#160;SO SO WRONG!Such a cute little place thats hidden. &#160;The food was delish and I will definitely go back there again. &#160;I never actually sat outside, but I know that there are outdoor seatings. &#160;Maybe I'll try that next time. &#160;I suggest giving it a shot... you might be surprised. If you want to introduce your friends to Vietnamese food, this is the place to go. &#160;It is more authentic than Monsoon, better ambience than Green Leaf, and as good as Slanted Door in SF. &#160;For your first time, it never hurts to order anything &#160;that starts with "Tamarind tree ___", especially the roll, it is vegetarian roll that was tasty even for my meat eater hubby. &#160;Also, the crepes are a fabulous and big. &#160;It is one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle, high end or low.I docked 1 star because location is iffy, parking is horrible and I am always afraid my car will not be there when I come back. I came here last night and I have to say...I love this place specifically as a kind of noveau-twist on traditional mom n'pop viet noodle places. it kind of reminds me of some of the more upscale vietnamese restaurants i went to &#160;in los angeles (hello? silver lake??) without the hefty price tag OR the pretense.first of all, can i just say that their DESSERTS are not hyped enough! i'm not even a big dessert fan, but since i came here with two other foodie friends, its pretty much a given that we had to order a couple and split them. oh man...the Red Banana Cognac cake thing is RIDICULOUS- in a good way! so it's a spin on bread pudding, but they grill asian bananas and drown it in a brandy...and...they did TABLESIDE SERVICE! so awesome. i also tried the White Chocolate Ginger mousse which was so sweet, creamy, dense, but had a sharp kick of ginger at the front of your palate. their desserts are make-out worthy.so the rest of dinner was good too. you can read the other reviews and get the same info. tamarind tree spring rolls good, yaddayadda, lemongrass beef excellent...the only thing i'd have to add is that i feel there is a deliberate modern twist here somewhere with their dishes. there's a dill infused tomato broth with one of their noodle soups. i had a chicken braised in ginger-infused vodka. i noticed that they had halibut with other interesting sauces. this is hidden with the more expected b&#249;n (vermicelli) dishes and phos. i'd try this over the traditional fare. it makes for some fun surprises and to be honest, you could go next door and save a couple bucks for a more authentic dish.Tamarind Tree is the perfect place to dine with a group of friends on a night out where you wanna get a little fancier than the average night and dawdle over good food and service. I didn't give it five stars because honestly, while its good food, I'd go somewhere a little dirtier for my vietnamese fix. But that's just my thing. Except for the fact we had to drive back and forth on Jackson to find this hidden gem we loved it! It was packed but worth the wait. The service was fast and friendly and the food.. Oh my...We started with satay and quail legs that were both exceptional. We then had a crepe (specialty of the house) and beef stew. It was wonderful and you must try the tamarind martini, as very unique flavor.Try and enjoy! SO GOOD. And AFFORDABLE!And Oh. My. God.Just yum, really. Between the three times I've been there, I've tried at least a bite of at least 12 different dishes. And every single one was well prepared. The ambiance is great, and there's even an outdoor seating area.Even the bathrooms are nice!The only downside: Be prepared to wait! I don't think they take reservations, so put your name in EARLY! Don't go starving, or you'll get cranky! I have reservations about reviewing Tamarind Tree because it was sort of a secret treasure of mine. I love how the owners have converted a &#160;corner of a grubby shopping center into a Vietnam sanctuary. The inside is just gorgeous and warm feeling with the color scheme, the patio during the summer is like a vacation somewhere in southeast Asia. I love the fireplace with 3 two-top tables built around. The menu is intriguing to say the least. Most people know the Vietnamese standard foods, but T.T. is more of a journey to the heartland of Vietnam with more uncommon dishes like quail grilled in tamarind or the broken rice dish. All the food is presented beautifully and the menu is incredibly inexpensive. You will eat like a king and leave with a full wallet. I love this place! Came here today with a bunch of friends. &#160;Seating was easy for lunch. &#160;The food was OK. &#160;I would say its above average Vietnamese food, the prices were a little high, the atmosphere was nice but the biggest negative was the parking hell i went through. &#160;Im an asian and can tolerate some crazy driving/parking but this is an insane parking lot. &#160;Too many people fighting for way too little spots. &#160;Theres no organization at all to this. &#160;I was in a frustrated mood when i entered this place so that took away some of its allure. &#160;Definitly have a friend drive you here so you dont go postal in the parking lot. Promotion to Five Stars!!Consistency is key. &#160;I have visited more than enough times, especially during their everyday "555" lunch special to fully appreciate this. &#160;The broken rice is my favorite.... broken rice, grilled pork chop, crispy shrimp paste, pickled veggies (and I always add a fried egg on top) = textbook Vietnamese. &#160;The other soups and offerings in their ever changing 555 menu guarantees that you won't get tired of the same 5 dollar dish every time. &#160;To top that off, their three color pudding dessert - che ba mau, is the best in Seattle. &#160;Most other Vietnamese restaurants can't hold a candle to Tamarind Tree. &#160;Just don't get me started about the parking. Stumbled upon this place just 3 weeks after it opened many years ago. &#160;Forgot to Yelp about it! &#160;Modern decor, but a little too dim for my date...but then again perhaps it's a good thing that I'll have to leeeaan in a little closer to see him while talking.Prices were inexpensive when they opened. &#160;I think I spent $6 for an entree, but prices have gone up so now I pay around a whopping $8 for an entree. &#160;Some people complain, but really it's only a few dollars more. &#160;Yummy cocktails! &#160;Endless refills of tea. &#160; I'm a big fan of the noodle bowls and the build-your-own wraps will supply some entertainment.Parking is really difficult during dinner. &#160;This place is quite popular. &#160;I would recommend getting there just prior to 6pm on most nights to get adequate parking and avoid the wait at the door.I reserved the "semi-private" stage area for a birthday dinner party. &#160;There were 10 of us and they said we should all fit, however, I felt it was too tight of a space for 10 of us to fit on that stage. &#160;If you want to plan a group dinner here of more than 6, I would suggest just sitting on the regular floor rather than the stage area.Always nice wait staff and owner even on the hectic busy days. &#160;Try it out now! DELISH! &#160;One of the best Vietnamese restaurants in the Seattle vicinity. &#160;Each visit has been very tasty and satisfying! &#160;The Goods:- Ambiance and decor. The sinks in the bathroom even impressed me!- Prices are very decent. &#160;Esp. the lunch specials - The menu has a wide variety of options but not too overwhelming- Great vegetarian options- Tamarind Tree spring rolls are a MUST!- Service is good &#160;- Cute patio seating outside with a waterfall- The FOOD! The Bads:- Parking can be tricky at times. &#160;Make sure to read all the signs before parking. &#160;I would recommend car pooling there. &#160;- Location is behind the main building from the road so, sometimes hard for first timers.Overall - Go, if you haven't already! You won't regret it. Great resource in the edge of the Chinatown ID. Street presence is modest, but once you're inside the decor is tasteful modern Vietnamese with subdue lighting. Maybe a little cramped at times. I prefer to sit outside where a partially covered roof and ample heaters are available for 3-season dining. The menu has a nice variety of appetizers and entrees and interesting drinks both with and without alcohol. Staff is always prompt and pleasant. Would rate it 5-stars if not for the cramped quarters and wobbly tables outside. I take everyone here that I can, it's just about the best Asian food I have really ever had, and everything I have tried there has been delicious.I usually get the Tamarind Tree rice or the Tamarind Tree Noodles as they have a nice mix of meats and veggies (in the Noodle dish). Sketchy hood, not so sketchy food. &#160;Tamarind Tree is another hidden gem tucked away behind a dark alley near some mom-and-pop Chinese shops. &#160;But don't be fooled. &#160;Once you're in, it's like you've stepped into another world. &#160;The bamboo decor and candles makes you forget that you're at the outskirts of C-town. &#160;It's a little crowded with tables set so close to each other. &#160;But you don't mind that once you start eating. &#160;I've been here several times and the cuisine is super legit. &#160;The Bun Cha Gio is exquisite, the Tamarind Tree Noodles are a must, the Braised Fish Pot is fresh flavorful, and the Grilled Beef Short Ribs are tender. &#160;My stomach growls just thinking about it... &#160;Don't be afraid of the dark alley!! Trust me on this one. If you like authentic Vietnamese Food give this a try. The Atmosphere is warm friendly and good service.The Food is really good my favorite dish is the Tamarind Tree Special. If you are going to eat there you have to get there early or else you won't get a seat. Tell Tam the owner Thach Sent you! Excellent food, awesome atmosphere for a date, It got crazy busy in there, and my girlfriend and I were at a small table with other tables very close by. &#160;I liked it, you could see that it was busy and other people were having fun and drinking. &#160;We tried the seven courses of beef our first time in. &#160;A GREAT option to split, I would have to rank it as my favorite restaraunt I have ever been on a date. &#160;Best Vietnamese restaraunt I've been to ever... I go back everytime im in the international district. You might be hesitant to pull into the strip mall of where the Tamarind Tree restaurant but if you do you will not regret it! their food is great and the Tamarind Tree rolls are fan-freakin-tastic! There is a usually about a 15 minute wait so put your name in, grab a cocktail from the bar, chat with your friends and before you know it they are calling your name to be seated. At first, I was wondering, where in the heck are we? I wasn't expecting such a fancy restaurant in a dinky area. The decor down to the plates were creative and beautiful. They really excel in service and cleanliness. The place was packed and the dim lighting was perfect for casual dates/get-to-gethers.Everything we ordered was superb. We had heartier entrees (chicken vodka and beef stew) to share and a big bowl of rice. YUM! I could taste the flavor, love, and work put into each morsel. I loved the spring rolls, even though I had braces, I enjoyed every tedious chew. The dessert was beautifully prepared too. One of my favorites by far! This place is hidden in china town, it's a diamond in the rough kind of place, from the outside its like.. what is this place, doesn't seem to nice &#160;but when you go in all of a sudden it seems like a pretty high end restaurant. The food was really great, i liked that they had so many options for vegetarians so i was able to find a lot to eat. I especially liked the tamarind spring rolls, so good! We had a party of 7 on a Friday night. Even though they were busy, we managed to get a reservation. The service was friendly, prompt, and suggested a fantastic spread for us. Try the lemon grass martini and the spring rolls...So amazingly good! We celebrated our best friend's wedding rehearsal dinner here and the restaurant gave us a section and allowed us to bring bottles of champagne which was really fun :). All the Vietnamese in our crowd really like this restaurant, so I am gaming that it is pretty authentic cuisine~It's a hidden treasure behind a bunch of stores -- well worth the wait with great food, good ambiance, and good sized portions.You must have the spring rolls, and we chowed down on huge plates of broken rice and roll-it-yourself steamed rice paper wraps. De~licious! What were the owners thinking? &#160;Sure, the interior decor and front facade of this place are very nice but MAN is the parking lot and the building it is attached to are FILTHY. &#160;I didn't care for walking past two smelly dumpsters of garbage before getting to the entrance. &#160;As for the suggestion about it being a great place to bring a date... No way! &#160;In contrast, the menu and food are excellent! &#160;This place could be a real gem if the owners would just move it to a cleaner more upscale part of town and out the the dingy corner it's in. &#160;The service is slow and they seem overworked especially after 5:30. &#160;Overall a good experience but the walk in and out through the parking lot heavily detract from the experience. The stars are for the beautiful decor, cleanliness and overall hipness. &#160;Could be downtown Seattle-worthy. &#160;The food loses stars. &#160;It's okay, but I would never bring my Asian friends here, we know better. &#160;Better: next door at Vietnam House, or a few blocks to Huong Binh.I do agree with another reviewer though that if you are trying to introduce an uninitiated friend to Asian, especially Vietnamese food, bringing them here for thier first experience would be a safe bet for them. &#160;If they like it, then maybe one day they could be worked up to Green Leaf and Vietnam House! First off, must warn you that if it's your first time you may have trouble finding it - it's tucked way back in the corner of the parking lot of a little strip mall-ish thing with some Asian markets in it. &#160;Honestly, you wouldn't think a cute little restaurant would be there. &#160;It does a good job of separating itself from it's neighbors' vibes and manages to be a place of it's own. &#160;Enough about the place, ....service and food:The service was really darn good.The food was good. &#160;Maybe not great, but darn good. &#160;With all the Vietnamese places around to try, the I.D. being so far from home for me, and the decor (albeit cute, clean and trendy) not being a big swaying point for me (the food is king; you can even have surly wait-staff if you have great food in my opinion) this isn't likely to become a regular hang-out for me. &#160;Oh, and watch out! They've got a ton of fun tropical fruity drinks you'll wanna try and even though their food isn't too pricey, the drinks'll kick up your bill - our drink bill was just as expensive as the food portion of our bill! Easily the best Vietnamese restaurant in the city in terms of quality and taste and experience. &#160;Authentic and delicious, with excellent spring rolls (you really cannot go here without getting these...I promise). &#160;The staff is English friendly and the service is like a real restaurant instead of what counts as service at most vietnamese places around town (usually indifferent and slow with ESL being the norm making ordering difficult sometimes).Parking sucks! &#160;Get there early or expect a hunt for parking and a walk to the restaurant. I went back after not being there for a very long time and it was just as delicious as a I remember. We had a large group of 8 eating last night. Sometimes when you go to a busy place, like Tamarind Tree usually is, the wait staff can be impatient when it comes to ordering, deciding, asking questions, what not. But at Tamarind Tree the waitress was very patient, answered all of our questions, even laughed with us and never seemed put off. After reading Kim N.'s review I will have to say be ready for bad service, but that was not my experience. Our server was a woman, so it could just be that specific staff member. The food was a little slow coming out, but we had 8 people, so I expected that and got appetizers. They did come out after my dish arrived, so that was a similar experience. For the 2 hours I was there my water was filled 3-4 times. I will try this place out for lunch sometime to see whether the bad service was related to being their with a party of 8 on Saturday night or just the staff. For the time I went, the service was surprising. I had beef with vermicelli except it wasnt listed under the vermicelli section so I was expecting something different. &#160;I have had this entree at possible 40+ restaurants and this was way better than most. &#160;Sauce was good, beef was of good quality, and the dish was overall very good! &#160;I liked the atmosphere and the somewhat hidden location too! Nice atmosphere. As it was a beautiful sunny day, my friend and I ate outside. We ordered the spring rolls, pho, crepes and bun. We enjoyed everything however the crepes really didn't have much flavor. it was alittle bland but other than that...yummy. they have a sister restaurant called 'Long" on 2nd avenue. I will try that place next time around.... Great food - great price - great place! I love to try different things on the menu, and Tamarind Tree has enough delicious things to keep me busy for a while. The patio is a the place to be on a warm, July evening and the mojitos are the best in town. &#160;The only problem I have is I can't go back again this evening :) I go there at least once every two weeks. &#160;I love the place so much and I never had a bad meal there yet. &#160;There could be some improvements. &#160;Sometimes the chicken, beef and shrimp is too cooked in lieu of being moist. &#160;The drinks are good. &#160;I recommend it to my friends and they like it there too. &#160;The atmosphere and vietnamese music is very nice. You can sit by the waterfall and that is nice too. &#160;The service is good and clientel is mixed asians and Seattlites savoring for a good meal. &#160;I believe they leave very satisfied. &#160;I know I do. This place hardly needs more good reviews - I never tire of it and it's hard not to order the same thing every time...It's a perfect mix of casual elegance and consistently delicious food. Don't hesitate to order much more vegetarian than you normally would. after reading reviews for this place and an article in the paper about their fresh rolls, i took my friend out here for his birthday lunch. &#160;remembering the article i read, i knew i had to order a fresh roll, but which one? &#160;i decided to order the beef roll for the appetizer. &#160;for my entree, i order the short ribs special for $5. &#160;$5?! &#160;thats like giving it away! &#160;my friend order the grilled pork chops still a deal at $7.50. &#160;our appetizer came right away and the entrees shortly after. &#160;i was pretty astonished at the size of all the plates for the money. &#160;each plate was dressed nicely and the flavors and aromas were delectable. &#160;the beef rolls were terrific, filled with meat and veggies and flavor. &#160;my short ribs entree was huge, 2 big slabs of short ribs, rice and veggies. &#160;the side sauce served in a bowl, nuoc cham, made the entire entree pop with flavor. &#160;my friend's pork chops was equally impressive. &#160;three chops, rice and veggies. &#160;other than the food, the service and the unexpected cool, contemporary asian ambiance really completed the great dining experience. &#160;the food, service, ambiance and price combine to give this place a 5 star from me. &#160;this place is larger than it seems, for a small entrance tucked in a corner of a strip mall opens into a fairly large restaurant. &#160;this place gets busy, parking is difficult, but it is worth the effort We went to the http://www.tamarindtreer&#8230; &#160;one night after walking around Capitol hill around 15th and not liking anything we saw there. &#160;Tamarind was an interesting looking, modern place with very good, fresh Vietnamese food. &#160;The staff was very friendly. &#160;We saw outside on the patio which had a nice water feature a wall of ivy that created a nice setting. &#160;Everything we saw on other tables I wanted to try. We will definitely be going back. Good drinks and great Vietnamese food. &#160;I have been visiting this place since they opened. &#160;Great ambiance too, I love the interior design. A little hard to find. Thanks to our friend who works nearby, we were able to find it for a quick lunch. Despite the modern trendy decor, the place was surprisingly affordable. the food is the best part. Fresh rolls were awesome and oddly crunchy. Faux shrimp and tofu for vegetarians was great. Seating outside was very pleasant with candles and fountains. This would be a great place for an inexpensive summer evening date. dont be scared that the restaurant looks like a weird cinemax set, just be excited for their really very tasty vietnamese fair.with shit tons of veg options.their veg shrimp looks like something out of Beetlejuice.AWESOME! This is one classy place and the food is really incredible. It an adventure to find, but it feels like a treasure when you do. You will experience creative food and cocktails in a beautiful setting. I would say this is among the best Asian restaurants in Seattle. This restaurant is pretty tricky to find...it's in the "Asian Plaza" on the corner of Jackson &amp; 12th, towards the back of the parking lot. &#160;Thankfully we took a wrong turn and found this place! &#160;They were booked for the night but told us they could seat us on their heated deck...which ended up being way cooler than inside the restaurant! &#160;Gorgeous waterfall, squished in between other diners so we could see what everyone else was eating, and maybe a little overheated with the heat lamps...if you had told me I was in Vietnam I almost would have believed you. &#160;We started with delicious martinis and the beef roll with lop leaf. &#160;I ordered the vermicelli with pork and an eggroll and my boyfriend ordered the tamarind tree crepe. &#160;My order came out about 15-20 minutes before his did and when his did come out it wasn't what he ordered, it was the other crepe on their menu....kind of a bummer, but he still enjoyed it. &#160;They were pretty busy so we were sort of understanding about the long waits in between courses but he delay in between our two entrees was kind of awkward...and it meant I had to share! &#160;The ambiance was unexpected for a Vietnamese restaurant, to say the least. &#160;We really enjoyed our dinner here and thought it was a fun change. &#160;The food is about on par with Green Leaf...maybe just a teensy bit of a downgrade, but the ambiance and full bar easily made up for it. &#160;We will definitely be returning here! Make a reservation or come early, because when we left the line was out the door! Went here with some friends. I had heard them rave about it before, so I was excited to go. If you were just cruising Jackson street trying to spot the restaurant from the street, you would never find it. It's tucked back in a little lot right next to a market, very unassuming. We went at peak hour on Saturday night, but it was only about a 20 minute wait for 4 people. I recommend sitting outside, as they have heaters for when it gets a bit chilly. The food was authentic, generous portions and well priced. They have an extensive menu, and all four of us enjoyed our meals. I recommend the noodle bowls at the back of the menu. They also have AMAZING cocktails. My favorite was the Mojito. it was balanced, not too sweet, not too minty. Perfect! For a non-alcoholic drink, try the Kumquat soda. Refreshing!I can't wait to go back here. I like the ambiance and the food. The price is right, especially since this restaurant has additional fare not just found in a casual Vietnamese restaurant. I'm an adventurous eater. If you are too, try the stuffed squid and green mango salad. We ate in their outside covered area and felt transported to another world with fountains and fire pits. Temperature was well controlled. Excellent everything. &#160;Service for our large group was perfect despite our chaos and the food was probably the best Vietnamese I have had in Seattle. &#160;Go here! Just had lunch. &#160;Spring rolls of incredible flavor &amp; freshness. &#160;I had a cabbage salad with scallops and a vegetarian crepe with exotic flavors and dipping sauce to die for. &#160;Incredible flavors, colors, textures. &#160;Finished with a ginger flan and banana desert each in their own sauce.This was an amazing experience, incredibly cool place (being so hard to find kind of makes it all that much cooler), and lunch for two was $27 including dessert (we didn't order drinks). Great food, great place to introduce friends to Vietnamese food. Everything is good. The pho is always a great standby. But you definitely want to try "Specialty Tamarind Tree noodles on platter." It's a great introduction to noodles, rice paper, and Vietnamese grilled meats. The "Thang Long yellow fish" is also quite delicious. Would give this place 5 stars, but it's always packed and the service suffers a little due to this. Sit outside on nice days. This is my favorite restaurant in all the world. Everything I've ordered is really good, but I tend to keep going back to the same things because they are out of this world good. My standard order is spring rolls, yellowfish, garlic green beans, and grilled banana cake. If I had to pick four foods to eat for the rest of my life, that's what I'd pick. The bonus is that the prices are good and the ambiance is really nice (which you'd never guess by looking at the outside, which is tucked into a corner of a lot and looks run down. Fantastic surprise, coming through the door and finding an upscale, modern interior.) I'd give it 6 stars if I could. tamarind tree roll, lemongrass beef roll, lychee martini. that's all i have to say. nuff said. num num num num. I got to play with my food so I can't complain! A friend from work took me here and ordered some sort of fresh roll-esque meal with chicken. It was amazing... you cook the rice noodles in a bowl of hot water at your table. I am not sure I would be able to order it again (the menu is crazy long) or find the restaurant again (located in the corner of some random strip mall in the international district), but one way or another I will be back! I was recommended to go here by a Seattle native but I can say that I was surprised even though he was adamant about the fact that it is great. &#160;Tamarind Tree is located in the back of a dirty parking lot behind an Asian grocery store. &#160;Its next to impossible to see from the street but I would recommend people to LOOK FOR IT! &#160;The food and the atmosphere are great. &#160;A buddy and I tried a few things and each one was awesome. &#160;It was completely packed but the servers were quick and we were attended to quickly for everything we asked. &#160;The place was clean and the decor was great especially since its a surprise being so hidden in a run down parking lot. &#160;I loved this place and I will be taking anyone that visits Seattle to eat there!
It was lunch that i was looking for and after walking to Market and 24th from Phinney and 45th, i felt a little bit of a splurge was in order. Last I'd been by they were under construction and &#160;i was a little unimpressed by the way it looked like a Johnny Rockets. i wondered if there was a menu in the window so &#160;I kind of wandered by when &#160;Mike, the manager (or owner? don't know) came out. "You coming in?" He greeted me. Sure why not! I took a seat at the bar, and was warmly greeted by Brandon the day bartender. Looking over the menu, there was a great variety of burgers, a decent variety of beers and a handful of appetizers. Thats as far as i got on the menu, because i was immediatly struck by the idea of a 'jalapeno popper burger"From the menu "jalapeno popper burger - we stuff roasted jalapenos, cream cheese, and cheddar cheese into a burger, bread it and deep fry it to a crunch, with lettuce, pico de gallo and guacamole - 9.59"The burger came with bottomless fries that could have used an extra minute or two in the deep fryer. The burger was something to behold though, cheesey, spicy, juicy and yum. The buns made by Olson's bakery I here were delightful and reminded me a lot of the buns Fudruckers make. Yum. &#160;i can't wait to go back. Went here for dinner last night. I didn't get any booze but I was happy to see it was available. Boyfriend and I got delicious burgers, fast service - I mean we were waiting for about 3 minutes after closing our menu when some guy in a Hawaiian shirt (I assume he was the Harry) asked if we had been helped yet, and apologized. The onion rings are the small thin kind, which is a nice change, and yeah the fries are limp and greasy, but OMG NOM NOM delicious. And yeah, the burgers are pretty amazing too. And big! I barely could finish it. I am always on the look out for a great Veggie Burger. &#160;I tried. The wait person could not tell me who makes the patties, however, assured me they use only the freshest ingredients. The veggie burger was gross.It tasted like an old Salisbury stake from a cheap tv dinner. Someone told me that comes from it being frozen too many times or for too long.The fries were soggy and flavorless. It was only the fact I was so hungry that I ate most, not all, of it.They do have a salmon burger, however, it is farmed! I don't understand how a Ballard restaurant could serve farmed fish!.....Oh yeh, Hamburger Harry's is a chain.Don't waste your time Veggie Burger Lovers.....go to Scooters instead! I'm not sure we really needed another burger joint in Ballard - they are spreading like viruses. &#160;But, I am happy to see the life of Market extend past 24th, especially into the non-starter Sea Breeze restaurant. &#160;And, I was excited to go to a burger place with a full bar.I was greeted quickly and warmly and took a seat at the bar. &#160;No Hornitos tequila for margaritas. &#160;No mint for mojitos. &#160;Hmmm, okay. &#160;The bartender (very nice and attentive) recommended a martini made with LEMONHEADS. &#160;Okay, I had to give that a try, and it was as bad as you would imagine. &#160;The Mitchell family should consult with a mixologist to create some new and innovative drinks that actually taste good. I liked reading on the menu that the hamburger buns are made daily by a local bakery, and the beef is produced on Vashon Island. &#160;Nice support of local suppliers. &#160;The other items on the menu were the same old same old - chicken strips, Caesar salad, and their ilk. &#160;Yawn.The large windows that open to the street are a welcome addition on a warm day, and the breeze that floated in from the sidewalk was lovely. &#160;There were tons of wait staff around, running to and fro, seeing to customers. &#160;You can tell they are trying very hard to please, and they were pretty busy for a Monday night.Hamburger Harry's is a bit schizophrenic. &#160;While it has the vibe of a sports bar, the tee shirts show a person in a tux and white gloves using cutlery to slice into a burger. &#160;There is nothing upscale about the place, and in fact it's painfully obvious a male decorated it. &#160;First, there is the overused and overdone red/black/light gray/dark gray interior, mixed of course with some stainless steel. &#160;But, even in that Nagel-like interior, the flooring is boring, off-white tile. &#160;Next, the wood of the chairs does not match or even compliment the wood of the tables or bar. &#160;The three smaller and one large flat screen televisions would make for a good place to watch a game, but the clutter and mess of wires and gizmos under the big screen seriously detracts. &#160; &#160;The unkempt wait station can be seen from the bar, and a big yellow hand cart sat against the wall seemingly in the center of everything. &#160;With all the sports memorabilia along the walls and the dust on the back bar, the vibe was distinctly bachelor pad. The cheddar cheese cheeseburger arrived with garlic fries. &#160;The fries are made fresh (translation: limp and tasteless) and are nothing to shout about, even when drenched in garlic. &#160;I never need to salt my food, but I was quickly asking the bartender for some salt for the fries. &#160;The fries are bottomless, but it's a safe bet the joint won't go bankrupt serving seconds or thirds.The burger? &#160;Okay. &#160;Just okay. &#160;The bun was soft and fresh. &#160;The beef still managed to be juicy despite being overcooked. &#160;I liked the special sauce made by the restaurant. &#160;But still, somehow, it lacked real depth of flavor.I would venture back to watch a game, but that's about it. Had dinner there 3 days after they opened. &#160;They were slammed. &#160;Word is out and Ballard is curious! &#160;Most of the tables were filled but we were greeted and seated promptly in the bar area. &#160;They have one giant TV and &#160;four large flat screen TVs, showing a couple of different MLB games. &#160;Drinks arrived promptly, food arrived within 15 minutes during a peak time. &#160;Servers were friendly, and apologized for things being a bit harried. &#160;A few people came in the front door but were not greeted right away, and so turned around and left, probably thinking it was "not a good time right now". &#160;(a "See Host / Seat Yourself" sign would be a good thing).The burgers were very good. &#160;I had a bacon cheese burger and my partner had the beer cheese burger. &#160;Ask for extra napkins. &#160;Juicy and delicious. &#160; The fries could have been better...they were limp and swimming in oil. &#160;More time in the fryer and strainer should do it.Harry's burgers beat Red Mill, we both agreed.Definitely worth a return visit.
I love this place, too bad it's so far away from my home in Olympia. :( The entire staff is very friendly. Being &#160;Salvadorean, I am particular about my pupusas. They have to make them &#160;just right and Guanaco's Tacos makes the best ones out there, at least out of the other 3 pupusa places I've tried in Washington. &#160;I ordered the sampler platter (I've uploaded a picture to Yelp) which comes with three traditional Salvadorean items, &#160;one pupusa (I ordered revuelta; pork, beans loroco and cheese), yucca (I ordered mine fried instead of boiled) and one pastel (fried corn dough filled with a ground beef mixture). Their pupusas: The dough is greasy-crispy on the outside, the dough inside is soft and the filling made of ground pork (chicharron), beans, loroco and cheese) is seasoned nicely and was oozing out of the pupusa as I cut into it. &#160;My mouth is watering as I'm typing this! Pupusas made to order!The Yuca Frita : Another Salvadorean traditional dish is served with fried or boiled &#160;pieces of yucca. I ordered mine fried, again, it was crispy on the outside and soft and tender in the inside. It is topped with slices of tomato and chicharron (fried pieces of pork). &#160;The Pastel : Another fried item on my plate, corn dough filled with a ground beef mixture. The filling was juicy, seasoned right. The sampler plate comes with a side of spicy curtido (shredded cabbage, carrots, onions, oregano pickled in vinegar, kinda like coleslaw but pickled). Some curtidos can be spicy but this one wasn't very spicy. Salvadorean food isn't known for its heat, usually mild.Horchata: A typical Central American drink made of rice, cinnamon, morro seeds, sesame seed and other spices. I was very surpsied with Guanaco's Tacos' version of Horchata. The owner told me they add Salvadorean chocolate to it (they import from El Salvador!). It tastes rich and very good. It's a first for me and I'm sure there are regions of Central America that make it this way. Certainly different and a whole lot better than the usual rice and cinnamon drink you find at many Mexican/Salvadorean restaurants who use pre-packaged powder forms. My husband ordered the pork burrito. When he took the first bite, I saw him rolling his eyes as if he was in heaven. He really enjoyed the burrito.Everything was fresh and made to order and I will be coming back again. I promised the owner I would bring my parents to try it out next time. A cool thing about this place is that in the 30 minutes that we were there, Chileans, Hondurans, Guatemalans and Salvadoreans (myself) walked in for some good food. I got hooked on pupusas while living in the Mission District in SF. Guanaco's satisfies! &#160;Hand-made on the spot so you can customize yer fillings. The curtido is fresh and yummy. They're also embarassingly cheap at $1.90 apiece, I frankly can't eat more than two.Eduardo, the propietor, is very friendly - one time my spouse ordered the chicken dinner and he came back out and said he just couldn't serve what he had available and switched him to the steak. It was wonderfuly marinated and REALLY good. &#160;The Horchata is also very good, not that cinnimon-red-hot tasting fountain crap, but starchy and tasty. Vegans might check first: he mentioned he sometimes adds a little dairy milk to smooth the flavor/texture.Delivery is by bicycle mostly to the UW campus area, alas my office across the bridge on Eastlake doesn't count. I had the chicken tamales and a pupusa. The tamales were pretty gross - the cornmeal was mushy and flavorless, and the chicken had a very strange flavor... I've never had canned chicken, but I'm thinking I came close with the chicken in these tamales. The pupusa was alright, sort of bland. I would go back for one of those, but only if I was strapped for cash, in the neighborhood, and mad hungry. The horchata was dark and tasted vaguely like ovaltine. I've had much better. I think it was just from a mix. While the pupusas are cheap and filling, the rest of the menu is way overpriced. I'd say skip this place.
I don't know what else I can add to 100+ reviews and the fact that the place is, after all, a Cheesecake Factory. Just like every other one in the world, they feature a huge menu of slightly above mediocre food served in gigantic portions. Their cheesecake is very good, but that of course assumes you still have room for dessert when you're done with dinner. I love to hate the Cheesecake Factory. For one, it was very close to where I used to live so I went there quite often. Two, the portions are huge and I usually eat the leftovers for days. Three, the Bellini is delicious and I forget that I get a brain freeze every time I drink them! And Four, after you eat dinner there is no way you can fit a piece of cheesecake in your mouth. I really do like the food at the Cheesecake Factory. I think they should make smaller portions and have cheaper prices for those smaller portions. That would really make people who are watching what they eat happy! I do love their cheesecake. I love the decor; I always feel like I'm in Las Vegas in the Venetian hotel. Great place to go; Seattle and/or Bellevue. were still full from lunch so just grabbed a couple of appies.. corn cakes which are to die for.. topped with salsa, guac and sour cream.. they are simply amazing.. we also had some crab wontons that are made with cream cheese mixed with the crab. &#160;to top it off we had a limited edition cheesecake.. the turtle caramel cheesecake for dessert.. it was pretty amazing! &#160;my sis went to bellevue 2 days later and said the waitress said they discontinued it.. let's say that she was pretty disappointed! &#160;but perhaps it was only at that other location.expect a wait especially after 7 on a fri or sat.. but we got in around 6ish and only waited about 20. After a week of decadent eating, my boyfriend and I decided to stop at the downtown Cheesecake Factory for a casual meal. We got seating near the big windows, with great natural light and perfect for people watching downtown. Our waiter, Jed, was friendly and attentive, and our food came out fast. This CCF was clean, fast and friendly, so I would definitely visit again. The scariest part was the nutritional guide they left on our table with the menus. Some on the calorie counts can really ruin your meal!! Needless to say, we didn't order any actual cheesecake. I've been to 3 cheesecakes but i'll just go ahead and review this one since is the last one i visited,there's no reservations so if you're lucky you won;t have to wait 4 minutes like i did i was mentally prepared for it so no biggie,sat down i already knew what to order,Grilled Shrimp bacon sandwich oh yea, the service is always great and quick,the decor is all the same in all the CCFs &#160;fake stucco,giving you a warmth sensation.its definitely one of my fave restaurants ipb While convenient if you are at the convention center it is probably the least imaginative option for eating out. Beer selection could be a lot better.The food is good and the service is good like you would expect from any Cheesecake Factory.If you are looking for something familiar then this is the place to be. Been to one, been to them all. Had the Weight Watchers light oriental chx salad yesterday. Decided on it after looking at how many calories are in the meal offerings at Cheesecake Factory. Word to the wise: if you eat here, don't look at the calorie menu. If you are watching your weight, CHOOSE wisely. I have nothing against chains that get it right, but the Cheesecake Factory is overhyped and underwhelming. I have eaten at the Cheesecake Factory twice now in two different cities and can not say I am impressed.Experience #1 &#160;I say overhyped, because the only other time I tried to eat at the Cheesecake Factory, was back seven or eight years ago when I lived in Sandy Eggo, and work told us they were treating us to Cheesecake Factory. And then....we arrived at the infamous Two Hour Lunch. And waited to be seated. And waited. And waited. And walked across the parking to the Costco, made a round of the free samples, came back, and waited some more. Woot. The boss had promised us and he'd obviously felt like we'd invested all that time in waiting, we might as well wait til we were seated. Which we were eventually, in the time that it takes solar systems to form and life to evolve and species to go extinct. I don't remember what I had except that it was boring and pasta-y and we'd taken so long getting to lunch that we didn't even have time for cheesecake. Every time I'd go by a Cheesecake Factory, I'd always see a pile of people spilling out the doors, ALSO obviously waiting, and I'd want to yell at them, "Flee, flee, while you still have years left in you!"Experience #2 (Last night, Seattle) - My boyfriend and I are kicking around downtown Seattle, looking for a place to eat. We happen to walk by the Cheesecake Factory, and miracle of miracles, there's not a line. Holy shit. I tell The Boy that I still have yet to experience the cheesecake of the factory, and he says he once went years ago (and relates a similar story) and he hasn't had it either. So we relent, and see if they can seat us. And they totally can. (Cheesecake Factory Tip: Go on a Tuesday at 8.30 apparently.) So we get seated, and the terminally perky waitress drops our menus down for us. I get a Flying Gorilla (a banana-chocolate drink, which is actually pretty good, and about the one part of the meal I enjoyed) and settle down to peruse the menu. My boyfriend makes the observation that the menu is HUGE, and he always gets nervous when he sees the menus of hugeness because half the time it means that all the appetisers and some of the other dishes are frozen in ginormous fridges in the back, because there's no way they can cook all of these on notice. This prognostication proves to be likely true, as my overly salty and processed Tex Mex egg rolls attest. It's hard to say about my mushroom soup, but it is very peppery to the point where the mushroom flavours are overwhelmed. I've even had awesome mushroom soup at a chain before and this wasn't it. The Boy gets some pasta dish which he describes as "Very meh." Oh, and I STILL don't know how the cheesecake was because we decided to cut our losses and pay the cheque instead of waiting for the dessert. The service was okay, although the waitress seemed to have perfected the "Wait til their mouths are full and then ask how it is" technique. A tiny bit slow too. The food was a big meh, and at the prices, not so great. &#160;The ambience feels kinda pretentious. And I can't believe that people wait in line to eat here. There's nothing I ate that wowed me enough to say, "Well, I'd come back to get THAT." It's like, you pay for the restaurant experience and end up with bar food--and if I wanted bar food, Six Arms is conveniently a few blocks up Pike.EDITED TO ADD: The Boy and I have since tried the Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake. We got a white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake to go, and brought it home. It was expensiveish but very delicious. Our guests also enjoyed it. So in that respect, I will say Cheesecake to Go: 4 stars. &#160;(It still takes a while to wait for the cheesecake-to-go, and sometimes it is frozen rockhard, which means if you needed it for an event, you should plan a few hours for thawing.) &#160;I remain staunch on the actual restaurant experience though. The non-cheesecake food is mediocre, and the restaurant is overhyped. That remains at a solid 2 stars. Used to be good and reliable. I mean it's a chain so you sort of know what you are getting when you go there. &#160;This location seems to have lost it's will to live. &#160;The servers are dull and don't seem to care about anything. They also look like they've been on the same shift for a week and in the same clothes! &#160; The place smells a little bit as well and the interior is starting to look dated. The food used to be reliably "OK", but now it's just blah. Save your money on a better meal somewhere else, go for drinks (which are ok) or cheesecake. I have never been to a Cheesecake Factory before. The inside was amazing until my friend told me they all look like that.The menu was huge! Pretty much anything you could possiably want! Friendly wait staff, quick seating. Very pricey! I had a burger and fries, which was very good. Very nice food arangement on the plate. I was far too full to venture into the cheesecake area. Seriously, why would anyone eat someplace that features advertisements in it's menu? What's next, ads in the dessert. Skip the wait, food and 2500 calorie entrees and go to a local place. Okay it's a chain but I STILL haven't had any cheesecake better than the cheesecake factory dessert soooooooooooooo I would give it a 5 star for their dessert but a 3 on their service. &#160;They are a bit slow, servers look stressed out, and last time I went there was something in my food. 97% of the time I go just to buy some cheesecake slices. &#160;Lemon raspberry is my favorite!!!! I've tried at least half of them. &#160;This is the less richest and it melts in your mouth. Even on an early Monday evening, the wait was LENGTHY. &#160;Everytime a new group came in - regardless of the size - the hostess chirped "about fifteen minutes", which must be standard protocol here. &#160;We waited at least thirty minutes. &#160;The food is predictably good and remarkably quick given how busy they are. &#160;Our server, "Daniel" was speedy and accomodating. The avocado egg rolls are a stand-out and, in general, all the portions ginormous. &#160;My best advice: Get the yummy appetizers but split entres with another person if you cannot take your leftovers with you. (theater tickets prevented taking anything with us)Sure, it's a chain but if you're going to go to one - and feel like spending 80 bucks on lunch - this is the one to go to. I came here for my birthday. I went on a weekday, so it was a lot less crowded than usual. If you're going to go on a day that's often busy, I don't see why you're going to complain about waiting long unless it's your first time there and you didn't know. You chose to go there, and I'm betting you knew it would be a long wait. Boo hoo.The service was friendly and quick. Our first server went on break, and the replacement was horrid. She didn't smile and she was snappy, but the other two servers we encountered and our original were just awesome. There was one specific dude who was just freakishly funny.The food came fast. Selection is nuts, but I feel like everything in each category is about the same just altered slightly. The only thing that bothers me is that their Cheesecake menu doesn't list prices of each cake slice, only a range at the very end. I hate cheesecake,but I quite liked theirs.Now, for a nutrition freak like me, I about died when I saw the nutritional menu. Most of my friends and I only finished about half the plates though. And when you're eating out, what do you really expect? The cheesecake is the real thing you have to worry about in terms of nutritional value. Those slices are huge. And they are so, so bad for you. I shared one and I still felt so guilty.Price was average for the size and considering that it is dinner and you are eating out.The interior works for both casual and dressy. You could go in there with jeans and a tee shirt or in a dress (like we all did) and you'd still fit right in.And since it was my birthday, they gave me a little sundae. It was absolutely delicious. And they sang a song. It was embarrassing, but the waiter that I absolutely adore? He made me laugh so hard during the song with his unique personality, it was worth it.The waitress also gladly gave us separate checks, and remembered what all nine of us each ordered. I don't know if she wrote it on her pad or not, but if she didn't, maaaaaan what is she doing waiting tables with that kind of memory?I can pretty much say that when I get a legit job again, I will be coming here more often than just a couple times a year.Oh, and the leftovers taste delicious. Just .. don't get the four cheese pasta if you're expecting to take it home and eat it the next day. My best friend did, and she slept over. She microwaved it to eat and the cheese was just ... a disgusting clump. Oh ick. First of all, don't get me started on how my friend, who was entertaining a first-time-Seattle-visitor-from-England, decided to take him HERE. I mean, really, there wasn't a more original option to choose?And don't get me started about the uncomfortably awkward server, who would unnerve you by repeating everything you said, and being waayyy too formal for a glorified Red Robin.And I can't even talk about the novel-slash-menu, filled with enticing-sounding dishes, but when you looked at the nutrition information you didn't even want to order a salad. Three days later, I'm still finding it difficult to form words due to the oil slick made in my mouth by the pasta I had. This is maybe the first time ever when I had three days worth of leftovers but haven't wanted to revisit the experience. And don't ask about the over-packaging they do when you have a doggie bag or order cheesecake to go. Huge containers, plus a plastic back to carry i home in? Not necessary.With all this stuff I can't talk about, there's not much I can say about the Cheesecake Factory.Err...the bathroom was nice? The Cheesecake Factory was able to make the grilled portabella mushroom sandwich with no cheese/dairy and it was still tasty!Granted, I've never had a slice of cheesecake here but their mushroom sandwich and french fries are YUMMY! With my lactose intolerance, I find it awesome that I can eat here because they were still able to make a delicious sandwich dairy-free! :)If you're over 21 and it's packed as hell, you can get a seat in the bar area and still order food there. Just make sure it's for a party of 2 at the most. Brought husband here today for his first visit, my third. &#160;Service was excellent. &#160;Restaurant beautiful! &#160;I had the fish tacos. &#160;Delicious. &#160;Hubby had the grilled shrimp club sandwich, also delicious. &#160;We each had a beer and got a piece of their pumpkin pecan cheesecake to go. &#160;Total bill was $50. &#160;A great deal for the good amount of food served in a nice atmosphere. &#160;Will go to the Southcenter location next to see how they compare. So this is obviously a chain. &#160;However, it's one of my favorite chain restaurants to go to. &#160;The service I receive here is usually pretty great. &#160;To start, I love the bread I get while waiting. &#160;They never seem to mind bringing me a second basket which is good since sometimes the wait can be quite long. &#160;The menu is expansive and I can always find something I'm in the mood for. &#160;Usually the real problem is limiting my options. &#160;However, the pasta da vinci is one of my favorites. &#160;Also, the cheesecake options are great and perfect for someone like me who isn't a big fan of "plain" cheesecake.So what makes this Cheesecake Factory different? &#160;A few things. &#160;First, the wait. &#160;You're almost always in for a long wait during any sort of peak time. &#160;Luckily there are some interesting characters on the sidewalk out in front usually which can provide entertainment should you require. &#160;Second, the service. &#160;I've been here on numerous occasions and almost always had a server who was extremely attentive each time. &#160;The one time a friend and I ended up waiting what seemed too long for our meal, a manager overheard us talking about how long it had been and gave us each a free slice of cheesecake without us even complaining. &#160;Lastly, the location. &#160;It's a good place downtown and when you have a group of out-of-towners who want food they're familiar with or they're chain restaurant type folks this is a pretty good place to go. the place- clean, high ceiling with warm dim lighting, tables can be put together to accommodate big party. can be very loud if you sit way back toward the kitchen. the food- hit or miss. my favorite are, Thai lettuce wrap, avocado egg roll, corn fritter, and the pasta devinci. most of the high end menu items are not that tasty. the portions are huge. the service- so so. Oh no a chain! &#160;Well yes, indeed, you are correct. &#160;But they are actually quite good for what they are. &#160;And this is coming from someone who really doesn't care for cheesecake. &#160;We came over as a group during PAX, which meant a wait of course but seriously, a 15 minute wait during a conference and at peak hours was not bad. &#160;Our server was perky and polite. &#160;But the menu, it's as insane as everyone as commented! &#160;Truly it's a task to make sense of it or to find something you would like. &#160;Then you need to be concerned about sizes. &#160;Since everything here is based on the scale that you are a 10 ft giant with a super fast metabolism. &#160;Yeah.... right.....And then you have that whole menu of cheesecake. &#160;Thankfully I can just skip that since it invokes nausea. &#160;The food however does not. &#160;Ordering the smaller sizes and appetizers was the way to go. Plenty to share and not too many leftovers.Overall, a good experience when you are stuck downtown. &#160;But expect tourists and waits.
The second star is for the boat o' tofu that they served me as an appetizer. The Tom Kha soup was basically just mushrooms and coconut milk. Even I can make that. We didn't even bother ordering anything else. This place is mere steps away from my place and I don't think I'll go back. This place deserves no stars (even though I had to give it 1 to get this posted) and judging from my experience and some of the other comments posted, they really don't want your business. &#160;Stay away! &#160;Unless, of course, you want:Bad or no service from seriously strung-out tweekersQuestionable food qualityTo be overcharged for everything you order (whether you get it or not)Really, if that's what you want out of a restaurant, please go to Jai Thai. &#160;Otherwise stay away. &#160;Besides, there are 12 other Thai joints on Broadway and I guarantee that even the worst of them beats this place by a mile! Wow. I'm surprised this place got so many bad reviews. I'm calling everyone out and disagreeing! I quite like Jai Thai! I've been here several times, and each time the food never ceases to satisfy me. I love the back bar area booths that you step down into (even though it is a little cheesy with the disco ball and all). The dish I ordered was amazing. It was a perfect blend of spicy, sweet, crunchy, chewy and salty. I couldn't get enough of it and finished off every last morsel. Maybe I just haven't been spoiled on Thai food like some people. I think that this place is a great place to go for Thai "beginners" like me. The only thing that bothered me was that the service was a little slow at times and while we were eating some "band" was setting up. We were seating right in front of the stage so I felt like I was in the way of the people trying to set up. We scarfed our food before they actually started playing. It would've been awkward to have people staring in our direction while we were trying to eat messy noodles. Just say no.Look man, I know what it's like - you're killing time around Broadway with your friends. &#160;You might be starting or finishing your night, and you realize that hey, Jai Thai's neon light is on, and they're still open! &#160;Man, that's great, a Thai place that's open late! &#160;This is way better than T-Bell, and gives you more international cred than Broadway Grill! &#160;But my friend, you must resist the urge, unless you want your evening ruined.Maybe ruined is too strong a word. &#160;No, the painfully slow service won't kill your night - unless you had to be somewhere, that is. &#160;Just because they will mess up your order, it doesn't mean the entire day has been wasted - just the time you spent here. &#160;If you have a group of people, one of them might not get their food brought out at all. &#160;I loved it when one of us didn't get the order, and the waiter tried to pin it on one of the other diners - "he's got your order!". &#160;Uh, great. &#160;But hey, you're with your friends, and you can have a great engaging conversation about the poor service, the long wait times, and the very average food.If you want Thai, you have other options. &#160;If you want late night grub, just go to Charlie's and fill your gut. The thai food is okay, happy hour can be great, but the waitstaff is HORRIBLE!! I went during Sunday afternoon when dead and the two women just stood in back and talked for 15 minutes before me and my friend got up and left. On Jai Thai's scale 'o hotness I ordered a 2 out of 4On my scale of hotness this was a -15 out of 10Seriously, how hard it it to spice a thai dish? At least it would have had taste if you tossed in some chilis.Food was so so, but not worth the price. Cheap and good thai food abounds. One star is for a cool back room and the second star is for the very cool alcove tables that are surrounded by drapes. 1 star for the poorly prepared foodthe 2nd star...????If you're on Broadway and a friend suggests going to "Jai Thai" convince them to go to Jack in the Box instead. As it turns out, I am one of many people in the Capitol Hill area searching for late night Thai restaurants open after 10PM. &#160;Sure, on Friday's and Saturday's some of these restaurants are open until 11 but why do I have to wait until the weekend to get late night Thai Food??Because going to this restaurant during their late hours (serving food daily until 1am) is not worth your time, effort or money.Hmm....tofu w/a sweet and sour type sauce..meh it's okay....First, entering the place with a friend we were seated 10 minutes after we came in. &#160;After sitting down and looking at the menu we noticed many of the patrons before us were still waiting on their food, so what did we do? We ordered take out from the table.Leaving my table for a few minutes I called the restaurant and ordered A 4 star chicken Phad Thai, a Hot and sour Thai Soup and fried tofu. &#160;"10-15 minutes." says the trusty waiter.My companion and I leave to walk around in the warm evening and we return about 20 minutes later...food...still...not...ready!!!We waited a total of 30 minutes for our food and we were not very happy at all.The Hot and sour soup was anything but "Hot and sour." The Phad Thai? Most likely the worse Phad Thai in the city!!! Their wasn't even any spiciness added to it!!!!! (and for $8.95? get the sh*t outta here! I have more taste in my bottled water)I can't justify returning here unless you plan on enjoying that 2nd star...What is the 2nd star for?? The 2nd star is for the insanely strong drinks they pour here!! &#160;I ordered a crown seven and was happy with the results....very happy. &#160;My friend's Whiskey Sour? Damn fine. &#160;Unfortunately, I don't think they can pour enough liquor for me to say the food is worth your time. &#160;Their is better Thai closer to the other side of Capitol Hill/Downtown and East side. &#160;If you want to leave extremely unsatisfied in your Thai food, then Jai Thai is the spot!!! Cheers! I am afraid to return to this location! Last time I visited here I had asked for 2 stars, my friend 3 stars, when we opened our take out containers NO STARS!!!!! &#160;We went back and showed it to the workers.....Me.... " I asked for 2 stars..he asked for 3 stars.. We get no stars" Them .."blink blink".......Me..."Uh....can we please have some chili sauce?" ....them..." &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;" &#160; &#160; &#160;give chili sauce...... Me....."buh bye " I have not been back since.... I got the chicken Curry Fried Rice... it was pretty good. For 4 stars, I suppose it kind of was if you throw in its hotness from it having just been cooked. 'Had good flavor and cute presentation. Although not the best curry I've had. I was wondering why our plates were chipped, too.Me and my uncle went last night and sat in a wooden "enclosed" booth in the back corner where the beats spun. I like the decor in there; it's really interesting and unique. I think that's something I could look forward to whenever I eat on Capitol Hill again. Toned down lighting compliments just having a relaxed night if desired.The late-night menu seems to short... Wow-- maybe all these other reviewers were there on a different day....I went there a week ago (again!) with 5 other people, and everything we ordered was so good we were fighting over who was going to get thirds of what! No, the service wasn't great... but the food was yummy! I've been to 2 others in this area and was disappointed in both, so who knows? It may just be in what you order.
The service was great. Our host was friendly, warm and attentive. &#160;I ordered the salmon, which was over the bed of jasmine rice. &#160;It was scrumptious. &#160;The chowder was good too. &#160;My sister had a cheese burger and chowder. &#160;She stated it was delicious. &#160;We highly recommend this place. Clam chowder was the best I have had since New Port, RI. The waiter was excellent and recommended crab cakes and the steelhead which were both delicious. Would love to come back.
I would actually give this place a 3.5 stars, but I would want to go back there &amp; like it more next time. Their food is actually not bad for a kaiten (rotating) sushi joint; salmon was fresh (I would highly recommend aburi/blow-torched salmon, if you haven't tried it - you'll have to ask for it usually, as they don't put them on the conveyer belt always), octopus &amp; ikura/salmon roe were also fresh but uni/sea urchin unfortunately wasn't. It's probably good to ask the head chef (Japanese dude) what's fresh on that day.Pros: New, clean, conveniently located to my place, and they have several Japanese people working there including the head chef, but they also have the other staff trainined to use as much Japanese as possible. (some seem to have/be studying Japanesae in college)Cons: I guess they're pretty new and not surprisingly (as it was pointed out by the first reviewer of this place), some of the waiters/servers were not completely familiar with the menu/their offerings, and I have to say I too was served by multiple people which was a little confusing. It will be a while before I go back there, so that I will not change this rating to single star.They seem to be nice people, but no restaurant experience or something. &#160;None knows about their own menu. &#160;They told us to order through the servers if we didn't see something we wanted go around. &#160;So we did. &#160;but nothing came out right.I mean it is those casual sushi after all, but still it was way lower than my low expectation.sorry. Tried this place out for lunch. &#160;Besides the conveyor sushi, they had some lunch box combos which is what I ordered. &#160;One would think that lunch combos would come in a certain order or altogether but that wasnt the case. &#160;The portions were small but food was good. &#160;The had quite a few servers/waitresses but they didnt seem to know what they were doing. &#160;Every question we asked them, they seemed bewildered or not sure. &#160;I guess the place is new and therefore the staff was new..so I've give them a pass on that.Overall, the food was good, portions small which wasn't justified by the cost. &#160;Each lunchbox was at least $13. &#160;You could go to a sushi style teriayki spot and get a similar bento for less than that with bigger portions.Wait staff didn't know what they were doing. &#160;I guess I won't be back any time soon, at least until I read more improved reviews. It was the worst sushi ever had. When my husband and I were there, there were only 5 customers beside us and three servers. But, I never get refill my tea. When I asked one server more tea, she refilled my cup full!! It was very hot and no space to grab my tea. The sushi chef who made our order was not professional. Because my husband is pro sushi chef and was watching how he cut fish and how he make nigiri sushi, and told me there was some tiny bones in nigiri sushi!! They don't even make tamago. Unbelievable!! Also, the price was too high with that quality. We were very disappointed. I've heard good reputations from my friends who used to live in Hawaii. I've heard a lot about Genki Sushi. &#160;I was not disappointed when I was there; I've been there over 4 times now. &#160;The decor was very nice. &#160;The food good too. &#160;I've been to over similar sushi restaurants that are conveyor belt styled; they were all good, but I think Genki Sushi does the best job in comparison. &#160;In terms of the food: Genki has more choices, bigger portions, and tastes better. &#160;In terms of ambiance: sophisticated feel and clean lines. &#160;Service: courteous and professional. &#160;One thing though is that Genki Sushi has big machine that makes rice...kinda interesting... Though my husband is from Honolulu and we have visited a few times, I have yet to experience the "original" Genki. However, I have eaten at other conveyor belt places and I would say this place is decent.We went during Happy Hour with two friends, and all of us liked what we got, except for one plate. When we wanted something not on the belt, we ordered directly with the server and got everything as requested.Unlike other posts, we didn't have any problems with the service/servers. The server we had was nice and helpful when we had the wrong priced plate.In any case, I was not blown away and thus would not drive all the way to Seattle to eat there, but give it the "thumbs up" to anyone who wants to try something new! This place was terrible. &#160;Primarily because of the waitresses service. &#160;The servers were confused about menu items and extremely slow. &#160;Our main server was very abrasive and actually apologized for the bad service by passing the blame to the rest of the Genki staff. &#160;Of course, she was the problem in the first place. &#160;Maybe it's just me, but from past experiences at conveyor belt sushi, the serving responsibilities are pretty limited. &#160;How hard is it to bring drinks and soy sauce to a table? &#160;To order up the occasional tuna roll or California roll? &#160;The only complicated thing might come with calculating the bill... in which case, counting color-coded plates and basic addition can be understandably challenging. &#160;Do yourselves a favor and try to understand that convenience is why people attend these conveyor sushi joints. &#160;We want to sit down, drink tea/water, pull things off the belt, and eat. &#160;We do not need much else. Genki Sushi is a well-established chain of kaiten (conveyor belt) sushi restaurants popular in Hawaii. The newly opened Seattle location is the first on the mainland and is the pilot for a larger national franchise. There is quite a few existing options for kaiten sushi in Seattle but until now it has had a reputation for being mostly sub-par in both food quality and service. I'm happy to say that Genki is well on it's way to repairing that reputation.Our party arrived around 5pm, in the middle of happy hour, and were seated front and center within moments. The servers were friendly and attentive, but just a little befuddled. It wasn't from lack of trying though, I felt very well taken care of, but it showed that they were new and there were lots of weird little errors. Small things like the server not knowing what katsu sauce was, or when delivering our special karaage order, pronouncing it as "caw-rage" instead of the correct "ka-ra-gay". These are not big issues, but something you'd expect someone working in a japanese restaurant to know. Additionally the bar was unable to make our first three choices of cocktails. After a few false starts the server called the bartender over to ask what we were able to order. It was interesting to listen to them talk back and forth about what and wasn't available, apparently there was a problem with their most recent bar order, but this wasn't something I really needed to hear. The chefs were clearly in training as well, which believe or not, I found quite reassuring. There were three or four non-japanese chefs all working furiously along with a Japanese chef who was overlooking their work, and clearly/loudly correcting them whenever he saw an error. The diligent training showed easily in their work as everything that came down the belt looked exquisite. The food was easily superior to existing kaiten joints and in most cases on par with the more traditional sushi restaurants in town. I was surprised at the freshness of the food rolling by, the variety, and the above-average presentation - the food looked very appetizing as it rolled past, which isn't a given in conveyor belt sushi. Everything was tasty and along with standard sushi offerings, I was pleasantly surprised to see many plates that were not something I'd expect to see at a conveyor belt place; things like Octopus balls, Eel, and full hand-sized servings of fried Octopus tentacles, suction cups and all! We sampled as many things as we could without over-stuffing ourselves but the stand outs for us were the crispy shrimp rolls with sweet chili sauce, the crab rolls, the creamy scallop sushi, and believe it or not, the Karaage! I didn't really see any desert items offered although they did have fruit cups and authentic pop-top ramune soda available, which is a real treat!Overall, I was impressed for a kaiten experience, but I see room for improvement. They do so many things right, and it seems like it would be easy enough to correct the remaining glitches.I want to give them 3 stars for service and 4.5 stars for food. So I think I'll settle with 4 stars for now and revisit in a few months to see how things have firmed up. Hmm...how long has that plate been sitting on the conveyor belt?I was asking myself. &#160;I tried to keep watch of what was being put down on the belt and focus only on those items. Finally, I gave up and ordered from the server so I could stop wondering.The food was fair. I have no interest in really going back because the novelty of a conveyor belt simply can't make up for mediocre food. I'm a big fan of Genki in Hawaii. I was surprised to walk into something looking much more upscale than the Hawaii restaurants and I was suspicious until I saw the familiar Genki face on the gift cards (it's not posted anywhere in the restaurant). The servers were friendly and REAL sushi makers, unlike Sushiland (my Genki substitute until now). I LOVE that one of the sushi makers mostly only speaks Japanese and one of the others, Mavrick, is from Waimanalu. They were very busy that night with a big table, but made sure to let us know that they were working on really big orders, but &#160;we just need to ask and they will get us whatever we need. They still have some kinks to work out, as with any new restaurant, and they need to learn how to make a Lava Flow, but otherwise, I really enjoyed it. The ingredients are fresh, they brought the Genki Spicy Tuna sauce with them that other restaurants don't have, the rice tastes like sushi rice and not just rice. I plan to go there again and again...even though I live in Redmond and there are 2 Sushilands and may Japanese restaurants between me and Genki. I lived in Japan and ate my first kaiten sushi restaurant there. Genki in Queen Anne is still the best kaiten sushi restaurant in the US and close to the ones I ate at in Japan.Also, the wait staff definitely is in need of better training. They don't know the menu well and they are still learning the items, but I hope that changes in time. This place has the potential to be great. Sadly, it just wasn't. Both times I've been. i love everything about sushi train restaurants. i love the immediate gratification, i love the variety, i love being able to watch the chefs prepare the food right in front of me. What i DON'T love, however, is room temperature food, and Sushi with so many additives that you can't even taste the fish. The ambiance of this place is great. When you walk in, you are greeted pleasantly, and the sushi chefs are awesomely friendly and attentive. The coloring and decor of the place is really fun, and you almost forget that you are actually IN the QFC shopping center. The first time, our waitress was AWFUL. actually, i don't even think we had a waitress. or she didn't think she was our waitress, cause every time we needed something we had to flag her down, and she seemed really out of sorts that we were doing so. AND, after all was said and done, she didn't give us any of the happy hour prices, so our meal ended up costing 3x what it should've -- (it must've been her first day or something because she actually seemed really scared to be there!)Sadly, the sushi was just not good. Both hunny and i complained to each other that there was WAY too much sauce on everything, things that didn't even need sauce on them. The mayo in the crab in the California roll was almost like soup there was so much of it. They put red pepper powder on the outside of the spicy tuna roll so that all you taste is the pepper. Was so overpowering. the great thing about sushi is actually tasting the fish and the flavors of the vegetables, but the rolls we got at Genki were so masked and made up with outside elements that we didn't get to enjoy the actual fish. Both times, too, we felt really ill afterwards. Not sure if its our stomachs reacting to that much mayonnaise, or if it was that the food was on the belt just a tad too long (they have sensors so that if a plate has been on for too long they must remove it, so i don't think that was the case) ... Wanted to love it, but really, despite the cool decor, i think I'll stick to the fluorescent lights at sushi land. I liked it. Pretty tasty, reasonably priced. There was a good variety on the conveyor belt, which encourages over-eating, but is a good thing over all. In addition to everyday sushi they had stuff like fried chicken bits and those glass bead drinks. The staff was friendly and helpful (we got a lot of attention, but honestly we were the only ones there). All in all, a good experience. I'll go back. I have been awaiting the opening of this restaurant because I saw it transform from an empty, abandoned space to a lovely, chic, clean restaurant. I finally decided the time was right when I went grocery shopping Wednesday night and my butt was too lazy to cook what I had just purchased. The maitre'd was very friendly and helpful. She was attentive to all of my questions. Once I was seated at the conveyor belt I realized just how enormous this space was. There are tables for regular eating, seats at that conveyor belt and tables at the conveyor belt. It is kind of like Sushiland in that regard. It is very well lit. The bar and cash register are tucked away in a little corner behind some bamboo wall. There is also a room for a private party. To my surprise, the food on the conveyor belt are mostly cooked with some raw nigiri but not too many. For anything raw you have to order. The prices for conveyor belt food is much too high for my liking, but the quality of fish is much better than that of Sushiland. Maybe it was the night that I ate there, but most of the dishes on the conveyor belt was $3.80 or $4.80. It is almost better to order and then you get the cheaper plates. The rolls on the conveyor belt were very good such as the spider roll. The chicken kara-age was just okay, though a bit weird cold. The sweet amaebi was pretty good (not like buttah though) and the deep-fried heads that accompany it was surprisingly still crispy despite being on the conveyor belt. The ahi poke gunken was also fresh. The salmon sashimi was presented as 4 thin slices of sake shaped in a rose and topped with a generous helping of salmon roe. For the price that I paid for this plate ($3.80) it was a steal. However, I was not used to sashimi not being a huge slices of fish. Since this place is new, there is plenty of work that needs to be done on the employee side. The wait-staff is nice but there surely was too many employees for a non-busy night. The sushi chefs still need much work because they literally don't know what they are making and refer to a chart that says the ingredients. One chef was practically getting mad at another because he didn't know how to roll the rolls correctly and he didn't know what sauce goes on what roll. I truly feel for the person that was on the receiving end of the food. Their order might have been wrong. Communication between the staff doesn't appear to be so great and they don't look very happy. Hopefully, business picks up and the employees can work something out amongst themselves. Maybe they need to do some team-building... like ropes courses or something. I think I'll have to return here after a while and see if they got their act together. Even though my expectations for this kind of conveyor-belt sushi place are pretty modest, Genki managed to fail to hit this very low bar.First - the good news: the restaurant is new, clean, and attractive. Not at all "cafeteria style" as some of these places can be.Now - the bad news: almost everything else.The sushi was grim. The variety was not terrific. The food that was supposed to be hot was room temperature or just a bit above, and the sushi dishes were uninspired and sloppily put together.Worse, the service was non-existent. We were seating for more than 15 minutes before a waitress came by to take an order or get us drinks; I think they just weren't paying attention at all when we were seated.Blue C Sushi is a much better experience all 'round and much better. We won't be back to Genki again. What? Another conveyer belt sushi restaurant? Yes, I AM from Japan but I had only been to Blue C once before on a date (from hell) and I remembered it being not so great. So, I had no high hopes for this place either.OMG, cute little colorful plates of all kinds of sushi and other unrecognizable (in a surprising, unique, good way) food are going around and around and around...I was totally mesmerized. I was a kid in a candy store.This is SO MUCH FUN!!! Yaaaaay!!!And the sushi wasn't so bad either! Chu toro, sweet shrimp, saba...mmm, and they are so cheap! We stuffed ourselves with all kinds of appetizers, over 20 plates of sushi, and drinks and dessert and the bill came out to be $25 including a tip each. Wow. Wooow. (note: this was during happy hour)I became a fan. Instantly.If you don't want to break your bank, go for this casual sushi dining experience. If you want to spend money, go to Izumi and get really really good sushi. Despite my first experience with this place, I am a fan. I will tell you why....We walk in and are bombarded with greetings from the staff (the entire staff, including the sushi chefs), which was cool at first but became a little overboard when you were seated under the line of fire for an entire meal.The food is amazing. Absolutely amazing. The fish, especially for a kaiten place is very high quality and you could find out of the norm things like sweet shrimp and seattle rolls on the belt on occasion as well as "the norm". The salmon was so delicate I almost didn't even need my teeth and the scallops melted in my mouth - great food!The pricing is very reasonable too.. about the same as Blue C - more than Sushi Land, but the menu is worth it.My only complaint about this place is the service, and I'm still giving them 4 stars because I have faith the the service will get up there. It was explained to us that they were still in a soft open and that their official opening is not til January 23rd. Also, half their wait staff was only on their second day of training and it showed. Oh! And their computer system went down and only one person really knew how to use it. Really, these are all valid excuses for slow service, but I do have an issue when it takes forever to even get water, then the bring one for a party of two, then we place an order and don't get part of it til we are getting the check (we had ordered edamame at the beginning of the meal, asked twice more for it, and then it still didn't come til after we had waited 10 minutes for check). One of the sushi chefs, Emma, actually kicked in and started serving and she completely saved our experience as well as others near us. She rocks!All in all, I will be back... but I will be waiting til after January 23rd so that their service can work out its kinks.... and to try their bar! ;o) GENKI SUSHI IS POSSIBLY THE WORST RESTAURANT IN SEATTLE They charged my credit card for more than I signed for- which is criminal. I will be calling them and demanding they correct it. We had five different servers over the course of an hour- all of which were hopeless. We had one server bring a plate to our table and say "i don't know what this is (referring to sushi) and I don't know who ordered it"- then why the hell are you working there????? We ordered one vegetarian roll and got four. We ordered three tuna rolls and got one. They forgot about half the things we ordered. They continued to screw up our order and were still bringing out the WRONG sushi even after we'd signed our credit cards and were about to leave. They have no clue what they're doing and this place is destined for failure. They made us move from the sushi bar to a table mid-meal because we wanted to order from the happy hour menu (even though we told them we were there for happy hour- and the restaurant was EMPTY)- so the move was completely pointless. The manager made us move- which proved to us the staff were useless from the top down. I told them it was our first time there, we were already eating, and they'd only been open for four days and moving was pointless and inconvenient- and they made us move anyway. The bathroom is 100 yards down a hallway outside the restaurant- and it was filthy. This place is a turd. What a waste! So much potential and they've completely blown it. The manager sat in the corner and played with his Treo all night- he was oblivious to the AWFUL service we were getting. He is the reason this place SUCKS. Pay attention to your customers clown. Save your money and frustration and go to Sushiland across the street. Great new neighborhood sushi spot! You'll notice the atmosphere first in this conveyer-belt-style sushi bar with optional sit-down seating, all in a very trendy, clean, modern setting. Sushi is decent, across the board; the salmon nigiri rocks. Don't expect anything fancy, but you can't go wrong with sushi basics here. Awesome happy hour prices available Mon.-Fri. 3 to 7 p.m. Umi or RedFin it is not, but it's good quality for a great price. If you order from the new monthly specials menu (in June it's been a 4-piece spicy tuna or a 2-piece salmon nigiri for $1!), it's actually cheaper than nearby Sushi Land, and with far more comfortable, clean surroundings and the white ginger, not that icky pink stuff. Oh, and the green tea is free and tasty. This place was appallingly bad. &#160;The only upside is that the last person to attempt to wait on us agreed and told us to go without paying. &#160;How did it get to this point?Three of us arrived around 7 PM on a Friday night hoping to get a good selection and fast turnover were told there were no seats at the conveyor belt, but that there might be a table. &#160;The hostess went to check, disappeared for a few minutes, and then pretended like we'd never asked. &#160;Finally, we got her to give us a table and saw that the table section was almost empty, so how there was a question of space availability to begin with I do not know. &#160;As she only gave us two menus, I returned to her to ask for a third and only after sighing and making me feel like this was unreasonable request did she bother to dig one off the messy reception counter and hand it to me.The menu wasn't much of a help. &#160;If you're going to make up a bunch of your own rolls, they need a description. &#160;The first person to try and wait on us didn't speak English very well and had no idea, so she went for someone else (she also only thought there were two of us, and spent another five minutes getting a third water). &#160;The next person was a little more help, but wasn't an index of everything and we finally saw some spots open up around the belt and asked to move so we could at least pick what we wanted by sight if not description.After another five minutes of re-setting the area, we moved and were ignored for another 10-15 minutes. &#160;This wouldn't have been such a big deal, but there was such a small selection on the conveyor belt we all wanted to order something. &#160;Not to mention that everything that wasn't supposed to be cold was and everything that should have been was lukewarm. &#160;Shrimp tempura? &#160;Cold and clammy like it had been in a refrigerator. &#160;Veggie tempura? &#160;Same. &#160;Fried pork slabs on sushi rice in some sauce? &#160;Freezing. &#160;Oh, and our menus had been taken away again and there were no labels, so it was tough to tell what we were actually going for (not usually a problem, except at a sushi restaurant I expect the fried item in a cocktail glass to be tempura or fried fish or something savory, not fried bananas in raspberry sauce).Also, the only source of wasabi and a soy sauce dish was the sushi chefs, who didn't bother to stray to our area of the belt. &#160;By the time I'd decided that I needed to stand up and yell, another waitress appeared. &#160;She took my order for miso soup and some cold sake (and made a big deal of making sure I didn't want it hot) before dissappearing again. &#160;When she brought the sake back hot, that was the last straw. &#160;We asked for the check. &#160;She apologized, said they were still working out the kinks (they're part of a chain and have been informally open for more than a month...) and that "they'd been told not to put hot food on the belt", and told us not to bother to pay.Somehow, other places manage to serve warm food on a conveyor belt and manage their inventory (bar codes, anyone?). &#160;This isn't rocket science. &#160;If they figure that out, I might be back, but it's going to take a very long time. The original Blue C in Fremont has my heart, but I must admit that I cheated and tried Genki Sushi atop the QFC on Mercer. &#160;The service from the waiter was just lousy (hence the 3 stars), but Genki had a fun mix of rolls that my true love Blue C does not have. &#160;Variety truly is the spice of life; I think I need an open relationship. Went to Genki for a lark after picking up a couple groceries. &#160;I was already selling out Metro by shopping at QFC, so why not betray Sushiland while I'm at it. &#160;We sat at the belt. &#160;A lot of plates passed by before we found something that looked good. &#160;Simple, fresh, minimally adorned seafood - that's what I go to sushi restaurants for. &#160;After a parade of mayonnaise-soaked plates and fried odds and ends, some decent nigiri rode by, and I grabbed it. &#160;Decent quality...no complaints, but at the same time something just as good (or marginally better) could be had for less from Genki's kaiten neighbor a block away.To be fair, if the belt's offerings aren't appealing, you can order from the menu. &#160;If you're not into creamed corn rolls, &#160;just go ahead and order some sashimi. &#160;Personally, though, I don't go to belt-driven sushi restaurants to order from a menu. &#160;I go to grab and eat. &#160;For the times when you want to sit at a table and order exactly what you're craving, there are much, much better options around Seattle than Blue C, Sushiland, or Genki.A minor issue: as some others have noted, that the plate designs are too ornate for the prices to be easily discerned. &#160;This is annoying, but it's not that hard to figure out. &#160;Of course, a simple green, blue, pink, orange type of arrangement would make sense, unless Genki wants confused customers to unintentionally pick up higher-priced "specials".All in all, this is a decent place to stop by if you're not feeling picky. &#160;The staff were friendly, and the food was fine. &#160;It's not bad. &#160;It's just not enough to lure me away from the competition down the street. TURN AROUND AND RUN!!!!! &#160; Got food poisoning yesterday and had to go to the ER. &#160;Ive eaten here before and the service was good but the last few times it has declined. &#160;Especially after this incident. I made two calls to them. 1st call on my way to the ER the employee (male) that answered the phone didn't seem to care much and said "Oh man that sucks" &#160;and proceed to take what we had to eat down. &#160;2nd call to them after the doctor's in the ER diagnosed us with Scombroid. &#160;I told the female employee that answered the phone that the tuna they are servicing is bad. All she did was say I'll look into it and said "sorry this is happening to you" &#160;I would think that they would want our contact info to make sure we are OK. &#160;BUT they didn't... &#160;So they FAILED in my book.To those who read this and proceed to go!! &#160;GOOD LUCK to you... &#160;Make sure you look up how to get the the ER. &#160;I do recommend the ER @ Swedish in Ballard. &#160;The ER staff was extremely nice and helpful. This place was horrible. &#160;Everything was room temperature and had been sitting on the belt for way too long. &#160;The waiter had no clue about the menu and when we asked what things were on the belt he didn't know that either. &#160;I'm not the biggest fan of Blue C, but at least you know what you're getting there. Me and my friends showed up very hungry and eager to try Genki Sushi. It was dinner time and we were the only customers there. The waitress at the door was very very annoying. She explained (at length) that it was happy hour and that we couldn't sit at the conveyor belt or eat any of the food on the belt if we want to order anything from the happy hour menu. And vise versa. Are you kidding me?We opted for the belt and no sooner than we sat down were we verbally assaulted by another clueless waitress and a sushi chef on the other side of the belt that talked our ear off about every single item on the belt, picking up and showing us each item. And this was after we explained that we eat sushi all the time and have been to a ton of kaiten restaurants. They serve Hawaiian style sushi such as hot dogs and spam, which is no way to make any restaurant look classy. Everything was horribly overpriced compared to every other kaiten bar I've been to. We watched the small belt go round and round and nothing looked appealing, certainly not for the price. The plates themselves were not red and green and orange. Instead, they were decorated in designs that were all very similar to one another, and we were constantly referring back to makeshift pricing chart they gave us. There was only one plate on the whole belt that was $1 - an ugly seaweed roll. We happily walked out and across the street to Sushi Land, which was packed with happy customers and as usual offered the best service and the most affordable yet very tasty sushi you could ever ask for. We all had a good laugh about how terrible Genki was.***TIP: Go across the street to Sushi Land Metropolis (803 5th Avenue North, Seattle), simply the best kaiten in the region. Don't waste a single penny at Genki. i just read about this place in the seattle times the other day so i decided to give them a try. some hawaii peeps co-signed on the hawaii franchise from which this joint is the first mainland representative. i knew it was gonna be a lil pricy-er than your typical slum sushi, er, i meant kaiten sushi. i never expect much from kaiten sushi so i came for happy hour with some friends and fam. we were pleasantly surprised. quality wise, it was a notch above sushiland and i didn't hafta speak spanish to be able to order from the sushi guys. we had some kitchen stuff too. the calamari was just legs, more like geso karaage than calamari but still tasty. the garlic chicken is tori karaage with a sweet garlicy sauce. pretty good too. the fish coulda been better but that's how i feel about all kaiten sushi places. still, happy hour prices were ok. rolls are cheap(er) than most places if you consider how many pieces you actually get. i dun think i'd wanna eat here by myself but rather with peeps to share stuff so you can get more variety. this is far from my house so i prolly won't be frequenting it too often. Coming from Hawaii, I have been a big fan of Genki's and was suprised to hear that they had opened a branch here in Seattle! Needless to say I was incredibly shocked, because the atmosphere is definitely not the "genki" I am used to. The decor is very modern/contemporary and gives it a nice Seattle feel. Not too many seats around the conveyor belt, but you can at least order off the menu for your service.The sushi quality is very good for the price. When you compare to Sushiland or Blue C, I'd say you get a much better quality product than Blue C with prices slightly above SushiLand. Service has been either decent to really good and attentive. I think it largely depends on the time of day you go and I attribute some of their problems to the fact they are just opening. The happy hour menu is really good and the prices are tough to beat. All in all, a great sushi place to check out if the mood strikes you! I love kaiten sushi. It's a more efficient version of dim sum with sushi. The downside of kaiten is that some of the food can get rather stale if it's on the belt for too long. &#160;But fortunately if you can sit next to the belt, a quick blurt of "Sumimasen!" will bring a chef over to you if you want to get something off the menu.Genki on the surface is just like any other kaiten in Seattle (Blue C, Marinepolis) but their selection is better than the others. My dining cohorts really liked the spicy tuna bowl. But alas, I did not try any because of my food allergies. Genki has more creative nigiri and rolls than the other kaitens. For example, Marinepolis Sushiland has their cooked salmon with mayonnaise. &#160;Genki has the same, but it's garlic mayonnaise. &#160;It's the small stuff that sets Genki apart from the others. Genki also slots right between Blue C and Marinepolis in terms of price. The quality of the fish is a reflection of the price point, but that's ok when you're just wanting a quick/cheap sushi fix.We came here after 9 for their late happy hour special. &#160;Service was just fine for us. &#160;We got to the bar and within about 5 minutes we had a table at the belt. The happy hour specials were just so-so. Most of the discounted food is in the lowest price category and things I like to eat were not in that category. So for me, it saved me a dollar per bottle of beer and that's about it. Went there for happy hour after reading about it in the seattle times but didn't really end up ordering much off of it. i had some really delicious california roll thing with salmon on top and also some amazing seared salmon. i also had something resembling an unagi roll with sauce business on top that was awesome. my friend ordered the house sake and seemed pleasantly surprised. service was alright, a little confusing because we seemed to have three waitresses but they were all really nice. the plate patterns are kind of hard to distinguish, especially since we didn't actually get the chart. free parking for now in the qfc lot until they fix that bar thingy! woot! Don't take the 3-star rating to mean that it wasn't good. On the contrary, it was! I wasn't blown away (this is no Michelin-starred restaurant), nor was I sorely disappointed by anything. The excellent service (WAY better than Marinepolis, about the same as Blue C) and the cheap happy hour offerings might sway me to a 4-star rating, but I'll have to go back and compare. :)I would definitely come back here - I'd rate this better than Marinepolis, and about the same quality as Blue C, but cheaper! That might just be because we went for happy hour, though. Their house sake was delicious. The genki roll and spicy bomb were both good, but had a LOT of sauce on them. They have some good and simple nigiri like tako and tamago, as well as more interesting ones like white fish (can't remember which kind!) with a dab of spicy stadium mustard on top. Cool! Kind of like a hot dog with the mustard and the salty fish :)There's plenty of fried stuff going around, as well as desserts, which is usually a problem for us at the Marinepolis sushiland that we go to, so it's nice to have more choices in this department. There was also a huge list of specials on the wall/chalkboard with things like seared salmon toro (delish), genki roll (spicy tuna and cucumber - it had too much sweet sauce on it, sadly), toro roll, and lots of other stuff. They had WAY more veggie options than most sushi places I've been to, which is nice. It seems like it's more authentically Japanese (as one earlier review said, it's authentic Japanese fast food!) with things like &#160;katsuoboshi (fish flakes) on some rolls and nigiri. There's also a Hawaiian touch (the chain has like 6 locations in Hawaii) with things like Spam musubi and ahi poke. Mmm!Location is good - kind of a hole in the wall, but if you know what you're looking for, you'll find it. This is a great spot to grab a bite before seeing something in or around Seattle Center, and if you need any groceries, QFC is RIGHT THERE! Sweet. I am a HUGE FAN of Genki Sushi. It is in my list of top 3 places to eat at when I go home to Hawaii (where it is based). I've been a fan since around 1993 or so. I never made my way up to BC to go to the Genki Sushi that's been open there for quite a while now. So when I heard Genki Sushi opened up in Lower Queen Anne I nearly fainted!So me and my Hawaiian-Genki Sushi-loving family trekked our way to find the door to Seattle Genki..which was a little strange to find since you go into QFC and then have to look around to see exactly where what you were looking at from the outside matches to the inside. Oh, a plus - since it is in QFC there's parking! woohoo! Now, why oh WHYYY did Genki have to go make themselves be all swanky, hip, wannabe-Seattle? I anxiously looked for the yellow-faced mad Genki Sushi mascot that is on everything from the plates to teacups to the curtain separating the kitchen from the dining area in the Hawaii restaurants. I wasn't SURE it was the same until I caught a glimpse of it bouncing around as a screen saver on the bar register. If they would have just left it with the normal decor like in HI, I'd have felt so much better from the start. Oh yeah, and where was the chorus of &#160;"Irashaimase!" that always welcomes you no matter how empty or how busy the restaurant was? Other ridiculousness: full bar, waited tables, easily stained trendy menus, individual wasabi handed to you when you sit down (is there a shortage of wasabi that we need it rationed?), crazy designed plates that is hard to tell without good lighting which price it falls under, and clueless waitstaff. Come on now, this is GENKI SUSHI! Supposed to be fun and happy..and laid back (uh, the meaning of Genki)! It felt stuffy and trying too hard. Oh yeah - and I think they thought the picture guides of the sushi weren't fancy enough because they were nowhere to be found. Now, I've been eating sushi since I was 4 yrs old, starting in Japan...and I still ask "what's that" every time I go to a sushi restaurant. Bring those back! So that was the bad stuff... but the good, in my mind, still outweighs which lands it a-ok! The sushi was wonderful! I took my first bite of the spicy tuna and there it was - my favorite sushi place all over again! Because if you're a fan of Genki then you know what i mean. They have a signature spicy tuna sauce that Thank God they didn't try to swanky-it-up. And the scallop &amp; mayo was just right and soooo fresh - something that Sushiland &#160;(where I frequented almost weekly ..before Genki came) could never get juuust right. I was very pleased to watch the sushi chefs (and yes they are definitely the sushi-trained chefs, at least on the night I was there) expertly cut into fresh fish, gently yet skillfully handle the sushi rice and nori. Because, you know, like all true Japanese food - it's an art. And there was one sushi chef who tried his best to help customers but spoke little English, mostly Japanese - awesome to see! And also great to see a Hawaiian local boy chef! Food and sushi chefs get 5 stars in my book. Wait, let me clarify - SUSHI and its Genki Sushi chefs. Their sushi definitely is Genki Sushi! Yay! The rest - well I'm hoping the kinks get worked out and they don't lose out to Sushiland just down the street. Though, I have a feeling they might. The prices start $0.25 higher than Sushiland ($1.50 for the cheapest plate). And, unless you REALLY know sushi or have some sort of emotional attachment to this place (ahem, those of us from HI) you probably won't see why you need to submit yourself to this too-hip conveyer belt sushi restaurant &#160;when you can walk a few more paces to it'll-do Sushiland down the street. Sad. Save Genki Sushi! (Grand Opening on 1/20...so maybe then everything will mesh well!) Oh and I hear (from reviews here) that their Happy Hour is good !edit: 5/17/2009: Service still sucks big time - especially the waitstaff. The sushi chefs are great when you ask them for something - very accomodating. You have to flag down waitstaff to refill your tea or order anything. They weren't even busy. One was lazily straightening plates as they passed her on the conveyer belt. The atmosphere was kind of quiet and as though they were NOT happy to be there. Sad. I do still LOVE the comfort sushi I have grown to love. But only when I have an EXTREME craving will I trek to QA to get Genki now. Plus, they accidentally spilled sauce all over my sister's white blouse and though they did give her a discount off her bill when we went to pay - they basically ignored her (no apologies or proactive response) until we were ready to cash out. I am sad that they are ruining such a good thing. And I think prices have gone up again! Are they TRYING to run business away??? I was stoked to see that there was a Genki here because I loved the ones in Hawaii but I was a little let down. The food selection was not the same, it seemed as if the sushi was modified to please the "Seattle Sushi" crowd. They put a lot of different sauces on their sushi instead of leaving it alone which masked what would be the great taste of the sushi. Also I was shocked that there wasn't any margaro, tomago, and other sushi staples. The staff and sushi chefs were very friendly but Genki reminded me of any conveyer belt sushi restaurant in seattle and not the ones I love back in Hawaii. So unless their menu finally resembles what Genki serves back on the islands then I won't be back. &#160;Bummer :( This is a fun spot for happy hour (although sushi is not the best food for drinking), and they make decent drinks. The difference between pulling from the conveyor and ordering from a waiter is that you have to wait longer for your food from the waiter..sometimes, really long (the staff was newish a week ago when we went). Don't bother getting the tempura vegetables, it comes in a big mass of shredded, deep fried veggies --like a onion flower, but harder to eat.These three stars are mostly for the atmosphere, and the friendly bartender who tried to sell us drinks but was not grumpily pushy when we just got tea at first (while waiting for our friend running an hour late).Note: you have to go through the QFC to get to the entrance. We went there on a Tuesday night after work. We were greeted quickly and seated at the belt. The (almost) empty belt. We watched tamago go by, a few bottles of energy drink, edamame, and garlic tuna. The garlic tuna had been on the belt for awhile; it was a gelatinous mess when I bit into it. I didn't finish it. We watched the orders pile up and the 3 sushi chefs snipe at one another about who would take care of what. Meanwhile, more orders poured out of the machine and the same three old plates rotated by on the belt.No one came by to take our order; after 20 minutes we gave up and asked for our check. It took another 10 minutes to arrive.Go here if you want a cocktail. They look like they have a good bar. For sushi in this area, head to Ohana in Belltown or Sushiland a few blocks away. It cost us $18 at Genki to eat 4 poor quality plates. We stuffed ourselves across the street at Sushiland for $23 shortly thereafter.Unless this restaurant can get its act together (get competent sushi chefs, stock the belt with appeasing plates at high-volume times) then this place will be gone by the end of 2009. I was here with my sons. &#160;I had high hopes since this restaurant came directly from Japan, and this supposedly is &#160;their first store in United States (I heard that they have a store in Hawaii). &#160;When it comes to sushi restaurants, we are quite selective. &#160;We have been &#160;to many sushi restaurants including in Japan. &#160;Here, we quickly concluded this restaurant is easily among the bottom 5 of all the sushi restaurants we ever visited. There were not too many customers when we were seated. &#160; Since there were not many kinds of sushi on the conveyer, we decided to special order almost everything from their menu. &#160;They kept giving us a lot of dishes we did not order, which were mostly Americanized creations. &#160;( chilli flavored sushi-yuck)Almost all the maki sushi on the conveyer looked irregular in size, and ugly to look at. &#160;They looked similar to the unpleasant looking sushi they serve at Safeco field. &#160; The location is really horrible, and far far away from downtown Seattle unless you drive. &#160;I was going to give it 1 and half, but decided to upgrade it since the decor was nice and it was clean. I am hoping that this place will improve since we need more good sushi restaurants in downtown. This was my first time coming here and my dad's second time. I wanted to be optimistic about it, but those hopes were soon dashed. The service was really bad. The wait-staff weren't openly rude to us, but they did not reach my level of expectancy for a sushi bar in Queen Anne. As far as the food goes, it was mediocre at best. But it was conveyor belt sushi so what should i expect.... Meeeeeeh.Thought i'd check it out to see how it compared to Blue C and Sushiland. I came in around 3pm on a weekday so it was really slow, but the staff was very friendly. I ordered an oshinko roll and it was really clear that the chef was still in training--it took forever to make (for one little hosomaki) and it seemed like he used all of his might whilst rolling it--the rice tasted like he had pounded it into submission. I also had some albacore nigiri which was pretty good and some masago gunkan as well. Also, the chef wouldn't stop talking to me. It was kind of annoying. They do have free green tea, though. That's pretty sweet.Honestly though, when i want my kaiten sushi fix I'll just go to Sushiland. It was okay but I'll probably not go back considering SushiLand is just a couple of blocks from here...On the positive side, the place looked very clean and everyone working there was certainly friendly and attentive... my friend and I were the only customers and were out-numbered 3 to 1 by staff. &#160; Currently there's free parking underground but I don't know if that will stay since it's the QFC lot.The presentation here was definitely better than most of the kaiten places I've been to. &#160;Care was taken in plating each item but since there were only two customers it's not possible to say if this would hold on a busy day.Comparing prices locally, they were markedly higher than SushiLand but probably averages out on par with &#160;Blue C and iSushi. &#160;SushiLand is a much better value considering price, portion size, and quality. &#160;I didn't try their Happy Hour but that would bring their prices down to SushiLand's.The fish I had seemed fresh but as with Blue C, some of the sauces over-powered the their flavors. &#160;I personally prefer items where I can taste the fish so simple is better for me. &#160;The serving sizes here seem a bit small too. &#160;It didn't bother me as much but my friend really didn't care for the rice here... &#160;not enough water... rice was a little tough and toothy. Genki? Ie!I heard about this place through a friend who knows how much i love sushi. First off the location, not so great. It was like a stain on the wall, it's so easy to pass by and not notice it. QFC dominates the location of the restaurant. I went with some friends and we were all very hungry after a long day at work. We had to wait for two others to get there before being seated. Why are the seats that are meant to be in the waiting area all the way in the dining area? Our friends were super late so we basically stood around with no knowledge of the "waiting seats". Finally our friends arrive and I assumed we were going to be seated right away since a lot of people had finished their dinner and left while we were waiting. Wrong! Why did it take 20 minutes to get us seated when obviously there were plenty of room around the conveyor belt?I wasn't at all impressed with their selection. Most of what was on the belt were tempura. I prefer nigiri over rolls and the only one on the belt was the seared salmon nigiri. Why do I have to order nigiri off the menu? it should be taking a journey on the belt to my mouth. And what's up with the hot dog roll? Is that a new delicacy in japan? My friends ordered udon and miso which were cold and the portions were incredibly small. The whole time my friend and I were saying we'd rather go down the street to Sushiland.Pros: Seared salmon nigiri, green tea ice cream, and the song on their website.Cons: portions, limited variety, and delayed seating. Genki sushi logo might look like Mr.Yuk the poison control logo but there is nothing Yuk about Genki. It has been my first time at Genki for lunch (found in the QFC) but I am wanting to go back. They have a restaurant area or the conveyor belt,I did the belt. Their conveyor belt has sushi and non sushi items plates that start at $1.50 to 5.00,the averaged is $2.50.They have delicious sesame chicken that was well repaired with great seasoned sauce but could of been a served warmer.They serve Fresh sushi, rolls,shrimps served with their heads on the plates(that's what they look like?) &#160;calamari and great signature dishes.I only been to a couple sushi establishments but I can tell the difference of Genki and it's quality .The Staff is friendly,helpful and talkative . The chief preparing sushi told me that they have a great happy hour with $1.00 fish and inexpensive drinks.The ambiance is modern and upscale but feel comfortable coming in with t-shirt and jeans. I'm torn giving Genki's four stars. The food is easily five stars, but the service is scraping by at a low three...barely. They've soft launched, withe their actual grand-opening coming later in the month. &#160;Betsy's been excited to try them out, so we decided to grab dinner there after work.Walking through the door the staff on the floor all turn and shouted a greeting at us, which was a neat touch. &#160;The neatness does wear a bit then when you're trying to eat and repeatedly have them all shouting over you at the newest costumer to walk through the door. &#160;Maybe that practice should be consigned to the "neat theory, annoying reality" bin.We were seated right away and we both started right in with plates off the conveyor. &#160;Genki does not skimp at the quality of their fish and it shows in every bite. The salmon melted in your mouth, as did the scallops. The tuna was tender and flavorful. Everything we tried was roll-your-eyes good and I could easily go back there a couple more nights just to keep trying different plates just for the experience of them.With food that amazing, it's a shame that the staff is so woefully unprepared for even a soft-launch. &#160;Disorganized and undertrained, It was like being waited on by the keystone kops. &#160;It was comically bad service, with staff asking if we'd like refills then wandering away without actually getting us drinks, food orders having to be placed repeatedly, then asked for over the course of the meal, only to finally arrive with the check. Genki's still gets four stars, though. The staff, many of which were experiencing their second day on the job, are learning and I know that every business goes through birth pains when they first open their doors. Much respect goes to Emma the sushi chef, who jumped in and started working the floor to help the beleaguered wait staff by taking drink orders, tracking down food orders, and getting checks. She single-handedly pushed my opinion from a solid three stars to a hopeful four.I'll be keeping my eye on this place and have faith that the staff will begin performing at the level the food their truly deserves. It would be a shame to not go their and treat yourself to some truly tasty sushi, just don't go if you're in a hurry. Well the snow has been falling for nearly a week now. Day one: Gorgeous, beautiful snow - how exciting! By Day 5: I'm beginning to feel like Jack in The Shining. So I walked around a bit, and ended up at Genki Sushi. The location is right next to the Office Max above the Mercer QFC. One side flanks 5th Ave. N., and the snow looked beautiful from inside. The restaurant is not huge, but a very nice space that can accommodate different-sized groups, and there is even a small bar toward the front. It is clean, contemparary, and bright inside. I was immediately greeted by the hostess with a Japanese greeting --both the host and the waitress were super nice. The Sushi chef, Maverick (you think that's his REAL name?), was very friendly and excited to point out some highlights -- the scallops were a generous portion of very fresh (from Japan) slices. I love Salmon Roe, so practically shoved the whole counter over, when to my delight, a bowl of yellow tuna cradling a large spoonful of roe came prancing down the conveyor. Mmmmm. I have a love-hate relationship with conveyor belts, but the quality was so consistently good, I didn't mind too much here. All of it was tasty, and each piece had something special about it -- the spicy tuna had a dollop of spicy peanut sauce. The garlic salmon was slightly torched and had a delicious sauce to it. My only complaint about the food might be the crab rolls -- way too mayonnaise-y for my liking. But then, still better than the neighboring Sushiland's version of the same dish one block away. I believe the prices for a full meal with miso soup and a beer might be about 5-6 bucks more for an equivalent dinner at Sushiland (my Genki meal with beer was $25 and filled me up nicely). But the quality of Genki sushi, the flavor combinations, and the presentation far surpass Sushiland. I have a pleasant relationship with Sushiland, not unlike hangin' with my awesome kid nephew or something, but Genki steps it up to more that "adult" experience you sometimes crave when you hang out with your buddies. PROS: Good, fresh sushi with nice presentation -- a more "grown-up, classier version of Sushiland. Great value. Open until 12 midnight at least every night! Decent looking happy hour (haven't tried that yet) from 4-7pm CON: If conveyor belts are not for you, don't go here. Oh yeah, maybe the snow IS getting to me, but one thing I can't stand is when fellow yelpers review a place BEFORE they've even been there, just so they can get that oh-so-esteemed "1st to Review". Then, they say they will review it FIRST THING and don't bother. These people can NOT be trusted, elite or not. In my opinion they epitomize everything that Yelp is NOT about, since they are merely lying about their rating for profiile ego reasons, not to share an honest experience with fellow yelpers. How can they rate a place they haven't been to? Because they are liars. Did I mention it's been snowing for FIVE days! Can you see that all work and no play makes Crispy a dull boy? CAN YOU!?!?! HEEEEEEERE'S Crispy!!! The space is very clean, and this is how I feel it compares to the other conveyor belt spots in Seattle:in comparison to sushiland:More authentic--less simple. &#160;At sushiland you get a lot of the plain jane stuff (although the fact that they always seem to have sea urchin brings me back over and over). &#160;Here, you have a selection that is much more off the beaten path, while being very Japanese still. &#160;Sushiland however, is still a lot more affordable--but you pay for that in the fact that you have about 5 different rolls that constantly rotate in front of you.In comparison to blue-c:Again, more authentic. &#160;The prices are a bit closer, but likely a bit cheaper. &#160;Blue-c has a lot of fusion-type things which can really bother me sometimes. &#160;Here, you can request that, but it's still a bit better and cheaper.I really liked Genki. &#160;It's much different from it's counterparts in Hawai'i (a lot fancier and I believe a little more expensive), but they offer Japanese sodas and desserts that you won't find at other conveyor belt spots. &#160;If you order directly from the server you'll get all sorts of different roles and dishes that you'll be hard-pressed to find elsewhere in Seattle.I'll be back!
Someone bought me a fondue set and I tried it myself, let me tell you, it tasted nothing like the Melting Pot. This place is a little pricy but honestly it's worth it. The service is first-rate. We did the full deal cheese, meat, and desert and loved it. Tasted better then any home fondue I've ever had or will have, I'd highly recommend this place. You don't need to spend $60 on dinner at The Melting Pot. &#160;You don't need a cheese course, a main course, a salad and dessert; it's too much food. &#160;I always go with my two college roommates, and we split either a main course or a cheese course, followed by a shared dessert. &#160;For the cheese course at least, the bread and fruit for dipping are replenished to your heart's content, so we always walk away full, each paying about &#160;$13 for food, plus a drink from the bar if we choose, plus tip.The fondue exprience is fun, of course, and a great way to break the ice with new people. &#160;The restaurant has a classy come-here-after-the-ballet feel to it. &#160;The food itself is great; as no-fuss and casual as fondue can be, The Melting Pot turns it into a "happy anniversary, honey" experience.
This is my go-to teriyaki joint for dine in and takeout. I've been frequenting Orange King since my college days. Management has changed a few times but they consistently serve tasty food at a very fair price. Seriously, where else on The Ave can you choose between teriyaki or a burger? Be prepared for a busy lunch crowd cause the college kids know what's up.FYI, you can get a free drink if you check in on the Yelp app! Cheap, large portions and tasty = the perfect student food!The only downside was that I forgot to take my free check-in drink with me when I left! Cold Korean noodle soup on a hot summer day. I love the ambiance, it hasn't changed much in decades.
Everyone else is raving about the $2 sandwiches, which I must disagree with.The rave-able pork, chicken or tofu sandwiches only cost $1.91! &#160;And if you give them a flat two bucks, most of the time they'll give you a dime in change, making it $1.90 total. &#160;That's a full FIVE PERCENT less than these gougers have been suggesting.On top of that, the sandwich comes with a delicious, creamy yogurt dessert. Saigon Deli is the bomb. Or should I say Bahn Mi Chay. Coming from the bay area where you could get a real Vietnamese sandwich from many different restaurants, it's been a shock to exprence the $6 fake ass banh mi at say the barking dog or baget box.Finally I've tasted the legit stuff. $2 bucks. Amazing bread. Jalapeno, cilantro, tofu, and the sauce. Just this would be enough, but the Deli is also a bakery and they have a great assortment of treats like Green Tea cake.Bravo! YUM. Pretty good and cheap viet food and snacks. There are a few other viet delis in the area that are just as good. I remember &#160;the first time I had a sandwich from saigon deli.. it was when I was about 5 years old and we were getting ready to leave church....I remember walking in the door and famished as all can be..... the smell of the banh mi shop was delightful to anyone starving, and under a budget ahaha.... long time ago they had a deal and it was buy five and get one for free... and since my family was so big that deal was AWESOME!!!!! feed a family of 9 for 10 dollars ... really? are you kidding me.... what a steal.. and we had some left over just in case.... since seattle has become more popular with asian fusion, and "the i.d." they changed their location.. they've gone up in price and quality... which is scary to say because it looks like you might need a t.b. shot just to go in there! hahaha jp... anyways, I love their chicken, and tofu banh mi... they are really good, but not as amazing as the banh mi shops in orange county.... damn those nammers in socal.... I swear it is truly little saigon down there.. literally!!!!! anyhow, go here for your new experience of cheap vietnamese sandwiches... but I do like seattle deli more.... but the smell of this shop brings back memories, and really good memories.. they are catholic and will donate alot of banh mi to the volunteers of the church... so if you are cheap and want free banh mi... go do some holy work for the vietnamese catholic church.... hahhahaa.... Oh what I wouldn't give to have a bahn mi sandwich from Saigon Deli right now. &#160;I'd whisk it away to somewhere private, and make sweet love to it with every bite. &#160;My tongue would dance provocatively with the pickled carrots, daikon, onions, cilantro, jalapenos, and pork, until that point where complete and utter fatigue sets in. &#160;Then afterwards, I'd smoke a menthol, and fix my tousled hair. &#160;A bahn mi a day makes me one happy gay! My purcase 3 tofu sandwiches, 1/2 Bahn Bo, 4 creme puffs.My total was $8.75. I believe that the tofu sandwiches are only $1.50 each.They are worth every penny. The Bahn Bo was a bit oily, but I still shared it with 6 other people,and the creme puffs were shoved into my mouth in about 45 seconds.Total cost of enjoyment per person is only $1.25 (if you agree that my friends watching me eat creme puffs was enjoyable) I did share the sandwiches. OMGtofu sandwiches to die for... seriously. There is nothing not to love about an under $2 delicious vegetarian sandwich. My meat-eating compadres say the same for the pork. If you don't like these sandwiches you're simply insane and I have no interest in associating with you. Luckily that person does not yet exist amongst the yelp reviewers (and may not exist anywhere in Seattle for that matter.)
The first warning sign when I walked in Toshi's Northgate; the voters choice award behind the counter from another restaurant on the Eastside in 1993. Really? Nothing good has happened in 18 years? &#160;Second warning sign; you would think that when you order "chicken teriyaki" in a restaurant that has "teriyaki" on the front door would lead to a predictable conclusion that there's a mutual understanding about what is being sold. Not so at Toshi's Northgate. The (very nice) lady behind the counter asks if I want chicken skewers. Things are not going well here. I say, no, just chicken teriyaki, like you would predictably get the other 4000 Teryaki restaurants that are not called Toshi's. &#160;She understands. 8 bucks an order...this better be the best Teryaki that has ever happened. What I opened up when I got home: One half of one breast per order. The chicken; a mix between steamed and par-microwaved. The hint of grill markings could have very well been striped at the Tyson factory. This chicken was devoid of a grilling. The other essential ingredient, teriyaki sauce? &#160;No sir. not there. Maybe there was a squirt of soy sauce to "'marinate" the pre steamed Tyson chicken. Conclusion: in a society where everyone needs to feel like the winner, Toshi's Northgate should not even receive a certificate of participation for what they call Teriyaki. It's so dramatically far from the most compulsory requirements to be called Teriyaki, that they should consider two things: Close, or rename their restaurant Toshi's quasi-Asian Foodstuffs. &#160;It was that bad.Brave the traffic on Northgate, and go to the one next to 7-11. It's really good. I was too lazy and walking out the gym, and I paid the price today. Perhaps it's not the best food, but for me, it's in a convenient location in Northgate, their hours are good, and they make reasonably decent food. &#160;Last night I had their donburi which was decent, but a lot sweeter than I'm accustomed to and chicken curry which wasn't bad either. &#160;I also had a tuna roll which was just fine as well. &#160;This place is decent, convenient, and as good as anything you'd find in the Northgate Mall food court, but If you want better Japanese food in the neighborhood, go to Setsuna. This place needs to be closed down . Ordered 1/2 spicy 1/2 regular tereaki. The lady from the get go was unfriendly. Brought us a dish of red hot sauce for the spicy portion. Then the chicken came out on skewers. Want great Toshi's with salad dressing that's not vinegar and water on iceberg lettuce on a plate before the dry chicken and rice comes on a plate to you. Go to West Seattle Toshi's. We live in Gig Harbor and Northgate sucks- don't waste your time.We come to Seattle to have Seattle Toshi's other then this location. &#160;I walked out when food arrived ,but hubby paid- then walked out. $10.00 of nothing. I would give a zero rating but the rating is 1 false advertising so read other views We are not the only one with a bad review. We should of read reviews before going here...sucks people. Dry chicken. No sauce. If I could give this zero stars I would. Went there last night because I was too lazy to cook. I'd been here before a few years ago and their sir fry dishes were a little more special than your regular teriyaki joint. I ordered tofu yakisoba and was a little taken aback when the woman at the counter kind of smirked when I placed my order. That should have been my first red flag. I took a seat on the bench across from the counter and began checking my email and FB page. After about three minutes, my order was ready -- wow, that was fast. I picked up the bag and it felt very light for yakisoba. Red flag #2. I got home, opened the container and inside were a bunch of dry noodles, a few thin slices of tofu, two -- count 'em TWO -- one-inch florets of broccoli, and one very small chunk of cabbage. The noodles, I am 100% positive, were the same noodles I buy at QFC in the produce section. Even the seasoning was the same. Then I realized, hey, I never heard any stir fry sizzle coming from that kitchen, and I was the only person in the place so it was quiet. I just spent $9 on a packet of noodles that I could have bought at QFC for $2.50. I will never go back here again and will stick to the awesome teriyaki place on Northgate Way, next to the 7-11. Blech.
Yo, the food is good here.. but...Why do they always try to jip you at the cashier.I'm sorry Shady ladies, I'm not a fool and I know you are charging me for pearls in my bubble tea when I don't have any! And you even tried to charge me more of my Banh Mi GA!Again, the food here is good, tasty, cheap..I forgot why I stopped shopping here and its because they are trying to nickle and dime everyone literally!Well anyhow, it's good food, quick and cheap, just don't get ripped off. Good banh-mi, we enjoyed the grilled pork and fish special, both on house-baked bread. &#160;Great value for the money. &#160;It's a chaotic place, large in size but jam-packed with goodies and you have to thread your way between tight aisles to place orders up front and pay on the side. &#160;Downsides - we also tried the fried rolls and a pork meatball skewer - both were cold and meh for flavor. &#160;Cleanliness is marginal, you have to like a funky dive vibe. I love their Vietnamese Sandwiches- particularly the Pork BBQ one. They never skimp on ingredients! Their location is prime too. I would never have to go to the international district and deal with horrible traffic, pedestrians jay walking everywhere and going around in circles looking for parking. The parking lot is shared by other businesses and on a weekend, it could get crowded.Their bubble tea is always made with fresh fruit! Try the avocado, we never go elsewhere for it!But do stay away from their papaya salad. It's not the same as the Thai or Laotian restaurants. I love Vietnamese Sandwiches, and I gotta say this place has the best Vietnamese sandwiches I have ever had. &#160;They also have an assortment of other kinds of foods which are good as well, but I'd be lying if I said I come here for any other reason than to get a sandwich.The prices are also cheap for how good the sandwiches are. Best b&#225;nh m&#236; sandwich money can buy! Get the grilled pork. Bring cash, they have a hefty fine on using debit/credit cards. Amazing Vietnamese sandwich on crispy French bread. I got the tofu sandwich with sprouts, jalape&#241;o and other veggies... Awesomeness. It's a mom and pop kind of disorganized place, but didn't bother me. Definitely going back.
We went here when we were staying at the Hampton since it was right across the street, and chose this place because of the great reviews it got here on Yelp. We weren't disappointed. They have some excellent food here that had a good kick to it (in terms of spiciness).The pricing wasn't any different than what your typical fast food place cost (about $6 a person), and you get the added benefit of eating with real silverware on actual plates... instead of the typical plastic containers. Well, at least when you eat in at the place. Great local teriyaki joint, I have tried many in the Queen Anne area and I wouldn't bother. This is ten times better than Yummy Teriyaki. Also it's actually not bad to even sit inside if you prefer not to do takeout. If your looking for cheap and quick teriyaki this is the best option in the area! We went here because we were looking for a teriyaki place near South Lake Union that had take out and a menu online. We didn't end up getting teriyaki so I can't comment on that. We did get the chicken katsu and beef bowl and veggie satay. The chicken and beef were both good, (they served the sauce on the side which is nice since we were sharing and had differing opinions about how good the sauce was) but the veggie satay was really disappointing, especially considering it was $7. It was mostly cabbage with a few pieces of broccoli here and there and a bunch of rice. &#160;They give you a good amount of chicken and beef in the other two dishes which were only a dollar or two more so my advice is stick to the meat options here. I order the hot and spicy chicken as a suggested by Other yelpers. &#160;Good cheap price. The food came out quickly I ordered the dish medium wow it was spicy and very tasty. I could only imagine how it is regular it will be definitely &#160;hot. &#160;If I order it again I will order it mild. &#160;But this place is a winner they give you a whole lot of food. So you do get the most bang for your Buck. Best teriyaki spot in Queen Anne. &#160;The spicy chicken is fantastic. &#160;Big portions and reasonable prices.
Went for lunch, stayed for 2.5 hours and only saw one other group during that time! &#160;People go support this place, stat!I had Mammanmam curry and it was delicious, good service (maybe a little slow with the check?), overall great place. &#160;Will be back. Five stars all the way!!! The food is amazing!!! Best Thai food in town. It's a tiny place below some apartments off 89th and Lake City Way. I have never eaten in the actual restaurants I always call in my order and pick it up. The restaurant looks really nice though. The people here are always very friendly when I call in and when I pick up the food. I always get two orders of the fried spring rolls, PadThai noodle that costs $7.95 and it is amazing, and an order fried rice with brown rice and tofu for $9.25. The fried spring rolls are the best that I have ever had. I only wish I wasn't out of their range to deliver cause that would make me a happy camper. I wanted to really like this place, but I could help but feel like it was just another good, but not amazing Thai restaurant in Seattle. Maybe it's just that I'm used to eating out on the Ave, in Cap hill, in Fremont and in Wallingford where you can't shake a stick without pointing to 3 Thai places and this is somehow different serving Roosevelt, Maple Leaf and Lake City. If so, then this is probably a 4-star place.It's in the parking lot of an apartment building off of Lake City Way, which is fine, but doesn't exactly set the nicest atmosphere. Once you get inside, it's nicer and you can't really tell that there's huge street outside. There's a nice fish tank in one corner and the place is decorated in a pretty standard nice and cozy asian restaurant style, but seems a bit sterile compared to some other places in Seattle---Jai Thai in Fremont, Little Thai in the U District and Arraya in the U District spring to mind.The food was good and didn't disappoint in the least, which is impressive in Seattle where good Thai food is easy to find. The spicy green beans stood out compared to others which I've had. Otherwise, the food is good, and they have the curries and noodle dishes you'd expect from a Thai place.If you come here expecting good Thai food, you will not be disappointed and the prices are reasonable. If you come here expecting this 4.5-star Thai restaurant to be somehow amazing when compared with the other 3.5- and 4-star Thai restaurants that dot Seattle, you will likely find that it's not much different. This place is great. The food is excellent (try the green bean wok), the servers are friendly and attentive, and the place is clean and pleasant. The only reason it gets four stars instead of five is that the portions are a little small and the prices are a little high. I understand paying a little more for cloth napkins and ambiance, but I'd rather have paper napkins and a huge pile of delicious pad see ew. Even so, Phayathai is absolutely worth a visit. don't freak out about the ugly exterior -- it looks like it's buried under an apartment building. &#160;just park and go in -- the interior is much, much nicer.whatever they are serving here for hot tea is delicious! &#160;the service is fast and friendly, and the food is really fresh. &#160;i ate here with a vegetarian who declared her tofu and veggies to be fantastic, and she's one of the pickiest eaters i know. Pleasantly surprised! Thai restaurants are usually boring and mediocre - especially in our neck of the woods. Location is tucked away into an apartment building with a sign that's in Comic Sans. Not exactly the type of place that you see driving by and think I HAVE TO GO IN. However, once you walk in it's very clean and elegantly decorated. We started off with the fresh rolls with tofu, which were good (Frankly, it is very hard to screw up this dish). Pad see ew had great caramelization on it with wonderfully flavorful tofu and the green curry had tons of tofu and eggplant swimming in coconut milk. Best traditional Thai food I've had in a long time. AND they give you four stars on your spice level when you say they do. I swear, most places get thrown off by the spice factor since I have a Caucasian husband. C'mon...they can handle it - better than I can even.I got a Thai iced tea and my husband got a sticky rice pudding which is something I never want, but their version was nice and had a great texture to it. We also got free complimentary hot tea at the end of our meal, which was a nice touch.Service was attentive, atmosphere was nice, prices were good, what more can you ask for? Looks like we found our neighborhood go-to Thai spot - FINALLY!!! Always good. Always reliable. Always friendly. Amazing Thai food! Love the phad thai with sea scallops, ridiculously good! The Thai Beef Basil and the Cashew Chicken are great! The family that owns this are the nicest people ever. Great ambiance (once you get passed the exterior). A ++++ Ate here while on a trip to Seattle with my boyfriend. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. I eat gluten free, and had the chicken pad thai with no problems. Too bad I don't live in Seattle: I would definitely become a regular here. Every dish I have had here has been phenomenal. This is hands down one of the best Thai places I have been to in all of Washington. Phayathai is a gem and should not be missed. Great service, great food, very nice restaurant. The only downfall is that parking is horrible. Very good Thai food. The spring rolls are tasty, as is the green bean work and the pad se-ew. The best dish though is the green curry with whatever meat you choose. The pad prikking is pretty good too. Been here a couple times, and it's time for a review. The food is tasty, service was fine before, but this most recent visit, it was better! We had green bean wok (delicious, very flavorful, eat w/rice), pad see ew, pad khee mao, i forgot which soup, and a yellow curry. Everything tasted good. Everyone was happy, and after the meal, they served us a delicious tea. Strange location, great food. I'll post more later but trust me, really great food. By far my favorite thai restaurant! This little family owned restaurant makes the best phad thai, drunken noodles and tom kha soup. Don't skip out on their homemade coconut ice cream and fried banana dessert...It's amazing. Only downfall is parking is pretty scarce during dinner rushes. Love it! It's number 2 on my top 5 best phad thai. &#160;Also very inexpensive for the quality of food you get, although they could give you a little more noodles I'm ok with it, quality over quantity right? &#160;Ambiance is right on with what you think when you think Thai food. It may be tucked away on lakecity, but it is worth a try. Came in with decently high expectations after reading the other reviews and to my surprise I was not disappointed. We ordered three appetizers and an equal amount of entrees. Everything was top notch besides the house noodles (not bad just not on par with everything else and very boring). The tsunami seafood was delicious and so was the house fried rice, I would also recommend the crab won-tons, spring rolls weren't as good as other reviews made them seem but were still worth getting. Overall one of the better places I've been for thai and reasonably price. I will be back and you should try it as well.
Even after my first visit here, I was thoroughly impressed with the menu, service, and character of Mulleady's....I can't believe that I haven't been here sooner!The atmosphere has more of an "upscale" pub feel with dark wood all around, low-dimmed lighting, a fireplace, clean tables and nicely dressed staff :). &#160;The bar is fully stocked with a variety of wine (glass or bottle), specialty cocktails (~$9), beer cocktails (um, OMG, they have beer-mosas!), irish cocktails and even some dessert cocktails! &#160;So many options and with very decent prices! &#160; Normally, I'm not a huge fan of irish-food, but this menu surprised my eyes! &#160;They do have some typical Irish dishes (i.e. shepherd's pie, boxty), but even those things sounded yummy to me because of that added "upscale" flavor. &#160;I ordered the mac n cheese (with beechers cheese) with bacon and asparagus, but seriously everything looked so delicious! &#160;Also, I saw someone order the Bread Pudding and that's one of my favorite desserts!This is a great place for families, dates, and parties so I'd definitely recommend checking it out! &#160;I'm definitely going back soon for more beer-cocktails and bread pudding! :) A friend invited me to check out Mulleady's in a few weeks when we both have some time off. My boyfriend &amp; I decided to scope it out since I didn't know how to get there, and stopped by to grab a drink. After 5 minutes of sitting unattended, the waitress came by. We ordered a draught beer &amp; an apple cider. 10 more minutes went by, during which we watched her spend about 9 1/2 of those minutes flirting with two attractive guys out on the front porch. She hadn't even put our drink order in yet.We left, letting the bartender know that if she DID happen to put our drink order in, not to worry about it. I would have given the experience 1 star for service, but the bartender did apologize and offer to comp our drinks so he redeemed another star. I told him I'd be back to give the place another chance with a friend in a few weeks. Maybe I'll be able to re-review and give this place another star or two - I certainly want to, based on her recommendation. But that waitress... eesh. Radical. I'm a BIG fan of this bar! More than just one of only a few awesome hangouts in Magnolia, Mulleady's is a great bar when compared to all Seattle bars. Ideal for big parties and large groups, this two-story bar is quite fabulous. I came here last night for a large birthday party and we took up nearly the whole space. The food was great, the service was great and the atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for, casual and fun! Whether you want beer, a cocktail or some whisk(e)y neat, they've got you covered at Mulleady's. I loved the dark wood interior as it made the space feel really homey and cozy. There were big tables, small tables, sofas and benches. The dart boards and foosball table were always in use and not a single person there didn't have a smile on their face. It'll be hard to go to Magnolia without stopping in here for a drink or three. I have been frequenting Mulleady's for years and years now. &#160;Love it here! &#160;Start with the atmosphere: &#160;I love the dark wood and dim but ample lighting. &#160;There's also a fire &#160;place for the winter, and a small patio area for the summer. &#160;The upstairs bar and dining area allow for more space, and is a great place to hang out. &#160;Mulleady's is family-friendly in the dining area until 8pm or so, then it's 21+ for the rest of the evening. &#160;The food they serve these days is AMAZING. &#160;The menu is seasonal and fresh, and they come up with some DELICIOUS items. &#160;they had housemade pickles for awhile which were outstanding, and the goat and greens salad is always a classic for me. &#160;I love going for happy hour and sharing small plates with friends.There's always a great selection of beers on tap, a wine list, but I usually gravitate towards the cocktails. &#160;They have some incredible ones! &#160;They also rotate these seasonally, and i've yet to have a cocktail i didn't like. &#160;The bartender is fantastic, and he's great at suggesting cocktails to try. &#160;If you haven't checked out Mulleady's yet...do! &#160;It's worth it! Tasty beer, friendly service but the food was average. I got the burger which was a bit burnt and salty. My wife got the fish and chips. The fries were soggy but the fish was fine. We could go back for the beer but not for lunch again.Update: The owner reached out to find out more details. I do very much appreciate that. Upstairs is never open when I want it open. &#160;Their beer selection is good, they represent Big Al's and Elysian well, also carrying good rotational beers. Sometimes the place feels awkward to be in, I can't place it, but the room arrangement is funny. &#160; The food is top notch. &#160;Seasonal menu's with creative appetizers not your standard artichoke dip, and Mediterranean hummus platter. &#160;Great veggie/nut burger, and fantastic entree's. &#160;However they've seriously messed up my food order's before leading to recooking entire dishes while I wait and watch everyone else eat. &#160;Mulleady's is a decent neighborhood bar with a few kinks. It's about time I review Mulleady's! We moved into an apartment on the same block about three years ago, but it took us awhile to try it out. We've been regulars for a couple years now, and it's been interesting to see the changes over time. Overall, we really like coming here, but do have a few quibbles.They implemented a new menu format where most items change along with the seasons, which is both awesome and a touch evil. Awesome because I love places that source local and in-season goodies, but evil because I always find new favorites and I never know if they'll make the cut the next time that season rolls around (I still have cravings for the oaten risotto from the most recent spring menu!).The burger is generally a pretty solid option that I recommend when I bring first-timers here, but we were disappointed when they stopped including fries (or sub salad/soup) with sandwich options and didn't adjust the prices. The fries can be hit-or-miss since they switched to hand-cut fries, too. Sometimes they come out perfect, but sometimes they're sort of on the undercooked/starchy side of the spectrum. Try the duck fat pub crisps (potato chips) instead.The mac &amp; cheese is some of the best I've had in Seattle, and I'd definitely recommend adding whatever toppings they have available. Cherry tomatoes in the summer were my favorite, but the butternut squash they have now is good too.We're usually quite pleased with the service here--Paige is awesome! We also loved it when they were purging extra beer glasses and gave us a set of four New Belgium goblets at no charge!I have to give a nod to Mulleady's for the local beer and cocktail selection, too. I discovered my current favorite beer here (Odin's Gift, a ruby ale), and they also have some tasty cocktails that utilize a good number of housemade infusions (I'd recommend the Jimmy Whispers, a mojito-like creation with cilantro instead of mint). Aged whiskey from across the sea and new, creative food from local sources. It's a very cool, very Seattle concept. And I love love love the space. Dark, cosy, warm with lots of little corners to sink in to. And they have two floors with a full bar on each floor (and a linked POS system - yay for easy ordering and cashing out)!We experienced really slow service from the upstairs barkeep, not from lack of trying but he was fumbling and slowwww. But the downstairs bartender was responsive, apologetic and swift in taking care of us when we let him know of our wait. I can't wait to go back. My boyfriend and I came here randomly when we were visiting friends in Seattle. &#160;It was getting kinda late and we had just flown in from New York, and this place was a couple of blocks from their house. &#160;Boy am I glad that we stopped by. &#160;Cute little pub. &#160;It wasn't too crowded when we came by (might be because it was a Wednesday), but rather nice and low key, which I really enjoyed. &#160;It was the perfect place to chillax with friends and grab a small bite to eat.My boyfriend had their pulled pork sandwich, which he really liked, and I had the mac n cheese. &#160;Definitely get it with the bacon. &#160;I don't know what they did to that bacon, but it was like crack. &#160;Soooooo good.One thing to keep in mind, they definitely like to keep it dark in there. &#160;I didn't mind, but it kinda makes the place look closed from the outside. &#160;So if you try and stop by, but it looks closed, I would go take a closer look. Mulleady's is perfect. We live a few blocks away and try to stop by for dinner during the week, since we tend to come on the weekdays we've never had a problem with crowds. The bartender we usually have is great; he talks with my somewhat chatty husband about travels to Ghana (super-cool), provenance of the beer and wine and even bow-hunting, and at the same time doesn't neglect other patrons. &#160; The clientele seems to be pretty low-key; it is a welcome respite from the hipsterness and frat-ery of Ballard where we used to live. I had my birthday there a few months ago and before 9pm, children are welcome in the dining area near the bar - so my nephew could join in the fun. That said, I don't often see kids, but that may be because I usually come by later in the evening.The food is excellent, especially given the reasonably prices. &#160;We've had the steak tartare, mac and cheese (get it w/ the extras), pan-seared halibut, boar rilletes, duck crisps, burger, cheese tart with foraged berries and crab cakes. I mean, how many pubs do you know of that serve "foraged" anything? In short the food is excellent - the menu recently changed with the season and I'm looking forward to eating my way through it. They sell organic tasty eggs, local from Yelm - like I said, perfect. I would normally take time to explore the very meaning of the word "verbose" in order to describe the place that is a big part of my life, from trivia on mondays to the other three nights a week my wife and I spend here....eating great food given to us by people we now consider friends.I could explain how you are most likely a raging douche pickle if you have problems with the staff or service (you have your opinions, I have mine).I could tell you about the wild boar and mashers with baby carrots that I had last night, which was amazing. I could.....I would........... but it dumped snow today and we played hookey.....and the pub opens soon.So thats it.Thank you, guys. See you soon. I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food at this pub, not your usual pub fare. Anything with their pulled pork on it is great, especially the poutine. The happy hour menu had great choices and at good value. Its really cozy inside, especially on a cold rainy day with a fireplace. Great place. I'll be back. Great jazz/blues music. Amazing food. Had the steak, chef's medium, came with a sprouts salad and hand-cut fries. The homemade ketchup is fantastic. The compound butter is amazing too. The draft beer includes great local stuff (ok, Pacific Northwest), not just the standard Manny's and Mac (no offense to either). The interior is super chill, the lights aren't too bright or too dark, nice place to hang out and read a book or go on a date or wait for it... have a drink. There are no douche bags allowed, no shots, no J&#228;ger. We were there on a night with live music, Sunday, they admitted it was highly unusual, never really happens, but awesome nonetheless. Usually they play blues at a level you can still talk over. I like sweet old fashioneds and the old fashioned gets 20 stars, better than Whisky Bar in Belltown. Don't believe me? Try it. Overall great experience. Glad it's in Magnolia, where some people don't always think of to go, but it's near me. What a nice little surprise this place was. &#160;We were looking for a place to eat and have a few drinks after a photo walk but were having trouble finding something that looked decent. &#160;We finally decided to just grab a drink here. &#160;We found a table for 6 and decided to stay for dinner since it was so nice inside. &#160;It seemed like a real Irish pub (complete with some sort of party upstairs with singing). &#160;The menu was simple but more than ample and everyone found something they liked and everyone in our group loved their food. &#160;The drinks were good and strong, the food moderately priced but worth it and service was near perfect. &#160;My only 2 complaints which don't take away from the star rating is parking was very hard on a Friday night and I wish they didn't automatically add 18% gratuity to our bill. &#160;I know some groups may cheap out but I tend to tip 20% or more but felt since they already added that was good enough. &#160;Overall a 5 star place, thanks for a wonderful evening. It's your basic Irish pub. Great neighborhood pub with real classics and the fire place makes it complete Great food quick staff plenty of room for groups. Over priced food that sounds delicious on the menu, but comes to the customer bland and simply re-heated...I wouldn't mine paying little for a not so good meal, but when you pay a decent amount for food that is simple to make (namely fish and chips) and the restaurant can't even get it right, then you don't go away feeling so great. &#160;Not great food I would say, stick to the happy hour specials and avoid this place for dinner. I have been going to Mulleady's since it was a dive bar where there are now condominiums. &#160;I ordered a burger there recently and left disappointed (and pissed at how much $$ I spent). &#160;The price: $9 for an a la carte burger? &#160;The cheese is $2 extra? &#160;I can understand if the burger itself was outstanding. &#160;It was not. &#160;It was flavorless, greasy and topped with burnt (not caramelized) onions. &#160;The gourmand description on the menu certainly did not live up to what appeared on the plate. &#160;I give this review 2 stars because I have eaten there in the past and have enjoyed other dishes. &#160;However-a pub, Irish or otherwise, needs to have a good burger. &#160;I will continue to have beers here, but will not likely order food again.
Ah, Cafe on the Ave. Food that's not that good, and not that bad. Not ridiculously expensive but not that cheap. Not that fast, not that slow. Mediocre food and value all around.On the plus side, they have free wi-fi, the staff were friendly to me, and they are a convenient place to get a full American breakfast. But I don't think I will bother coming back. Great breakfast burritos!! Banana bread is noteworthy as well. The atmosphere here is perfect for studying or getting together with friends. The food here is a great hangover cure as well. The wait staff are helpful and pretty amusing too. I have been back many times. Mostly for meetings. It is just a much bigger spot and easier for other people to find it.During my most recent visit, staff walked around serving free cookies. That was very nice of them!I think years ago, I would come here and study. But there are two things that make me choose other coffee shops over this one:1. lighting is pretty bad. Good for laptop use, not great for reading textbooks.2. music is way too loud. It is hard to hear what others have to say during meetings.Otherwise, I try to avoid here whenever I can. Food is good, one of the only places in the u-district to serve a decent breakfast. Coffee if good, much better than Starbucks across the street. Quite overpriced though. A waffle was something like $8, much too much for a plaid pancake. I didn't have a terrible experience here. They had a pretty good selection of different types of food which was nice. They have a lot of vegetarian options as well. I also didn't find that the staff was rude, on the contrary, the girl at the counter was really nice and funny. A lot of people were in there studying so it was a pretty casual environment. As for my food it was fairly good, I got a tuna melt. I had asked for no onions but there were definitely onions on it. The fries were good. I wouldn't order it again because there are so many other things on the menu to try. The food came at a reasonable time. One thing I had an issue with was that the soda costs $2.25 and you only get one free refill. That's stupid. I rarely see places that do this and it just irks me. If I want to drink more than two refills then I want to without paying extra, gosh darn it! I think the menu also said that if you don't have a bill larger than $3 then you don't get a refill... which is weird. And stupid. Sorry, I love my soda. If I decide to come here again it will probably be for the convenient location near UW and the free WiFi. The tomato basil soup with a grilled cheese sandwich looked pretty good so maybe I'd try that out next time if they have it. Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside ...maybe the best hashbrowns! Whoa. I was NOT expecting Cafe on the Ave to have a poor rating. I suppose it's up to me to convince some people it's actually quite good.Yes, it can sometimes be very crowded, but it's not constant. I generally go when there is low-to-medium traffic, and I do not have a problem with the noise level at all. Contrary to what some others have said, I have thoroughly enjoyed the food here. It's certainly not mind-blowing, but I always feel satisfied with what I get for the price. Their breakfast items are decent, but I much more enjoy their sandwiches. Also, as an occasional tea drinker, I have enjoyed their choice in teas. They're fresh and certainly help clear my mind.I love this place for talking in small groups of friends OR for posting up at a table with my laptop and headphones and getting some work done.I'm not going bananas over this place, but it's definitely a solid location in the heart of the U-District. I am also actually really surprised by the negative reviews. At night it'll be packed with students studying and chatting but in the morning I have never had a problem finding a spot. The location is also perfect if you're a student at UW, live near the ave, and are just looking for a place to study off-campus. Pretty decor makes me a fan. I got the Northwest Omelet, house baked salmon with onion, capers and sour cream, which was definitely on the pricey side (12.50) but it was still really delicious and filling.They have a good variety of food, with salads, snacks, breakfasts, and coffee. Great vibe in the cafe awesome place to chill do homework and see familiar faces I like to come here to eat and work(like i'm doing right now). I finished my drip coffee 10 minutes ago, and a nice gentleman with a Dodgers hat came up and just refilled it for free. That warm refill was more than enough to make me come on here and write a positive review. Amazing. Huge fan of the friendly service here. I was actually surprised to see that so many people find the employees here to be rude. You won't be waited on, but everyone at the counter has been friendly enough during my visits.One of the main reasons I stopped coming here to study is the terrible wifi. I am almost never able to connect. You can usually pick up the signal from Starbucks across the street, but even that isn't reliable due to the distance.Cafe on the Ave is a nice place to come hang out if you have a larger study group and don't need Internet access. The food is decent, but unfortunately it is overpriced. Try using the PIRQ application if you plan on spending more than $10; you can frequently get a discount of 20-30%. A friend dragged me here - we were looking for someplace to chat but didn't want to order anything. So we dropped in for a few minutes on a weekday night. The place had plenty of spots open and we chose a corner booth.This is a cafe in the best sense of the word, because you can lounge around and do your own thing without annoying servicepeople in your face. If we wanted to order, we could have gone up to the counter and done so. We were fine just hanging out.Sit down in one of this cafe's many booths to catch up with friends, grab some coffee, or get in some studying. Cafe on the Ave works for me. This place has potential to be great. Sometimes they play extremely obnoxious music, the servers are hit or miss, and the food is as well. I would like to be a regular customer here but they need better customer service and maybe clean up a bit more as well. If you're a student who needs a place that: 1. You can study at;2. Has coffee and food;3: Has wifi;4. Has a plethora of outlets and seating; and5. Has late hours (they're open til past midnight during the school year)Then Cafe on the Ave is golden. Cafe on the Ave specifically caters to the student who needs a reliable place to study at, NOT to the connoisseur of gourmet food. The food here is decent (my only reason for not giving it a five-star is because the food is good enough, but not the greatest), but maybe you should go elsewhere if you're looking for mind-blowing food--you really can't expect to have that at a place where students sit and study for hours on end. Admittedly the wifi can be a little shakey (I've had a few occasions where it just doesn't connect, in which case I just connect to the Starbucks wifi), but Cafe on the Ave is by far the most reliable place for a student to study or hang out at--from what I know, it has the latest hours for a coffee shop on the Ave and you can always find seating somewhere, which are the two main problems I've had at the other coffee shops.The workers there are also really nice and usually will make conversation with you while you order. But if you don't order anything and just sit down to study, then they do have a right to say something. They ARE running a business. They serve beer and have outdoor seating. Almost was scared away by the bad reviews, but was in desperate need of a great coffee shop. This IS the sumertime, so no doubt the lack of students helps.Advantages:1) GREAT tables and chairs! Sweet baby jesus they are solid as a rock, unlike the vintage furniture found in most local joints.2) GREAT staff. They were very kind- I did not encounter any rude staff.3) GREAT atmosphere. Music, room temperature, and setup were all conducive to intense studying or just handing out.Why 4 stars? Internet was horrible, had to steal starbucks... This place is is not terrible and not exceptional, very middle of the road with average food and average service. I've tried both breakfast and lunch items, most seem to be lacking flavor. I don't think the cooks season most of the dishes very well, a bit more salt, pepper and other seasonings would go a looooong way. I tried the hummus plate and am pretty certain there was no lemon juice or tahini in it, or if there was the proportions were off, it basically tastes like smashed chickpeas straight out of a can. &#160;The staff are not quite as friendly as the University Starbucks but not quite as snobby as the baristas at Solstice. They are polite enough, just don't expect an overabundance of hellos and conversation (the typical Seattle freeze). This place has tons of potential, great location on "the Ave" and they have a large enough physical footprint to accommodate a lot of people. But nothing here really stands out as unique or interesting. I think they need to kick the flavor up several notches on their dishes and inject a tad more enthusiasm in the servers and baristas. I am sure they always have a crowd given the location to students and dorms but I am hoping for a bit more something out of this place to attract me there regularly. Nothing particularly memorable, but a nice place to have a cup of coffee and, unlike some of its neighbors, it's not always so hard to find a seat. Service has always been great when I've been, so judging by other reviews it must vary quite a bit. I LOVE THIS PLACE. Good coffee, great breakfast. I always order a latte and a breakfast croissant (ham egg and cheese) it's the best I've had anywhere. Also I love that they're open ridiculously late during the school year, I study here for hours when my roommates get too distracting....The one thing I have to admit is it's a bit overpriced and their dinner food isn't the greatest, but this is still my favorite place on the Ave, by far. I've been to cafe on the ave twice. First time was just for coffee, and the second time was for lunch. Both times the experience was mediocre. Coffee was decent, but more expensive than comparable coffee shops, eg starbucks. The food was overpriced and for the quality recieved. My burger was over cooked and my salad was tiny. Nothing was outright bad, nor was it good. 3 stars. good food, good atmosphere, good espresso. overpriced.
I heard the pot stickers were great and stopped by one day for a to-go order. Very friendly, bright atmosphere. The pot stickers were fantastic. I have never dined in the restaurant, but I have been ordering food for delivery from Chef Liao since it first opened and they mailed me a menu. &#160;They are programmed in my cell phone. &#160;Daughter answers the phone, mom and dad are hard at work in the kitchen, and son makes the deliveries. &#160;I have never waited longer than thirty minutes for my meal. &#160;The menu is somewhat hit-and-miss. &#160;For example, the Phad Thai is dismal, and any dish with shellfish is not very good. &#160;BUT! &#160;You cannot go wrong with the beef and garlic noodle, and the crispy walnut prawns. &#160;The beef with garlic noodle comes with two long and large strips of beef that have been marinated and tenderized to perfection. &#160;The meat is so moist and flavorful. &#160;Toss the container of garlic sauce over the noodles, and you will be in heaven. &#160;The meal is enough for two.The crispy walnut prawns are perfect - crispy, slathered in that sweet mayo, and surrounded by crunchy and carmelized walnuts. &#160;It is a VERY rich meal that should be mixed with another dish.Both of those items are from the speciality section of the menu, and I recommend that you stick to the speciality offerings. &#160;I haven't tried the potstickers, but given the reviews here I'll add them to my next delivery! Great pan-Asian, delivered. The grilled beef &amp; garlic noodle is great for carnivores who don't mind people eating off their plates. Pot stickers good as promised. Delivered. Oh yes, dee-livered. In my neighborhood!We've never eaten in. Curiously, we've never been given a menu with our order either. When it comes to Asian food, I am pretty much a Thai food girl, but Chef Liao is reminding me how much I like Chinese food. I've lived down the hill from this place for a couple of years now and was always skeptical of its quality because I never see anyone in the restaurant, that was until I was informed that this place does a huge take-out/delivery business. So my husband and I decided to pop in one afternoon while on a walk through the hood. Not only was the food great, but the price was right too (they definitely don't skimp on the food either). Black Bean chicken and veggie egg rolls are the faves, oh and the fact that they deliver for a $15 minimum makes this one of our favorite take out joints.
We were seated as we walked in. They served chips and salsa as we sat down. The chips were fresh and hot, but the salsa looked similar to ketchup. It tasted good, but it looked weird.Service was above &#160;average, food was delicious. I ordered the pork burrito; awesome. I would try them again if I wanted mexican. What can I say about this place... Being originally from Colorado ('native') and spending much time down in So. Cal, I was on the quest for the best mexican food Seattle had to offer. &#160;Now first off, Seattle isn't known for it's mexican food. &#160;And no one should come to the northern border expecting food from the southern border. &#160;But surely some place has got to have good food around here...So I started going to this place around 2002. &#160;And I continue to come back... even trying the Auburn location since I switch living North to South. &#160;And here's what I've found...Service: &#160;Never had a problem getting a seat even when it's a busy night. &#160;Sometime that means eating in the bar but hey, it's a shorter distance for the margaritas to travel. &#160;The staff is attentive and makes you feel like you're at a mexican olive garden ('Where you're family').Food: &#160;Again, my search has been to find the best mexican food. &#160;The way I test it is by ordering a standard which is Chile Verde. &#160;It's a dish that just about every true mexican restaurant should know how to make and make well since there isn't much to it. &#160;Being from Colorado and living a good bit of life in the southwest, if the food doesn't compare to what you'd get down south, it's a fail. &#160;This place wasn't. &#160;The food was authentic in taste and appearance. &#160;The rest of the menu is also excellent and well portioned even for hungry eaters. &#160;Ratio of entree to rice/beans is about 60/40.Price: &#160;Very reasonable. Good family style Mexican food. Like Azteca but family owned and better. Muchos carne in their fajita. They have good chips and salsa. The drinks are too sweet. The service is either okay or bad. I go here because it is close to my house and usually when I'm hung over. Stick to the basics and what you know. The arroz con pollo is too sweet. The carne asada is paper thin and not very well seasoned. Nothing special here and this is very annoying when it comes with the attitude of some of the servers.
This review is based on their fried chicken wings and tapioca ONLY.I frequently crave fried chicken at night. &#160;It's a terrible, terrible sickness. &#160;Although I have significantly cut down on how often I eat fried chicken, sometimes I just can't shake the craving. &#160;Plus, I cook very healthy meals. &#160;Everyone deserves a splurge.I used to go to the ID for chicken wings, but those days are now over. &#160;Mee Sum has amazing wings. &#160;They're not salt and pepper, but they are spiced very nicely. &#160;They are EXTRA crispy, too. &#160;Delicious! &#160;Not too salty and extra crispy. &#160;The chicken was very, very moist on the inside. &#160;I like the portion too: 8 pieces. &#160;I usually share with the BF, so four pieces of chicken doesn't seem too artery clogging.The jasmine tea tapioca was not very sweet and I really like that they have a soy option. &#160;Creamer is just too rich for my palette. &#160;Their tapioca balls are also the best I've had in Seattle, soft and sweet.It's very bad news that I have found Mee Sum's amazing chicken wings.. Yesterday I ordered delivery from Mee Sum and I have been debating whether or not to give them 2 or 3 stars. The reason why I went with 2 is because my boyfriend who ate with me got sick. I am not and cannot imply that it is strictly from the food since I did not get sick, but I did eat less and this may be why I was spared.We ordered salt &amp; pepper squid, sweet &amp; sour pork, and BBQ pork appetizer slices. The total was around $27 dollars. My favorite of the three is the salt &amp; pepper squid, but it's definitely not the best I've had. Chinatown has fed me a better version of this. The appetizer was not much and the meal did not come with rice which took me off guard. I believe if you want rice, it's a few dollars extra. I did not pay extra on the assumption that If I am paying 9 dollars for a dish, there is rice. &#160;I will probably come back for the squid since they deliver (took about 1 hour), but to be honest, my meal was mediocre. Needed something sweet to eat/drink after brunch today. Meesum never lets me down. My ultimate favorite drink is hot Japanese Style Milk Tea with no sugar and tapioca. It's sweet enough already. I even got my boyfriend hooked on this drink. It's good iced as well. My second favorite drink is Matcha Green Tea Slush with tapioca, which is great for hot summer days.Meesum also offers hombows and meals. I like the beef curry hombow and their popcorn chicken meal the most.FYI they charge you $0.25 extra if you use debit/credit card when your total is less than $5. Bring cash. Mee Sum is a place i will go when i crave for some quick delicious bites or bubble tea. They do not serve the overtly-sweetened Americanized bubble tea frequently found around the U, but authentic bubble tea you will find in Asia. I love the milk-tea based bubble teas, and the fact that they serve a great variety of them. The snacks and meals are pretty reliably good, although depending on how crowded the place its, the wait can be long. I find the Humbows, popcorn chicken, and the noodle soups to be all consistently good and reasonably priced. To start with, Mee Sum has never been my go-to place for bubble tea on the Ave, but I've been there enough times to say that the drinks deserve a solid 3 stars. Now you may wonder why I've only given this review 2, that's because my experience there today just kicked one of the stars out of the group. And here's why. I ordered a warm jasmine milk tea with tapioca, and the wait for my drink to be made took unusually long. Once my drink did come out, it was made cold and not warm. When I asked the worker about it, she said that I had not ordered a warm drink and that it was MY mistake (this is false). I am 101% sure I ordered the correct drink, but even if she did not hear it, I would expect for the business to just accept the misunderstanding and make me a new drink. Since I didn't want to wait along any longer or take the time to argue my case, I just left with the cold drink.The drink itself is pretty good, although most of the drinks I've gotten there have been a hit or miss. The tapioca consistency was a little tough, but the sweetness was perfect. Overall, Mee Sum will continue to not be my go to place for bubble tea, but I will not forever shun it. I may stop by again some day. Very decent Boba (Bubble Tea) and fairly quick service. &#160;Mee Sum's a nice place to catch a quick snack like a croquet or hang out or study a little bit. &#160;I would definitely recommend trying the Naked Panda! &#160;The strawberry boba are also pretty amazing. &#160;They're cased like normal boba but pop in your mouth and release a strawberry juice. &#160;I really like the popcorn chicken and the chicken curry is pretty good as well. &#160;I honestly haven't had too much off the food menu but from what I have had there I would definitely recommend it to a friend. $2.26 for delicious Humbows!!! &#160;BBQ and the Chicken with vegetables are my faves. Avocado milk shake was yummy. Free-Wifi. Should have added tapioca. Only minus was the somewhat obnoxiously loud U students next to me, talking about blacking out on nights out and dropping casually racist parlance without a second thought.
De-lish....As far as thai food goes, this is pretty up there in spice...crazy up there, but only if you ask for it. &#160;I had the phad thai (I always get it if you want to make a general judgment about a thai place, the phad see ew, and the panang curry, all of which was pretty good. &#160;The service was excellent, it's pretty difficult to find a place in chinatown where they're good about refilling your water, and it has been my longtime benchmark for rating good service. &#160;This is probably not worth noting, but they have good after dinner mints... Just hopped in to try something new.We had the 7 flavor beef and Pad Kee Mao? They both were ok, pretty typical dishes, nothing stand out, which isn't a bad thing. We did order 5 stars which was pretty hot for a couple fire bellies. So unless you breathe fire you might wanna not go overboard on the stars!Give em a shot Ok,. dont ask "on a scale for 1 to 5 how hot do you want your ....." when you arent going to listen. It was all liquid magma. &#160;We both ordered on the lower echelons on the scale and got burned. &#160;I would have loved the place, if I could have tasted my food... while it was simmering in my friggin mouth.... on fire.... in fact, not even joking, I thought of that guy from Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark, who had his face melt off.. I was him. The good: it is in the International district The bad: We said we didnt want it hot.. that was the opposite of not hot.Thanks I've been to Tropics three or four times now and have always ordered pretty much the same thing - sweet &amp; sour chicken or sweet &amp; sour prawns. I love their sweet &amp; sour beef/chicken/prawns (your choice) because it's stir-fry style, instead of breaded and deep friend. You get lots of sweet &amp; sour 'broth', but it's not heavy, overly sugary, or greasy. You basically get a plate of delicious stir-fried veggies and meat swimming the the perfect amount of broth, served with a huge scoop of white rice to soak it up, and a side salad with creamy, spicy peanut dressing. all of this for $7-8 depending on your choice of meat.I personally love the service here, it's just my style. The waitstaff are quick to notice when you look up for assistance, but otherwise they leave you alone and let you eat in peace (aside from one obligatory "is everything okay?"). &#160;This place gets pretty busy during lunch hour, mainly because it's less than two blocks away from Sound Transit, http://Amazon.com, and a number of other business offices, but if you get there by 11:45 or so, you'll have no trouble getting a table. Location is great - a block and a half from the International District Station of the Transit Tunnel (light rail and buses), so it's easy to get to-and-from if &#160;you work anywhere in the downtown Seattle core. This place has a fabulous curry fried rice and mussamun curry.We go there for lunch all the time. The service is also really good and the staff is friendly. People walking around the International district don't realize this restaurant exist. A lot of people don't give this restaurant a chance. I like this place it has very good food, good service and very few customers why is that? My favorite dish here is the Tropic Fried Rice although its an ordinary dish but very delicious and it is spicy I would recommend getting a 1 star for those who don't eat spicy. The inside has a simple decoration which appeals to customer and the place is clean not like most restaurant around the ID. The only downside is the parking its quite a hassle.
First impressions are everything in this business. &#160;My first 2 impressions weren't great, but I guess the third time's the charm. &#160;When I finally got in to try the food, I forgot all about the weird phone experiences...it was just that good. &#160;Also, Michael at the door was wonderful and welcoming, and our server Cherise was perfect. &#160;I'll definitely be back...but maybe I'll stick to online reservations. The owners of the Queen City Grill and Il Bistro have combined with &#160;Michael Rico of El Gaucho to open this antique-inspired cozy Italian seafood delight. With names such as these on the list, and Chef Ashley Meriman, formerly of Tilth heading up the kitchen, my palette is sure to be pleased. I love a place that is small, but still makes even thier cheese from scratch. Their house made mozzarella sounds wonderful- I will be sure to try it. Readymade ingredients in thier kitchen are usually local, such as salted caramels from Fran's Chocolates used in the semifreddo dessert. Can't wait to try that!An update is soon to follow after my rendezvous with the new Branzino in Belltown, opening today (June 4, 2008). Not sure why there are 3 separate entries for this new restaurant, but guess I will add my review here. &#160;Had read Chris B's review earlier in the week and then just so happened to be doing the Thursday night wine tasting at Seattle Cellars (a must do!) and were deciding where to go to dinner when my friend looked out the window and asked, "hey, is that place new?" &#160;I looked up and realized we were right across from Branzino. &#160;Let's check it out! &#160;There were several empty tables and spaces at the bar so we were seated in a window booth without a problem. &#160;Service throughout the evening was stellar!! &#160;Honestly, 5 stars. &#160;Our waters were never empty, our wine glasses always topped off and our server even went so far as to run down the street to procure a decaf cappuccino for my friend since their coffee machine wasn't hooked up yet (only day 3 of them being open). &#160;We decided to share everything between the three of us so we ordered the romaine and panzanella salads to start. &#160;All of the dishes are a good portion for a single diner, so we just got small tastes of each thing, which was sufficient. &#160;The Panzanella salad was a bit more like a caprese salad, but was still delicious since I love tomatoes and mozzarella. &#160;(Important note: &#160;according to our server they make all their own cheese and pasta and they have their lamb sausage made from a special recipe for them in the market). &#160;For the entrees we selected the gnocchi, pappardelle and the lamb sausage. &#160;The gnocchi with snap peas, lobster and truffle oil was my favorite, so light it melts in your mouth with the lamb sausage coming in second. &#160;I am not a huge dessert person, but they had me at peach pie...the crust was so light and flakey and the vanilla bean ice cream was the perfect partner. &#160;The peaches were still crisp....ahhh....I am still thinking about that dessert...yum! &#160;They don't have a dessert menu printed up yet, but I believe they should have one in a few days...I think they had 3 (maybe 4) selections. &#160;The space is on the smaller side...cozy with dark wood booths and walls. &#160;The north side is full of windows so they provide a great amount of natural light. &#160;The bar looked like a great place to grab a drink and catch up with a friend.The wine list is still developing, but we had a nice bottle of one of the Italian varietals. &#160;The staff is already well versed in the menu of this great little new place and were happy to share their favorites and recommendations. &#160;Entrees aren't super spendy...pastas ranging from $14 and up, some of the meat entrees are a bit more (though our lamb sausage was only $19 I believe) but the wine definitely put our cost per person into the $60 range.I highly recommend checking out this great new Belltown spot. &#160;It's not Tavalota, but I think this place will shine on it's own. &#160;Ladies...watch your step going to the bathroom...there is a small unfinished part before entering...hoping that will be fixed as they wrap up all the finishing touches on this place. To pull off five starts in my book on opening weekend gets me excited.Why:Great vibe, the interior is warm, but sheik, good for Belltown. &#160;It was chilly out so the warmth was nice. &#160;On a bright sunny evening, this wont be such a great pick. &#160;Anyhow, at 10pm on Friday night the place was popping.The services was amazing. &#160;They may be over staffing for the opening, but thanks for that. &#160;Even the creepy guy who brought spoon over for us (I was a little worried he had been licking in the back, weird.)The food. &#160;Wow, we had planed on just drinks, but after reading the menu, hadta hadta. &#160;The gnocchi with lobster (real fresh lobster) was amazing. &#160;I had asked the server to bring with would delight and it was her choice.Welcome to the neighborhood Branzino, I look forward to getting to know you better. I was here for opening night, recommended by my friend and neighbor who just last week moved to a new apartment. &#160;Ahhh, sadness. &#160;But he also got a new job cooking at... yes, Branzino! -- which is great, because otherwise I wouldn't have known about this place for probably another six months. It was downpouring the night they opened, so my date and I got pretty soaked -- which is fine by me -- I love that REAL kind of rain we get so little of her in Seattle. &#160;But I'll take that over cold pin-pricky drizzle anytime. &#160;:) &#160;But I digress. &#160;We got a bit lost finding the place, because the restaurant as of now has no real signs demarcating that this is indeed Branzino, but after circling a couple of blocks, we stumbled upon it. &#160;So in case this happens to you, just shoot for 2nd and Wall in Belltown.The ambiance was surprisingly alive -- the restaurant was already filling up quickly, and there were a number of people milling around the small bar in front. &#160;There is a nice mix of open kitchen where you can watch cooks on the line preparing plates alongside the bar, and classic yet contemporarily simple dark-wood interior. &#160;This restaurant is not huge - maybe ten tables, but somehow they pack a lot into the space, and it really works. &#160;Even though we were seated near a busy intersection toward the front of the restaurant, I did not feel the least bit annoyed by it, and enjoyed the atmosphere of people-watching. &#160;Ok, so as our friendly wine steward put it -- it's all about the food here -- so the question then remains -- how IS it? &#160;The food here is dynamite. &#160;They really nailed it, from presentation to flavor to texture -- the food was excellent -- and on their very first night, no less. &#160;Thus the five star rating.My date and I had, collectively, the following: &#160;A bottle of Pinot Noir (we asked for a recommendation appropriate for the downpour going on outside, and our wine Steward came through with the perfect pairing for that.); Romaine with Anchovy (aka Caesar Salad -- but I like how the menu simply and concisely describes the ingredients of the dishes -- it makes me hungry just thinking about it -- very user friendly menu!); Mozzarella antipasti (The chef here makes her very own in-house mozzarella, and it really shows -- very good flavor, light and fresh, yet dense.); a colorful Panzanella (Bread salad); Lobster Gnocchi (very lobster-y with large and small chunks of lobster meat; Lamb Sausage in yellow tomato sauce; Sea Bass, only replacing the Sea Bass with Halibut (How could they "run out" of Sea Bass (which is the namesake Branzoni in Italian) -- in the first two hours of the opening day?). &#160;Hmmmm... ok. &#160;Well, let me say that that generously portioned Halibut fillet was divine with that Sea Bass preparation -- juicy, with a perfectly seasoned crust on the outside, yet flaky in the middle, and mated ideally with the grapes and nuts. &#160;Just wonderful. &#160;The only complaint I can drum up for the food is that the Lamb sausage was just a bit too salty for my taste, but otherwise the sausage had a rich, deep flavor and sauce, and looked great in it's presentation. &#160;I mean, how to you get SAUSAGE to look GOOD on a plate? &#160;They figured it out, somehow.Most of the servers were very good -- taking care of problems as they arose, and most were very polite and pleasant to chat with. &#160;However, there does appear to be some service kinks to work out. &#160;It took us 15 minutes after we sat down to even be acknowledged, let alone get wine and give our food order. &#160;Also, they didn't deliver the salad dishes together -- but since we were sharing, anyway, this was not a big deal. &#160;My date and I already knew what we wanted to order after salivating at the menu for a while, so we felt that now that we had our server's attention, this was our chance to give her our entire order in case she did not come back for a while. &#160;And while it was obvious we were neglected for some time, it wasn't even acknowledged by her, really -- as if that's normal. &#160;We saw very little of her over the course of the evening, as maybe 4 or 5 other servers graciously attended to us in some form or another. &#160;All the support service (the wine steward, the water, place settings, etc) was exceptional, and somehow our water glasses and bread got refilled -- as if by magic. &#160;Strange but good. &#160;Anyway, my guess is they are still trying to work out the service kinks, so it would not be fair to mark Branzino down more than one star for one server's neglect among an otherwise very high standard.The desert menu was surprisingly full and creative, but we were simply too busted to eat any more, so we passed it up -- something to look forward to next time.Our total bill (food and wine) came to about $130 for two of us, plus tip -- so Branzino is fairly consistent with what you could expect for a nice evening dinner out, and it is worth it.PROS: &#160;Excellent, simply prepared Italian food in pleasant environment.CONS: &#160;Service kinks I've been an inordinate number of times given how new it is, but it's just THAT good!The food is innovative and delicious, the ambiance is posh yet cozy, and the scene is just right. &#160;A touch of swank, but mostly down to earth. &#160;What keeps it the latter is the service. &#160;I've been recognized as a "regular" and treated so very special. &#160;The waitstaff are knowledgeable and friendly, and you get the sense the management really believes in this spot.Try the truffled lobster and snap pea gnocchi or the fish served "in paper". &#160;Also the pizza is KILLER! &#160;I dreamed about it for weeks after.Definitely put it on your list. &#160;After that, I know you'll be back. &#160;It's a place in Bell Town with some soul! I was amazed how many good reviews there are for this restaurant when I went there and found out it has only been open for a week or so (more reviews for this place than some popular restaurants open for a couple years!) &#160;It appears the staff has done a good job with word of mouth advertising, or we have some stacking of the deck potentially going on here? With that being said. &#160;Here's the scoop. &#160;This place is run by and frequented by primarily twenty somethings. &#160;Every person working in the restaurant looks like they are in their early twenties. &#160;And 80% of the patrons looked to be the same. &#160;Not that this is a bad thing necessarily. &#160;But it could explain all the initial hype. &#160;I took a friend there for his 40th birthday. &#160;It was fairly crowded but we easily got a table on a Thur night with no reservation at about 7:30. &#160;There are several aspects to this restaurant that indicate the owner(s) are trying to take as little risk as possible. &#160;The first thing I noticed is that the booths are these uncomfortable, sit up straight, hard wood benches. &#160;They appear to have been custom made from cheap wood and stained to save cost on furniture. &#160;Also a close inspection to the finishing details of the restaurant and the bathroom reveals they really tried to keep costs down. &#160;The atmosphere is pleasant but rather simple/stark and as I said, upon close inspection, cheap.The Wine List is limited, again indicating to me that the restaurant is running on a low budget and they did not heavily invest in a large wine selection. &#160;We had a bottle of Italian wine for $45 and two glasses of Malbec. &#160;Both were terrible. &#160;So wine list is limited and overpriced in my opinion. &#160;This may be one downside to a young staff. &#160;How much wine knowledge can a Wine Steward of 22 years old have? &#160;Well maybe in some cases a lot. But not in this case. &#160;He may have not been the buyer though. &#160;I can see it now, the buyer wanting a "deal" from the distributor, so to save cost they got a bunch of crappy wine. &#160;But then again, we only tried three wines (two reds, and a sparkling which was good) &#160;The restaurant lacks a significant selection of dessert wine too.The food is very hit or miss here. &#160;I suspect most of these reviews, assuming they are legitimate and not just staff and close friends of staff, are those people that either lucked out on their choices or had a few dishes that were outstanding enough to overshadow the mediocre ones. &#160;We tried a couple appetizers and a couple entrees. &#160;Like I said it was hit and miss. &#160;This is not surprising though for a new restaurant. &#160;Actually impressive if you consider the kitchen staff is a bunch of 20-somethings but anyone can follow a recipe.The restaurant is to be commended for its service. &#160;The service was good. &#160;Some wait staff are a sight for sore eyes. &#160;Service was prompt but not overbearing. &#160;Everyone was pleasant and upbeat - but this is too be expected when the restaurant is 80% full and its your first week in business. &#160;Most importantly our server was very interested in our feedback on all the food, assuming they are compiling patron's feedback to make adjustments and improvements. &#160;A definite must if you are going to have any chance of survival in the restaurant business especially in this economy.Overall I wouldn't steer someone away from trying this place at least once. &#160;It's strength is in its upbeat, youthful atmosphere both in the staff and the patrons. &#160;I had a feel that paying attention to the food was taking a back seat to just enjoying each other's company in most of the booths. &#160;Which is as it should be. &#160;So I would give the VIBE of this place 4.5+ stars. &#160;And I think that may be coloring people's memories of actually how good the food is, or it also just may be the younger crowd can't afford to be eating at other places like the Dahlia Lounge every week so relative to what they are used to, this place has good food. &#160;(Nor can I, but age and travel have given me much experience in many many restaurants.)I would give some of the food 2 stars and some of it 4+ stars. &#160;But the back breaker, literally, was the cheap, no frills furniture. &#160;The booths aren't THAT bad if you aren't going to do a long, leisurely dinner. And if you have good company maybe you don't even notice you're essentially sitting on an almost 90 degree wedge of plywood.In 4-8 months, after summer has past, this place will be out of business once the hype subsides, or it will be rockin' and you'll need reservations. &#160;It's one of those places that really can go either way. &#160;In this economy I'd say they have an uphill battle.Service - 4+ StarsAtmosphere - Vibe 4+ stars, furnishings 1 starFood - 2-4 stars depending on what you order Overall 3.5Price - 3.5+ stars, food prices lower than most similar downtown restaurantsWine List - 2 stars Branzino opened last night, and I was lucky enough to get a reservation and taste their delicious Italian fare. &#160;The focus here is definitely seafood (a Branzino is a small fish) and the lobster gnocchi with snap peas that I enjoyed demonstrated a thorough understanding of how to best prepare delicate and sumptuous dishes. &#160;Anyone who has attempted to cook gnocchi can certainly appreciate how challenging it is to get the right texture out of your finished product. &#160;Not only was the gnocchi pillowly and pliant, but the snap peas were pop-in-your-mouth crisp. &#160;I do wish that for a $20 something dollar entree there had been a bit more lobster, and I finished the entire plate -which is uncommon for me.This was definitely an opening night, with unfinished construction in the bathrooms, strange placement of some chairs and lack of lamps (the dark hallway to bathroom) and lack of branding on the menus. &#160;The wine list leaves a bit to be desired for the by-the-glass selection, but I imagine they might not have a sommelier on the staff at this point.Overall, I had a nice time and I think this restaurant is what this quite block kitty-corner to the McGuire apartments, needs. &#160;I'll go back, this is a great place for a date and what I experienced was hopefully the beginning of a lasting place for Branzino in Belltown. This place was great! &#160;Nice atmosphere and environment with a friendly staff, good bar and wine list, and most importantly good food. &#160;We tried the pizza, lobster gnocchi, and the pasta bolognese, and chocolate cake (with vanilla milk). &#160;All tasted very good and very fresh. I was told by the staff that the bulk of the food and ingredients are made from scratch daily.This is one of the places in Belltown that I really want to stick around! It's coming along. I stopped into Branzino the night it opened because I live upstairs and have been waiting a long time for something useful to fill this space...They went pretty simple with the decor. I guess simple is better. My girlfriend and I just wanted drinks...but the specially made barstools were still being specially made - so we took a table and ordered food and drinks. Wine: yum. Food: yum. I went again the other night with my fiance who's pretty high maintenance with food restrictions and Ashley Merriman catered to his every whim! Yay! for girls rockin' the kitchen!I heart Michael Rico, love the wine list, and hope Branzino has a long lasting life at 2nd &amp; Wall. I want to give this place a 5 for so many reasons. Biggest reason? There was this amazing pasta dish with rabbit and morel mushrooms that had hubby reaching across the table with bread to get the very last bits of the sauce from the edge of my dish. The staff was great, and the owner came over a couple of times to check and see how we liked our meals. The wine list had lovely selections without being pretentious. I wasn't overly impressed with the heirloom tomato salad, mostly because it was listed as having mozzarella, but only had very small cubes that were difficult to spear with my fork. I was also sad that many of their cocktails weren't available, as their house made liquor infusions weren't ready yet.I will definitely make it over here to try round 2 when we go back to Seattle.
We have actually eaten here many times over the years and (full disclosure) happen to be one of the families that have kids that come here. &#160;WE WILL NEVER BE BACK. &#160;We ate there with another family tonight and my 4 year old was apparently out of his seat too often. &#160;A man at a different table yelled at him until he cried and then literally grabbed the young boy he was with by the neck and shook him. &#160;After I pulled this man's hand off the child's neck and tried to soothe my crying son we asked for the check to leave. &#160;The bartender thought it was important enough to come by before we left and let me know "it was probably more of the kids fault" as they "were running around the place."If you think your kids may get up and run around or play with the toys and you don't think that should get them grabbed around the neck..... maybe skip itEden My husband and I, our two kids, and a few friends were at Madrona Ale House Sunday night, March 25th. &#160;We have been there many times before. &#160;The below reviewer, Eden, has already written about what happened Sunday night, but I will reiterate. &#160;It was my son, six years old, who was grabbed by the neck and shaken by a man dining there with his wife. &#160;We did not see it happen, but Eden, reviewer below, got involved and pulled the man's hands off our son, for which we thank him wholeheartedly.Again, we did not see it, but we hear his offense was running past the table one too many times with his friend. &#160;If you've ever been to Madrona Ale, you know this is pretty par-for-the-course. &#160;It's normal for kids to run back and forth to each others' tables, and parents have always appreciated the casualness with which it's been handled in the past. &#160;The bartender came over to speak to Eden and, in effect, "blamed the victim." &#160;I don't care if my son was running past a table -- nothing he could have done would have warranted being grabbed by the neck and shaken by a stranger. The bartender never came to speak to us -- no one came to speak to us except Eden, who came over to make sure our son was OK. &#160;(There will be letters, oh there will be letters about that...) &#160;We are encouraging all friends to leave Madrona Ale in the dust, something our friends are all-too-willing to do given what happened Sunday night. What a disappointment, Madrona Ale. &#160; Excused assault of a six-year old? &#160;WE'RE NEVER GOING BACK. &#160;That's an understatement.-MindyP.S. Seriously... if kids annoy you, don't go there. &#160;Obvious, I should think, given the place is usually swarming with them. Not sure why it took me three times to believe this place sucks as bad as it does. &#160;We have gotten take out fish and chips and the fish was nearly raw and we ordered it again tonight and said we preferred the fish to have a crispy outside (rather than their usual soggy) and this time we got burnt to a crisp fish that barely resembles food. For a local ale house in a city that knows how to do alehouses w/great food, this place is inexcusably lame. &#160;The beer is quaffable-easy one-but the food is mediocre and overpriced, the service is consistently off-the-mark and the ambiance is cold, metallic, and loud, which makes the fireplace seem like a patronizing attempt to "make up" for the shortcomings. &#160;Tonight I had a blackened salmon sandwich ($15) which was small, burnt, and dry as sand. &#160;It made me long for the blackened salmon sand at the Columbia City Alehouse (only $13), which is always moist, spicy, and huge. &#160;What is it with this place? &#160;It seems designed to annoy as many locals as possible until it closes for lack of business, which makes its "kid friendly" come-on seem a particularly crass form of exploitation. &#160;Where else can young parents get a decent brew? &#160;Jeez, at least the place could give them speedy, attentive service and food you'd want to come back to.
I've been at a new location (2 blocks from my old location) for the past couple months, and it's given me the opportunity to try some new places. The rotunda / food court at Century Square is geared mostly to those who work in the 30-story office tower above it. It's not a shopping mall food court a la Westlake Center.I did discover a diamond in the rough here - Taste of Asia.A previous reviewer described Taste of Asia as an asian buffet. And while the food is served buffet-style, the type of "asian buffet" &#160;that reviewer seemed to be expecting was of the all-you-can-eat variety. Taste of Asia is pay-by-the-pound. It's moreso a self-serve asian deli.Ok... now to the food. I find it to be decent and filling. I get the same thing every time I go there, because I've found what I like. I grab one of those 3-segment to-go boxes. First small segment - beef bulgogi, which is awesome. Tender, flavorful...seems to have been marinated for a long time. &#160;The main compartment belongs to vegetable fried rice and vegetable chow mein. I'm a starch addict, and their versions of both are fresh and tasty. The second small segment - 3-4 potstickers, depending on how the supply is looking, and how many people are in line behind me (I feel guilty sometimes). The potstickers are usually done perfectly. Crispy on the flat bottom, with the rest of the wrapper moist and chewy. The filling is tasty.Next - they weigh in. I think they charge 6-something a pound. I usually wind up at about $8.I can't speak to the other offerings on the steam table - I will never eat buffet sushi. Sounds like a food-handling nightmare. I know what I like, and Taste of Asia fits the bill just fine
The VI's reputation rests on the fact that it's considered to be a historic and classic-Seattle bar/restaurant and that movies have been filmed here. This, unfortunately doesn't translate into delicious food or a particularly wonderful experience, and I've got about 6-10 visits to back me up. I don't know why I come back time and again, given that I really truly don't like it. I used to be offended by their definition of happy hour, but that was years ago and I assume they've gotten hip to the rest of the city and actually created discounts, rather than $1 off a beer or glass of wine. I've always been disappointed by their food. Most recently, it was a completely flavorless lamb shank that had to be doused in salt to be edible. My guest ordered salmon that was served with lentils, which had obviously received my lamb's share of salt because they were virtually inedible. My other guest's lamb order somehow turned into chicken along the way, which was too sweet. Our server was kind enough to comp her meal, but my guest couldn't find anything else on the menu that she was willing to order (especially since my lamb was so disappointing). If you're interested in sticking with the same price point, I think you could easily have a better experience elsewhere in the neighborhood (think Steelhead, Ettas, or Lecosho). Nice beer selection and the food is tasty- two visits so far and I have not been disappointed yet. I loved the drinks and the appetizers that we ordered when we here visiting downtown and Pike Place. I had brie cheese with nuts and apples. A very interesting combination. I don't know if that is because I have not had much west coast food or if this place is good at making unique dishes. Probably a bit of both. I am definitely going back next time I am in Seattle. The atmosphere is pleasant and very casual; service is same. &#160;The food was okay. &#160;The fresh bread was awesome, and the caesar salad appeared to be made from scratch with fresh ingredients but l found it and the cream of chicken soup to be under-seasoned. &#160;Certainly I tasted no anchovies in the salad dressing and none came on the salad, which made me sad.Maybe I am just a salt junkie. I just had lunch for the first time at the Virginia Inn, being a new Belltown resident.The ambiance inside is nice - typical tavern/brewery style decor with large wooden booths and not a lot of frou-frou decoration. The waitresses are nice and seem fairly attentive.I ate the Turkey/Bacon Club for $11:Smoked turkey breast and all natural applewood smoked bacon with organic arugula, apple butter and fontina cheese on Macrina's sourdough. Comes with hand-cut house chips.My lunch mate had the Chicken and Andouille Sausage Gumbo for $11:Peppers, onions and celery in a rich chicken broth, thickened with okra and filo powder served on brown basmati rice.We also had 2 cups of coffee.My thoughts:The coffee was good and in a big cup. &#160;Refills were free, which was appreciated. &#160;However, I feel the meals themselves were overpriced. &#160;While I did think my sandwich was tasty and I enjoyed the fresh bakery bread of the sandwich, as well as the apple butter, I didn't care too much for the house-made chips - they seemed a little too browned for me (over fried). My friend's Gumbo was to be honest, a little bland in the flavor of the sauce. It did have a pepper kick to it that came as an aftertaste, but the sauce itself didn't have a ton of flavor. This place is good and has lots of natural light, and is a good option if you're looking for a quiet bite while strolling around downtown, but it's not the best bistro in Seattle... I've been at the Virginia inn twice now and both times have been given stomach troubles the following day. I suspect it might be dirty pipes or glasses as I've had beer on draft on both occassions. This is one of my new favorite bars/restaurants. &#160;I don't mean to give a back handed compliment, but nothing here is truly great, ok I just did.butUnlike every other place I frequent, everything here is good. &#160;There is not a single thing, from the well bourbon to the bathroom that is sub par. &#160;All of the food is pretty good, all of the servers, fairly nice, not over bearing, the prices are low, the happy hour is even better. &#160;The bar is made of wood, and that still mean a lot to me. &#160;Though the outdoor patio has several tables, there are 2 that have a view better than the space needle.Even the best places in Seattle have huge flaws. &#160;There is something about this casual low key place where everything is c+ to a- that makes it one of the best places in town.Also, the people watching on the patio is hard to beat. We enjoyed a roasted red pepper bisque with crusty bread and the fish &amp; chips, and also split a pint. &#160;Service was friendly, in a relaxed tavern atmosphere. &#160;Nice reprieve after a few hours in bustling market.Lunch for $33 inlcudes tax and tip The ambiance is nice, the service is good, and I would have given it a much better review if it wasn't for the bland food. I went there for lunch and had their grilled duck sausage, and the French Dip au jus. To start with, the duck sausage had no flavor, except for over cooked meat, and if it wasn't for the compote, which was nice, it would have been a complete loss. The endive salad that came along with it was just chopped endive as far as I could tell, and nothing special what so ever.The only thing good about the French dip was the bread, which was tasty, but everything else was bland. Even while dipping it in their au jus the sandwich tasted... dry. The bread was tasty and nicely spongy, and really soaked up the au jus very nicely, but the au jus itself was mediocre. This au jus seemed to be house made, but I've tasted packaged au jus that tasted far better.Because of some of the other good reviews I've seen for the Virginia Inn, and it's atmosphere and service, I think I'd go back and give it another try, I'll just stay far far away from the duck sausage and French dip. I'm hoping I just chose the worst menu items, and that these aren't the norm as far as their food is concerned. Went here with a group after having sworn it off for a year because of an unfortunate incident when a mouse ran under my table, then back again. &#160;At that point, I thought it was a fluke and discretely told the bartender. &#160;I was given an excuse, no apology, and paid my bill in full. &#160;Only a few minutes after relaying this story to a few of my friends, we saw ANOTHER mouse, running around among the tables! &#160;Again, we were given excuses and no concessions on our bill...they even added gratuity because we were a large group.I asked to speak with a manager, and was invited to make a call the next day.Once is a fluke. &#160;Twice is a rodent problem. &#160;Gross. I was excited to finally check this place out on a cold, wet Friday night. My friend and I were sitting up at the bar, ready for some drinks and food. The bartender was friendly but not very quick. It's hard to be understanding of slow service when you're sitting at the bar top. I ordered an order of Vietnamese mussels and an order of fries. The food took 10 minutes too long to arrive and when it did both dishes were cold. I can understand one dish being cold, but both of them? I was given two new dishes about 10 minutes later. Both were hot and tasty. However, I was shocked that no one offered apologies, discounts or explanations. I ended up having to pay $30 for the hour and half ordeal. I'm not in a rush to go back. I had never thought to actually eat here before as I just assumed it was like any other Belltown diner, but extremely tired and hungry, my Friend and I ended up here for lunch.And I was pretty impressed; European style cafe interior with a great open air feel to it. Service wasn't amazing, but adequate. I had the Turkey Bacon sandwich; Smoked turkey breast and all natural applewood smoked bacon with organic arugula, apple butter and fontina cheese on Macrina's sourdough. &#160;Now thats a mouthful! What I liked best (well, besides the bacon, but that doesn't count) was the amazing apple butter with fontina cheese (Beechers!) . But it was huge, and alas, I could only eat half to go with my Maritime.Wasn't a huge fan of the house made potato chips; was expecting British chips - fries!....I tried a bite of my Friends Jambon...which was pretty good as well - smaller than my mondo sandwich, which was more manageable.I actually would really like to try out dinner - looks like they have a lot of great things going on there...
I've had Pho at a few places on the East Coast. There is something to be said for authentic Pho and consistency. This was just as good as back home. The service was very good and the (husband wife?) couple are very cute working this location.I'm not a fan of having the basil or honking piles of bean sprouts in my Pho but these were good I had to add them in since they were so fresh. I'm mostl all about the noodles! They were delish! The only improvement I could suggest would be to not overcook the meat I don't have much to add here. Had the beef pho, sat at the counter and piled on my little plate of accessories (and some chili sauce) and it was good!
This gives White Center a major lifestyle upgrade. &#160; Comfortable and not full of riffraff . &#160;Really cool looking bathrooms too. &#160;They also make one hell of a sidecar! This is a cool spot to swing by late after work at night. White Center isn't exactly as lively as other more hoppin' Seattle nite spots but if you catch yourself walkin' along the sidewalks here on 16th Ave SW, go here and dig the vibe. It's sufficiently lively (not rowdy), the space is uniquely modern, perfectly lit and has awesome, imposing portrait artwork along the side wall opposite the bar.Got me some beer and the chickpea fries. Everything sounded great and some things they have I've not seen before and wanted to try (hint: cilantro lime tofu dish). I'm gonna have to return for those. Anyway, the CPF's were great! They had similar texture as thick, skin fries like Hudson's but minus the sense of bloatedness and grease/wet mess. Just right and lightly dense.Allison was a friendly &amp; fun/ny bartender. I'd overheard chat with (I'm guessing) one of her regulars:"Enjoy the bl0wj0bs!" --(I would've spit my beer out if I was drinking, atm, that was so hilarious!).I also got the croquettes to-go. Looked inside the box to check 'em out, paid, finished my beer and left... Daren gets home and whaddaya know, Daren forgets his food. I called back and said she can give 'em away. "Oh, don't worry about it, honey," she said. I love that Company opened in WC. They have a laid back, trendy atmosphere with the rotating art and full bar. It's the kind of place you take people when you want to show that "you know a cool spot they haven't been to yet."Their menu is more than you'd expect and a crowd favorite is their tots' We experimented with a chickpea fry on our last visit and they get a full start for that kind of out of the box creation. It's really something I've never had before. Oh and the beet salad mmmmmm. Holy crow, there's an amazing restaurant in White Center. &#160;Get there now! &#160;We stopped by Company after doing a little Adult Skate at the Roller Rink around the corner. &#160;We got tickets at the Rink that allowed us happy hour pricing on our drinks after happy hour was over.Great beer selection, the food sounds amazing. &#160;We had some tots and they were crispy, salty goodness. &#160;Can't wait to go back and try everything else! &#160;Nice music selections playing and lovely decor. &#160;Like the vibe here! We tried out the Company after struggling to find their location - not clearly marked. &#160;Good first impression - nice decor and a good vibe. &#160;Friendly staff, but pretty slow to respond after we arrived (it wasn't that busy). &#160;There was a good micro selection, including Georgetown brews. &#160;Our friend had martinis that one described as the "worst ever." &#160;There was a good selection of fried goodies, but not really much else to eat - not a place for a meal, plus the menu was only on the wall. &#160;We want this new White Center business to succeed - they really need more place like this - but they weren't hitting on all cylinders for me. &#160; We'll given them another try though.P.S. &#160;The Bacon wrapped figs were fabulous! Fantastic live music and dry ice at White Center's city hall. Company is charming and welcoming! A co-worker and I stopped in after working late one evening, and the place was crowded, but pleasantly so. The bartender was cheerful and helpful. We had a few cocktails and appetizers which were much better than anticipated! The sopas were lightly crisp on the outside and oh so flavorful. We will definitely be back!
This place is small, parking is always cramped, well more on the weekends. I went here on the recommendations of my co-workers. I can see why they go here. The store mostly carries Filipino itemsI. I didn't even know the owners were Vietnamese until i heard them speaking. If you ever get to talk to the owner he'll tell you how he came about the Flilipino culture. Cool story indeed. My hubby and I come here to buy his Filipino pantry items for us and sometimes the in-laws. He is able to get his bagoong, longanisa and other items. I buy my banh mi sandwiches, nuoc mam. It works out. The staff are friendly and are able to speak decent Tagalog. I find that awesome! Cons: parking, crowdsPros: prices, staff, and take out food
I have been here a few times now and this place is amazing. They make good drinks and have an awesome selection of beer. My bartender, Alena, created me my very own drink that she now calls The Lion Tamer. I highly reccomend you order one of these! The other bartender I have had service from is Darina and she is a bad ass bartender and can definitely handle her rushes. Customer service had always been an A+!The food is also fantastic. I have had the steak sandwich and the caesar salad which were both so good. the steak sandwich had so many flavors that worked so well together and the croutons on the caesar salad were so good that they asked me if I wanted some more haha! I dont eat seafood but my friend had their famous chowder and loved it so much. she just moved in to town so needless to say she will definitely be back for more!its never too loud inside, always very clean, and the staff, drinks, and food are great! definitely do yourself a favor and stop in. I want to love this place but I can only give three stars... Actually I'd rather 2.5 but alas that is not an option. Anyway, BF and I went in to get some beer and some grub and do some work.We both had our laptops out (thanks for free wireless!) and spent about 90 minutes there, had two appetizers, split a meal and four beers. Tab was over 70. Ouch. Food was just okay, especially for the high price tag. Hummus was nothing special. Soup was good but very rich. As others have noted, beers and food were served with a side of attitude. &#160;Great location, great beer selection, great ambiance. They need to either step up the food quality and service or bring down the prices. Hey, how about both? :-) Until then we'll stick with the AC. We'll try MH again in a couple months to see if things have changed... Boyfriend and I eagerly awaited Mutiny Hall to open. A new neighborhood pub! We went within its first couple weeks, so I'm cutting some slack here. If I could, I'd give it 2.5 stars. The good: The Mac and Cheese. Sooo good. The beer selection, as others have mentioned, is extensive. The meh: &#160;Boyfriend ordered the salmon. The fish was dry, and the overall serving size was paltry. We ordered fries (which were delicious) to compensate. The service was a little inattentive, and the hostess had an aloof/annoyed attitude that is more fitting of a bartender in Capitol Hill. Honestly, what was most disappointing was the TVs. There are three giant TVs in a relatively small space. I was disappointed in the sports bar ambience when I expected a neighborhood pub. One &#160;TV would have sufficed, like at its sister restaurant Hudson. Even Boyfriend was put off by the TVs. We'll probably give it another try, but it's not likely to be our first choice. Yay for a new neighborhood restaurant! We watched it transform from an empty out-of-business Mexican place to a classy pub, and I've been in twice now.The first time was just for a beer. I had a pumpkin brew, which was delicious as most are. It came in a smaller glass -- one of those fancy goblets -- and was still the same price as a regular pint. Oh well! Sometimes those super-flavorful beers are a bit too much anyway. Then we went again on Friday night for dinner. I swear their prices have dropped since they first opened. When we looked at the menu posted in the window, I think the original prices were pretty high; the cheapest thing was a $14 burger. But now the same menu was at least $2 less per item. I did have the cheeseburger, which was juicy and cooked to order. Fries were excellent as well. It's still on the spendy side; for two burgers and 4 beers, the total was $50. So we might not be back a ton to eat, but I'm definitely willing to sample their happy hour next! We found ourselves at Mutiny Hall watching the election returns - happy to find a place we could get a solid dinner and some good beer, plus take advantage of the cable TV! &#160;The beer selection is awesome here. They have rotating taps, 20 or so options at any given time. Dinner was good, too! Highly recommend the white bean hummus (YUM) and the house salad (nice and fresh, with blue cheese). My cheeseburger was pretty impressive, a big full-flavored, juicy patty with Tillamook cheddar cheese. &#160;It earned its $12 price tag, though just barely - that's steep for a burger in my book. The fries were good, though I recommend adding sweet potato fries for $1 more. My boyfriend was thrilled to find meatloaf as the special of the evening, served as little sliders on mini buns - he was a very happy camper. All in all, this is a very welcome addition to the Roosevelt/Ravenna neighborhood. I'm impressed with the beer choices and the food holds its own, making it a worthy option for dinner rather than just drinks... that being said, it's in the middle price range at $10-$15 for entrees. Great, friendly service, though, and lots of TV's for sports (or elections!). They post their beer menu and daily specials on their facebook page. We'll keep tabs on this place! I recently tried out Mutiny Hall on a Sunday night - figured it would be a great pub food night. &#160;I walked in and seated myself at a centrally located table. &#160;About 20 minutes (I'm not kidding) later I was approached by a server with a menu - there were three service employees in the place serving no more than 20 people. &#160;I took a look at their beer list - lengthy but not as diverse as I would expect. &#160;Half of list (not kidding) were IPAs and there were no unfiltered beers on the list. &#160;I ordered an amber that resembled and tasted more like a brown ale - OK but not really what I expected. I ordered the much ballyhooed burger - with bacon, of course! &#160;It was good - but not rave worthy. &#160;I would take 50 North's burger over this one, personally, and they have plenty of nice beers to choose from. &#160;Particularly for $14.Service did not improve throughout the hour+ that I was there. &#160;I exited with a $23 tab for a good burger and an OK beer. &#160;I don't get what the fuss is about. &#160;The neighborhood already has Pies and Pints and the Third Street Pub, both of which have interesting menus (at more accessible prices) and pleasant beer selections (with good pub atmosphere and good service). &#160;I think that this place needs some supervision and a revamp in order to stick around long term. Easily one of my favorite places to relax, grab a beer (from at least 10 on tap!!! local and delicious) and if you arrive before 10, grab a bite to eat. The menu boasts a good variety without being overwhelming boasting local distributors (like Painted Hills steak!!) The mussels are delicious with their cream broth, the wings (which were a Husky game special) were smoky and the burger meaty, juicy and perfectly seasoned. The service here is fantastic, its always been gracious, impeccable and friendly. The snazzy wood interior is new and still has that mmmm new wood smell. And if you find that your date begins to bore you, sit down, relax, order a couple more beers (or some cocktails from their bar) and enjoy the game from 4 different flat screen TVs. This was opening night. It was busy. They were unprepared. Service was sluggish. Not enough draught lists had been printed. The list on the window had said Pliny the Elder would be on tap, but the truck was late and so it wasn't yet available. Neither was half of the menu.Good. We've gotten the bad out of the way.The fact remains that the draught list was exceptional. This is a beer place. I would give this another chance. Who am I kidding? I will give this another chance. And once they have mastered food and service, I'm sure this will be worth four or five stars to me. I will be back. Good addition to the neighborhood (still sad Jaliscos is gone, but happy something delicious finally moved in!)Beer selection was excellent. Lots on tap. The bar looked well stocked. Food options were pretty good. The burger was top notch- which is great for someone on the hunt for the city's best burger. The pork chop and grits seemed tasty if that was your thing (it's not mine but my husband finished his AND my plate so I'm guessing it passes)The space is great. Totally transformed. Dark finishes with lots of light from outside. Excited this place is here. Looking forward to trying more stuff. Welcome to the neighborhood MH! This is my favorite new place to drink alcohol, and consume food as well for that matter. Their tap list boasts an impressive variety of about 20 quality beers that, as far as I understand, rotate continually to reflect what's in season, what's tasty and what's interesting. I have now been back for food three times and each has proved really quite tasty. I originally went for the veggie burger, which was pretty tasty. The decision to add bacon was a good one. Very good bacon with a hearty, thick crunch. I then went back for a hamburger, which was a perfectly cooked medium-rare and melted completely in my mouth. Paired with some of the best brews the West Coast has to offer, the food has been nothing short of delicious and I look forward to many more a Sounders game spent in this comfy winner of a public house.(They also have a soon-to-be-world-famous clam chowder!) Good beer selection although some things on the board are usually sold out. &#160;It gets a little noisy here sometimes. &#160;The food is pretty good although last time I was here the selection was limited. &#160;As far as bars in the area go I would this would be my second choice - it is nice to have options. Great beers on tap! Probably a 5 star place. &#160; Will update when I've gone back more than 2 more times. Great food, atmosphere and service. &#160;Yep, I waited until they were open a couple weeks. &#160;I love their house salad. &#160;My friend loved the burger with bacon and the fries were hot and delicious. &#160;I ordered the mussels and was surprised to find myself savoring every one. &#160;I love clams and mussels, and these mussels were outstanding. &#160;What I liked in particular was our waitress. &#160;I believe her name was Sarah. &#160;She recommended a Belgian ale I had never tried before and hit the bingo. &#160;I am not a a big football fan, but if you are-- there are three screens. &#160;I was promised soccer and baseball would also be on. &#160;What a pleasant surprise, and nice change from the Azteca wannabes that have been in this spot. &#160;As one who got cranky at the opening of Hudson's -- I am glad I waited a few weekends before going. &#160;I hope the folks who went opening night and gave bad reviews unwind their knickers and try again. You know that yoga class you are taking that ends with the teacher encouraging compassion and love to everyone in the room? &#160;It extends down the block to Mutiny... check the chalkboard out for one of over 20 ales and some fine service. Beer should be served with a smile. Beer is good. It makes life better. It is both a comfort for a sad day or a celebration of a great one. Do not serve me attitude with my beer.This stated and out of the way I can continue my review. I live in the hood and we walked from our home to check out the new place with some friends and family that had stopped by to wish my husband a happy birthday. We are all in our forties and there were seven of us. The beer list was on a chalkboard in a pale white chalk and it is embarrassing to admit almost all of us could not read the selection from our table. We asked our annoyed and brusque waitress if she could read the list for us which she initially declined because "it is written on the chalkboard already and it's too long to read" &#160;We begged help because of our poor eyesight and she quickly read the list which was not that many after all and served it with an extra side of attitude. We ordered three appetizers and another round of beers. The food was marginal, the beer was delicious, our side of fries was exceptional. Food seemed pricey for quantity served. We would love this place to succeed and will try again. Especially since Pies and Pints gets so busy their always pleasant staff sometimes can't get beer out quickly enough. We eventually retired to Teddy's and had pitchers of cold beer with the perfect atmosphere and didn't quite make it to Atlantic Street Crossing before walking home. There are great choices in our hood and Mutiny had better step it up to make a lasting home for itself. As an added note the waitress with all the tattoos who sat us was awesome and we enviously watched her happy tables being served with a smile. Love the daytime waitress. Food and Beer Lists, all Quality.. Oh, Mutiny Hall, I want to love you, but I can only give you three stars. &#160;Our server, Nikki, was fantastic. &#160;Personable without being invasive, gave us great beer suggestions, and the service was great.We were there at 4:00 PM on Friday, and there was no happy hour.....seriously? &#160;No happy hour prices on food? &#160;I get it if you don't want to discount the quality beers, but cut me a deal on the food.The location and space is really great, and the ambiance of the interior is fine.I'd definitely go there again, though maybe for lunch or dinner instead of happy hour. &#160;Totally recommend this place! This restaurant fits a great niche for something a little more mature and relaxed but high quality in the grad student/UW employee/professional neighborhood of Ravenna/Roosevelt which has been much-needed. The space is welcoming and unpretentious and the burger that I had was genuinely exceptional. My friend had the chicken and loved it. I don't know what happened there, but I'm still thinking about the burger days later. The food was great! The drinks were good, there was a wide selection of beer and the people in the tables around me were all really happy with their food too. There was one glaring problem though- our server was awful. Judging from some of the other reviews, it may be the same employee. Holy geez. I order a standard drink of liquor mixed with soda to which she barked "What!? I don't understand what it is you want." Whoa. She then proceeded to ignore our table (I actually had to get up and ask someone else for water) for 20 minutes. We rolled with it and eventually got our food, but she was so rude that when we needed napkins - not only was she not available (looking at us and walking away when we tried to flag her down) but we actually ate most of our dinner with no napkins. It certainly would have benefited her to keep bringing us drinks - but when I slid my glass to the edge of the table so that she'd notice when it was empty, she looked at it - then looked at me like 'yeah, get it your f-in self' and kept moving. Uh, thanks. To top it off, it wasn't that busy. We're pretty easy going, but you absolutely can't have staff that treat the customers like that. In fairness, the backup server who was assisting other tables was sweet, bouncy, polite and accomodating and seeemd to be having a great time with her tables. She's the one saving the stars on this review. Overall recommendation - definitely a good place to meet a few friends, it's nice, it's reasonable the crowd is chill and the the food is great. A good weeknight joint. Another awesome joint by Seth Howard (Collins Pub, Hudson, Last Drop).It's more like Collins Pub, with the same great beer selection you'd expect. &#160;And the same GREAT burger. Went here for beers and dinner last night with a bunch of friends. Food was delicious, beer selection was fantastic. Glad to have it in the neighborhood! Ate here on first and second day of business. First day had a limited menu and second night had a few restrictions, but everything we had was delicious - especially the burger! Great beer selection. So glad to have a new addition to the neighborhood.
I love this place because its a couple blocks from home, totally comfortable, and has a good range. &#160;and i like looking at the walls and fantasizing about going to greece. &#160;it's the kind of place where any dish is way too much for one person and if you ask them to split something, they will bring two portions that are like 3/4 of what the regular plate would be... That said, I wouldn't travel for it, because I can't stand waiting for breakfast and it's insanely crowded on weekends... Though i do go to Voula's which is sort of far, and closely related. &#160; My favorite is to get there at 7 on a weekday morning and eat with my guy before we go to work. &#160;it's like a different world or a different side of the city, no matter where you do that.... I really don't understand how Pete's gets such good reviews. &#160;I went there a few times when my husband and I first moved into the area (it's right up the street), but I decided that I can make the same stuff at home for way cheaper and healthier. &#160;I just think there's such a lack of good breakfast places, Pete's is over-rated. &#160;I prefer El Camino in Fremont - their breakfasts are delicious and the ambience is a lot better. Petes is cool, small and has a cozy family like feel. However the food was not good enough to have me come back. Eggs and potatos were not seasoned properly and my linguisa sausages were luke warm at best. The food is a good value and a huge pottions but the flavors really disappointed me. If you go, eat pancakes, they do those well, but skip the french toast, dont get your hopes up and show up early.Oh, the sevice was kind and friendly. I am a big fan of the nest, however in recent years I have become more and more disappointed. &#160;I first started coming here back in my college days. &#160;I would hit the nest saturday or sunday mornings to cure the good ole hangovers.The place is usually packed and unless you are early plan on waiting for a table. &#160;When I first started coming here I was all about their eggs benedict. &#160;However in recent times the quality has seriously gone down. &#160;The english muffin is never toasted any more (and if you have ever eaten one before toasting you know its no good) not to mention the hollandaise sauce isnt as creamy and delicious as it once was.After my disappointment with the eggs benedict I had to switch my meal to the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs. This is the staple my buddies had been living off of for years. &#160;Huge portions make it nearly impossible to finish but if you have a big enough appetite you will be soaking up any left over gravy with the fresh biscuits served alongside.
We'd heard great things about Mistral Kitchen and we weren't disappointed. My husband and I went for Valentine's Day which can be challenging for many restaurants. Mistral truly delivered on every level. From the outstanding food, pacing of the courses, the warm knowledgable waitstaff, charming and informed wine steward, to the beautiful room (the Jewel Box) we enjoyed every moment of our evening. I appreciated the attention to all the details large and small. &#160;We'll be back...and bring our foodie friends! &#160;This is a restaurant that gets it right. Love the food and the ambiance. &#160;Have been here several times for dinner (great experience sitting at the bar for dinner) as well as happy hour. &#160;The wait staff is extremely attentive and the food was awesome (the food was slightly modified to be more vegetarian/pescaterian friendly). &#160;It's great for foodies and a great place to take out of town visitors. how often do you get the chance to order your drink by rolling the dice? &#160;i'm not talking watered-down vegas cocktails, but rather well thought-out concoctions crafted to enhance your evening, not drown out the sorrow of a resulting second mortgage. &#160;mistral kitchen has crafted such an experience: the 4 d 6. &#160;with a tagline of "no saving throws, all booze, all chance, always stirred, stiff and served up", the choice was clear. &#160;after some satisfying selections resulting from the throws of our bartender (gin and citrus come to mind), the balance of power soon shifted and we gained control our own fate. &#160;a velvet bag revealed four large wooden blocks, each emblazoned with pyrography depicting various base spirits and flavour profiles. maybe it was the weight of the dice, the clanging sound they made as they landed onto the glass table, or the feeling of contributing to the creative process, but luck was a lady that night. &#160;as the bartender did the shake, i was getting baked...but the best part was that i helped. After checking out the beautiful website and reading some reviews we chose Mistral Kitchen for our pre-Christmas out to dinner restaurant. We got dressed up and were prepared for a beautiful dining out experience. This is a big restaurant and I"m still not really sure how it works but we were seated at a table for two in the large bar area. I was facing the bar which I found to be tacky and not at all in sync with the vibe or mood of the restaurant. There was a big pot of &#160;poinsettia's that looked like they should have been in the Spaghetti Factory. So much for elegance and chic. We did not enjoy this ambience at all. The menu is on the small side - we both had salads to start which might not sound that interesting and you're right, they weren't! My husband had the lamb which was delicious and in a really good sauce. I had the Branzino which was totally unmemorable. I basically &#160;left the restaurant hungry and depressed that you can spend that kind of money and have such a mediocre experience. &#160;Service was fine but the overall experience was really disappointing. Mistral Kitchen lacked soul and depth - don't believe the hype. Came back for happy hour and the highlight was the Thai popcorn. &#160;Ouch. &#160;We actually ordered off the dinner menu because the HH menu sucked. &#160;Stick with dinner. We celebrated New Years Eve 2011 in the Jewel Box at Mistral and it was everything we hoped for. They served an 8 course dinner with wine pairings. Unlike similar dinners we've had at other restaurants, the portions were more than adequate. The service was fantastic! We started the evening with a cocktail and the first course came out just as we finished our drinks. Each course was timed and prepared perfectly. Alex was our sommelier and took us on an exquisite tour around the world with his expert selection of pairings. He shared details of the growing regions and the producers. The overall experience was excellent and but that came with a high price tag, comparably higher than other new year's options such as Crush, Il Bistro and Le Gourmand but I was satisfied that we got what we expected out of the experience. Favorite dish was the foie gras. Came to Mistral after much debate looking for a chef's table for a birthday dinner. &#160;I was given a referral from another restaurant and told Mistral had a version of a chef's table (note: if you are looking - The Rainier Club has one...a REAL one and you don't have to be a member). &#160;I called in advance and was told it was $250 per person but that included a tasting of wine with each course. &#160;I explained that we don't drink so would that change the pricing at all? &#160;Nope! &#160;Ok, I was fooled once at the Herb Farm (told their mocktails were "even better than the wine" ummmm not. even. close.) so I made the reservation but had it in my head that I would continue to shop around. &#160;Mistral has no dress code - I was told "if YOU think you look good then Mistral does too". Cute but unfortunately this become the selling point for my date who lives in jeans, Ts, and tennis shoes ALL THE TIME. &#160;Ugh! &#160;Why did I admit that to him??!!! &#160;So note - if you have someone in your life that doesn't enjoy dressing up this could be your spot.The day before dinner I received a confirmation call and I explained I really was having a hard time with the 8 course $90 meal being $250 because of the alcohol (plus tax, plus tip) and the ability to sit at the "chef's table" which is not actually in the kitchen or next to the expo line but about 10 feet away from it. &#160;The person I spoke to said we could sit in the "jewel box" which was just as nice and had the same menu. &#160;I do appreciate her honesty. &#160;I definitely would have been disappointed after seeing the chef's table but I was surprised that mocktails still cost the same at Mistral as cocktails. &#160;I got our bill and had $75 in mocktail charges. &#160;THIS IS JUICE! &#160;I understand there is a markup on everything at a restaurant but if I coke is $2-3 and a cocktail is $8-10 I just don't understand how a mocktail can also be $8? &#160;The service was five star and the food was a solid 3.5 but the charges here are pretty crazy. &#160;I would recommend the jewel box for a special occasion - the $90 price was fine but a $315 total bill just felt unfair/unjustified and means I would probably not return. 2.75 stars: frou frou fails to fulfill.Has potential to be more but currently seems like a valiant but unsuccessful, over-priced effort at the farm-to-table small plates trend, done beautifully elsewhere.Offerings are largely tasting portions, plated aesthetically but more form than substance - from what I recall: Seared foie gras was delectable, sole noteworthy selectionServer oversold the chicken (recommended over the duck breast) - tender but flavor nothing extraordinary. Arugula was literally a plate of arugula, minimally dressed.Bland ambiance, oddly reminiscent of a hotel resto-lounge. Moscow Mule (vodka-based Dark/Stormy) made with strong ginger beer, fulfilling. Craft cocktails w/heavy bourbon representation worth trying but otherwise too out of the way to consider returning Friendly staff and really good (and not oversized) food. &#160;A little noisy though but not unpleasant. there seems to be a string of us that come here for bday celebrations and i'm at the back of the line, i guess. &#160; lotta people got busy in march, i guess.anyways, one of my friends took me here for dinner to whoop it up a bit. &#160;we made it early enough to catch the end of hh and managed to catch a beverage and some apps. &#160;we started with the brittle, clams and octo seviche. &#160;i will rave about the octo...the plate coming out looking like a dish of slice radishes. &#160;bright, tender and well seasoned. &#160;those were gobbled. &#160;the clams were nestled in a great broth, but the chorizo chunks inside were a bit more dense and chewy than i thought worked with the dish.the entrees we picked were fabulous. &#160;a lush, juicy chop and our favorite, short ribs with lentils, were really outstanding. &#160; the ribs and lentils were a great pairing (i wish there were more lentils!) and i continue to think about the chop. &#160;dessert was a shared gingerbread baton, with a lemony marscapone. &#160;some light and bright to end the evening. &#160;staff was friendly and knowledgeable. &#160;only knockdown is due to the seating area. &#160;even though we were deep inside the restaurant facing the window, there was a brutally cold draft that blasted through from time to time. &#160;otherwise, the open area kept us private from the rest of the people and yet didn't create a din that would make it difficult to hear at your table.impressed! Went here for a work lunch a few months ago. &#160;I liked the space and location, but that is about all I liked about Mistral Kitchen. &#160;The color palette was pretty depressing - all grays and industrial looking. The space itself is cool and I really think they could have done something else more creative with it. &#160;But some people like that look...I guess I am just not one of them.The menu seemed very heavy for lunch - duck, pork chops, and other similar items. &#160;There were a few lighter choices, but not many and nothing I was interested in trying. &#160;I ended up going with the pork chop with squash and cauliflower, but only because I wasn't excited about any of the other items.Our food took quite a while to arrive, which really surprised me considered there were only two other full tables in the entire restaurant. &#160;The pork chop was...disappointing. &#160;The squash ended up being some sort of sauce drizzled on the plate. &#160;The pork chop was supposed to come "smoked," but to me tasted like it was pumped full of liquid smoke. &#160;The first bite intrigued me, but as I continued to eat, I became more and more unhappy with the flavor. &#160;I wasn't able to finish my plate because it was just too strong and too much.The peach ice cream we had after the meal was very good. &#160;Probably the highlight of the meal.While reading a few of the negative reviews of Mistral Kitchen, I see that the owner has impolitely responded on a couple of occasions. &#160;I understand that sometimes certain parties of people might not be polite, but I think it is funny that he accuses others of being rude when he is being beyond rude and condescending himself. &#160;Being disrespectful toward customers isn't exactly going to bring them back in the door.And just like that, it's doubtful I'd ever give this place another chance. Andrew makes the best drinks in town hands down. If the smoke gun is working, order the Courting Rachel. Delicious. Poor service (waiter gave the bare minimum of info, basics weren't offered, drinks showed up well after our appetizers without explanation, general attitude), and only okay food, especially for the price and in comparison to other Seattle restaurants. Won't waste my time here again. Went here for lunch today... and I had to get the pork belly sliders. The pork belly was well cooked and tasty, however the bread was too salty. I ended up drinking a lot of water... if the chef was on TC he would have gone home for that dish.. I might give it another shot &#160;for dinner but then thats it.. I'm arguably a vegetarian since mid-2010, but really, I think I'm a flexitarian?? &#160;Let's put it this way, I think you cannot consider yourself a foodie if you have several dietary restrictions..and so, I am more lenient to eating meat now than before..though, from the dinner we had at Mistral's last night, I realized that I canNOT make myself eat a slice of still pink mammal especially with a use of a scalpel..I had at least 6 little slices of the blue lamb chops before I called it quits (it was the fifth course), and I am already having a problem getting my food down of the eight-course dining we signed up for.here's the quickie: the oysters, hamachi, prawn and prosciutto are perfectly Northwest..fresh, minimalist, source to table approach..the foie gras, and lamb chop I had problem with. &#160;The foie gras to me was a little to gamy and organy and the lamb chop is blue. &#160;To the foie gras defense, the bf said it's buttery and good. the nuts and cheese plate is a good touch (they do this best at Noble Fir--Ballard Represent!)nothing extraordinary with the pumpkin sorbet (the "bridge" course)the dessert I do not quite fancy. Sorry. The milk chocolate and mango mousse reminded me of an Asian type of rice cake wrapped in banana leaves, steamed, which I'm pretty sure is not what they're going for. &#160;I suggest not shaping any brown colored mousse in any tubular form of some sort. &#160;It reminded me of Pierre's #2 and that's not a nice thing coz Pierre is a very cute, fluffy and white Pomeranian and any food should never be compared to your pet's excrement.Our dinner reservation was at 7, we had eight courses, and we left at 11 pm. (same day, gladly) &#160;We're pretty much on time, so there, do your math. &#160;I was throwing attitude at course 6? &#160;I don't know. I blame the girl with giant hair sitting next to us who never stopped talking..She stole my voice at some point during the night that I ran out of things to say to my bf, and I just really wanted for them to bring the rest of the courses and call it a night. &#160;But who knows, it could be that almost half an hour times in between courses..Cocktails are the shiznit! There I said it.SUMMARY: If you really want a perfect 8-10 course dining experience, go to The Herbfarm--up in Woodinville, next to Barking Frog. &#160;It is a must try. &#160;Guaranteed! Fantastic cocktails. The Russian Mule is a must have if you like sassy ginger drinks. Not a huge selection of vegetarian options, but the chef whipped me up something fresh and delicious (and not on the menu.)The chocolate financier with bourbon mousse I had for dessert was amazing. The waitress was fantastic, personable but not pushy. My mom's chicken wasn't cooked all the way through, which is the only reason I gave this place 4 stars, not 5. Pros1. Service - Our waiter was excellent. He was knowledgeable, personable, and attentive. I guess we got lucky. 2. Food - I heard no complaints. Everyone liked their dishes. We had people order steak, chicken, pork, prosciutto, oysters, and even their mixed nuts. &#160;3. Portions - They were refreshingly decent. I don't feel anyone's dishes looked skimpy. The prosciutto appetizer platter was ginormous. You won't be taking a doggy bag home, but you shouldn't feel hungry after dinner either. Cons1. Price - It was on the expensive side, at least from a poor guy's perspective. It wasn't overboard though, especially since their portions were good.2. Parking - You're on your own. 3. Menu - As an illiterate, meat and potatoes, average joe who isn't all that knowledgeable about foods, it would've been appreciated to have short, 1 sentence descriptions next to each dish. Not a huge deal thanks to the power of the interwebs on my phone. I'm just saying...For a special occasion or a night out, this place is worth checking out, especially if you drank. The best part is you won't feel totally ripped off as their portions are fine.
I think I like my Chicago Banh Mi better, but this was ridiculously cheap. Go, please. Shhhhhhh! &#160;don't tell the people who run this place that the prices they charge are obscenely cheap! &#160;seriously, food for 4, $14?!!!? &#160;and it's GOOD! &#160;on the fondness meter, this ranks right up there with gummi bears and puppies. So my husband's BIL was driving us around chinatown Seattle and I've noticed that there were quite a bit of vietnamese business around and I asked if there were any good vietnamese sandwiches around the area and he drove us to this place. &#160;He got me the bbq pork sandwich and it was delicious. &#160;Just the way I like it. &#160;A nice toasted french bread filled with bbq pork, pickled turnip and carrots with a slice of cucumber. &#160;Yum! This place rocks with everything from the famous Banh Mi to their portions of traditional Vietnamese foods that you could purchase for $2. &#160;The Canh Chua there is pure heaven along with the chicken curry. &#160;Service is good. &#160;If you come around closing time, they have discounted foods for only $1 My favourite Vietnamese Deli!Lots of choices: cheap$ 3-4, tasty lunch box (with 2-3 choices of meat and vegies among 10 of them ). &#160;Meat filled sanwiches($2.5), great French coffee($1-2), sticky rice ($1-2), spring rolls ($ 2 ), noodle rolls ($3-4), must I say more...One of the cleanest deli around Jackson street tooFast, quick and appropriate service. &#160;What can you ask more? I can't remember how many banh mi I had in college. I used to buy 5 and get the 6th one free, throw some in the fridge and nuke them in microwave the next day. Back then it was $1 for each so for $5 I was able feed myself for at least couple of days.The current owner at Saigon Deli used to be in the building near by somehow moved the new location a few years ago.. I'm kind of curious if he sold it a relative on good terms since the new store was too close to the old one hence non-compete clause might have kicked in.. who knows.Anyway, on a recent trip to Little Saigon, a friend and I stopped at Seattle Deli for couple of banh mi and iced coffee. Then just for the heck of it, we stopped by Saigon Deli to grab two more sandwiches. Both my friend and I agreed that Saigon Deli's banh mi tasted better for our palate but Seattle Deli is cleaner inside if you are picky about it. After having dessert at Unicorn Crepes, I found myself still hungry so I decided to get a Bahn Mi. &#160;What a deal for a great sandwich, $2.50 gets you a tasty pork sandwich, with cilantro, jalapeno, pickled carrots &#160;and daikon.The open food bar &#160;contained all kinds of interesting looking items that I'll save for a future visit. Well, I already can say one thing that Seattle has over Los Angeles. &#160;The proximity of banh mi delis. &#160;In LA, if I want me a good banh mi, I had to drive 45 minutes to Alhambra or an hour and 15 to Westminster. &#160;It sucked because I had cravings for them all the time.But here in lil' ol' Jet City? &#160;I'm 10 minutes away from something like 80 different banh mi shops. &#160; And I'll say this right now. &#160;I'm not going to be a snob and say "no vietnamese food is any good outside of Westminster." &#160;Because really, it's a freaking sandwich. &#160;A really good freaking sandwich. &#160;But an easy one to make, as long as you have crispy franch baguettes and the necessary goods. &#160;Now, I always get my banh mi with cold cuts, so I can't tell you if their BBQ pork is better than another's. &#160;Also, I haven't been to another deli other than this one. &#160;But why should I? &#160;The price is good, the banh mi is good, and so is their che (ok, now I'll be the snob and say che is better in Westminster). &#160; &#160;I will have to say this, too. &#160;White folk in Seattle are more tuned to the glory that is banh mi than the white folk in LA. &#160;Down there, they think pho and Nikes are the only things that Vietnamese people make. What a great find! &#160;Hubby brought home dinner tonight from this place and everything tasted fresh and delicious. &#160;$2.50 for banh mi thit nuong (grilled pork sandwich) can't be beat! &#160;The grilled pork wasn't too fatty and the flavors were spot on. &#160;I also really liked the green sponge cake dessert. &#160;It was light, spongy and not too sweet. &#160;I am sure we'll be coming here quite often. I went through a phase where I was totally addicted to the pork sandwich. I'd drive all the way across town for them. I love the staff too. Of the four Vietnamese Delis around 12th &amp; Jackson this one is my favorite. &#160;It is the most expensive of the four (which doesn't change the fact that it's silly cheap) but I think the overall quality is the best. &#160;Their pork is chunky and flavorful and their chicken is real chunks of tasty dark meat. &#160;The only thing keeping them from getting five stars is their bread, which is nothing special and can be kinda dry. &#160;The place is popular, though, and if its got a giant line or the lot is full I head to one of the other delis rather than wait it out. At $2.25 this is hard to beat!Service = Quick and easy!Ambiance = if you want to pay $2 for a sandwich this shouldn't be a questionFood = Pork sandwich, and try to soi ga. &#160;simply the best deal in town!Price = $2Crowd = Overworked asiansFavorite = best deal in town!Worst = location, ambianceFinal Say = I think the value took away from the fact the sandwich are made perfectly with a balance of flavor from the french baguette to the cilantro, and nicely seasoned pork! vietnamese sandwiches are my jam. cheap. good bread. i mean its obviously not gourment but hell, it tastes good. the language barrier can be comedic at times. but they're all nice. just don't expect them to take off your cilantro when u ask. This place might look and feel dirty but understand this is the "norm" in I.D.! &#160;You come down here and should be expecting this kind of atmosphere. LOL! &#160;Not sure about anything else because kind hard to eat something that have been touch at by countless persons or how long it been on display. &#160;However the BANH MI are the best in I.D.! &#160;Fresh and very high quality. &#160;If you're eating budget or in a hurry, you can't do better than a BBQ Pork Banh Mi! &#160;Highly recommended. Nothing new to add, just piling on the love.Only complaint? &#160;There are approximately 400,000,000 billion businesses up around Jackson that are named Saigon (something). &#160;For instance, there's a New Saigon Deli, a Saigon Deli, a New Saigon and god only knows what else, so it took me 3 trips to find the place, mostly because I'm an idiot.
I'm not saying the food is TERRIBLE, but, it lacked the heat and spices I'm used to...The oddly cold injera tasted store-bought and the gomen was absolutely flavorless. I feel like there is so much wasted potential here if this is how the food normally is but maybe I just caught them on an off day. I honestly don't understand why people are saying this is the BEST Ethiopian place in Seattle.... I left feeling disappointed. Went here with my friend for lunch today. The place is nice and definitely a converted house. I think that gives it some charm. Definitely too cold to sit outside, so we dined inside. I ordered a veggie combo to share with my friend and she ordered a Kitfo (minced spiced raw beef) she had hers cooked lightly. The staff are nice and the owner is also sweet. It also helps that my friend is Ethiopian too, makes the dining experience fun. The food didn't take that long to come out, or it could of been that we were busy catching up. The veggie combo had it's standard items.I noticed the portion is a bit smaller than other places I frequent. Not necessarily a bad thing, since I've since cut back on my portions. My friend and I were able to enjoy it. There was a bit of spice missing from some items, but it was passable. It wasn't the best I've had, but it was good. You get one piece of injera on the separate platter, along with what is put on platter itself. I thought that was enough for me, but you can always ask for more. My friend liked her Kitfo and ended up taking leftovers home, which she will revamp with more spices. The staff don't hover and they kind of just leave you alone. A nice touch at the end of the meal when they give you toothpicks, hand wipes, and Andes mints with your check. Next time I'll take the Mr and see if they deserve another star.
The take out is decent if you live in Magnolia and are in a bind. If I didn't live in Magnolia I probably wouldn't eat here that much. I am giving an extra star because of convenience and a few times I have dined in have been 4 star. I have had the phad thai and showering rama. The ingredients are good but nothing to write home about. One thing is they get your food out pretty dang fast making it good for a quick lunch. There is definately better Thai places in this city. Also, their history with the department of health is less than stellar. This place was the epitome of 'okay.'I ordered a beef curry, honestly can't remember which one. &#160;It was okay. &#160;Super heavy on zucchini. &#160;We're talking like 60% zucchini -- truly unheard of zucchini levels.I asked for 5 star spicy...I said I liked 'really spicy' and made knowing eye-contact with the waiter. &#160;Of course it wasn't anywhere close to spicy. &#160;I think 5 stars just means one extra shake of crushed red pepper into the curry.Still, not bad. &#160;I wouldn't discourage anyone from going here, but I think if you look at the the people waiting outside of El Ranchon, the full tables at Ichiro and then see that this place is ALWAYS empty that might be a pretty good indication of where it sits in the Magnolia restaurant pecking order.On the plus side I learned how to spell zucchini by writing this review. &#160;Z-U-C-C-H-I-N-I. &#160;Thanks Kinnaree Thai!
Funny that this Ale House is more of a kid-friendly family eatery than anything else. Kids can and do run a bit wild in here while parents by and large ignore them. Fine if you have your own with you.I don't have too much memory of the food, except that we all ate. I prefer to teach my kids restaurant manners when dining out, so I'll skip this one next time.
I've always dreamed of having a "place" and by place, I mean that restaurant or coffee shop where when you walk in, you don't even have to order because they already know what you want. And rather than asking you about how you like your coffee or whether or not you want a side of rice, they ask you about your dog or how the camping trip was. When I walk into Greenwood Mandarian, I feel like someday (with persistence and a lot of great tipping) it could be that place. I love that this is so wholly a neighborhood restaurant. They've been there forever and they don't have to waste their time on looks or decor (and trust me, they don't) because they make great food and they have loyal customers. Under the glass toppers on each table are hundreds (dare I say, thousands?) of business cards, movie stubs, personal notes, and generally anything one could find when cleaning out one's wallet. It's like a trip down memory lane -- even if they are not you're memories -- and bonus points if you spot someone you know. Ok - the food - I'm getting there. I love the food. I fell in love with Mu Shu Pork at the Greenwood Mandarian. Prawns and Broccoli (although I suggest ordering with extra garlic) are another favorite. Oh, and the Vegetable Chow Mein. We usually order two entrees and are out of there for about $16 -- doesn't get much better than that, eh? All in all -- great food and a whole lot of quirky make Lindsey a happy girl. A solid 3 stars, could be 4 but gads the lack of service makes me want to take this stuff TOGO!!Been frequenting this place over the years, between a few ownership changes not much as been done to the olde place, it could use a good scrubbing and for heavens sake DO NOT look under your table...After hounding our waitress to come take our order the food did come out rather promptly, granted it was 7PM, then again I must say the place was rather full. &#160;They seem to do a brisk take-out business, food portions and favor, for a Chinese restaurant outside of the International district of Seattle AKA China-town, it's pretty darn good. &#160;Back in the day we'd always order the sizzling rice soup, we passed this time because of the weather. &#160;It was just too darn hot outside, and for that matter inside the restaurant too! &#160;They have a small over head AC unit, looking at the amount of dust and grease collected on it, I was just as glad they didn't fire that baby up. &#160;With the door open you could hear and smell Greenwood Ave outside, that includes the smoke from the tavern goers next door. &#160;It wasn't bad but something to note.Great favor in each dish, I'd go back just for the Mongolian beef. &#160;The only real miss was the Honey Walnut Prawns. &#160;Too few prawns and way to much mayo. &#160;Other than that it's worthy of a re-visit or take-out. Went here on a whim a month or so back. I've been living in the Greenwood area for 8 years now and I have been by this place a hundred times and never been in. I figured any place that has been in one area for that amount of time HAS to be doing something right. The place looks like a serious dump on the outside, and I gotta tell ya....I should have just turned right around with the GF and went somewhere else when I saw how bad things looked from 5 feet away. The outside appearance had already "sunk" any hopes my GF had for the place and I was starting to get a little skeptical as we got to the entrance.The interior may have been worse than the outside. &#160;This place has probably been here minimum of 20 years and you can tell that very little money (if any) has been put back into the upkeep of the restaurant and it's appearance. Leaky air conditioning unit, a pillar in the middle of the floor attached to the celing looked like it had seen better days, RIDICULOUSLY old and uncomfortable booths with some tears here and there.....On top of the rickety and outdated interior, the lighting was HORRENDOUS (I'm kind of a lighting type guy) The lights were SO bright, they accented every little flaw and filthy corner in the place, as well as create uncomfortable atmosphere! So much for mood lighting.Man, my GF was completely lost to me by the time it was ready to order. We were both hungry, so we just tried to not judge a book by it's cover and go for it. I was hoping this would be one of those jewels you sometimes find at hole-in-the-walls.The food and service didn't help matters at all.My GF had Sweet N Sour Chicken that was cold and way too heavy on the canned sweet n' sour mix. My Broccoli Beef was FAIR and the prices were decent for Chinese, but &#160;things certainly were not good enough to justify spending any more time in this obviously neglected building with it's awful ambiance. The older woman we had serving us was fairly friendly, but her hygiene was suspect. After we had ordered our dinner, she sat at a booth kitty-corner to us with what looked like family, and began to eat with them and clear their plates (there were 4 children carrying on and being obnoxious and creating a giant mess). &#160;She juggled this with serving us and a few other tables AND bussing and cleaning tables all without washing her hands ONCE. It was seriously gross and unprofessional.We were glad to be done with our Greenwood Mandarin experience by the time the check arrived. I work right by Greenwood Mandarin. They offer some super-cheap lunch specials that are really quite good. They use lots of fresh veggies. The decor is wretched though. I get my orders to go. I've been going here for about 10 years now. It's my local Chinese restaurant and the food is consistent and tasty. Granted I don't vary what I order here too much. Hot-n-sour soup, Mu Shu (pork or veggie) and Ma Po Tofu. Service can be on the more challenging side, part of this adds to the distinctiveness of the restaurant. If you catch the waitress on a good day (like I did yesterday) you'll get service with a smile. Other nights, service is more like the Seinfeld soup-nazi. But all in all the food is good, prices are cheap and I've really never had something I didn't like here. Atmosphere is early 80's remodel and could use a little update. The business cards and wallet innards stored under glass provide some entertainment while you eat your food.
We ordered delivery. Due to arcane Washington state liquor laws, Lucky 8 cannot allow any beverage to leave the premises, even when it's the delivery of non-alcoholic beverages. BUMMER! I missed out on the special ginger beer and will have to visit in person some time. We had chicken fried rice, which had large pieces of real chicken breast, tender long beans, spicy tofu with vegetables, and general Tso's chicken. The spicy tofu, while the spiciest of the entrees, was not overwhelming by any means. Tso's chicken was good, with a more complex and richer flavor than many Tso's I've had in the past. I look forward to going in to a sit down dinner at Lucky 8's sometime, just so I can get to try the damned ginger beer! I'm amazed Lucky 8 wasn't crowded when we went in on Friday at 8. &#160;This place has great service, perfectly inauthentic Chinese food, actually spicy things that are labeled spicy, and shockingly good tofu. &#160;I look forward to getting my leftovers to go and then eating them almost immediately again soon. Came here for a birthday party which involved copious amounts of alcohol and karaoke. The host was awesome, and was one of the better karaoke experiences I've had (but that could also be due to the crowd and our *awesome* song choices).The restaurant itself is sort of small-- I guess not too surprising, it's Cap Hill. But it was so crowded, our party was awkwardly hanging out near the cash register since there was no seats (at the time, it was also HH, which they have a pretty good one twice a day. yay!)The bathroom situation was weird, especially if you had too many drinks. I couldn't tell the sex of the random asian statutes on the doors, but luckily they're both uni-sex so I guess pick your poison :PI didn't end up ordering any food, but it honestly reeked of grease and the majority of their menu involves some sort of frying. Also, they seem to cater more towards trendy asian cuisine like P.F. Changs which isn't really my thing, but the karaoke was fun! I really wanted to like this place. The decor is cool. The kung fu movies playing in the background are great. Delivery? I love delivery.Unfortunately, our food was a mixed bag and the service even more so. My dining companion ordered a diet Coke. It arrived and was completely flat. He told our server and his response was "Yeah, it's weird... everybody complains about that. It's coming from a 2 liter bottle vs. a tap." If you're getting multiple complaints about something, wouldn't that indicate that it might be worth considering a change? Cans are more expensive, but they're not *that* much more expensive. Or you could just get the syrup and make it yourself, which would be cheaper than 2 liter bottles. After explaining that, he departed. No offer to comp the drink or exchange it. It appeared on the bill even though it was never touched again.My entree (vegetarian) was the better of the two... it was simple and plain. The other was pronounced nearly inedible. Cool space with an inexpensive build out that has endearing camp charm. Needs some more deep fryer grease smoke to properly cure the new space however. Who wants to stand outside a surrounding restaurant for 45 minutes on a Friday when you can eat well here? Had two disappointments here. First is that I didn't have more room to eat any further. Second, the crab Rangoon was too petite. Entrees were solid. Sweet sour pork, sesame beef, duck lo mein. Very ducky...dynamite. I'm a bartender. And, I'm frequently disappointed with dining in Seattle. People settle and rave for mediocrity in this town. How about having some food that's fun? I see there are mixed reviews for Lucky 8's. I could see how this could not be your jam. My first thoughts were 1. I don't like Chinese food, and 2. This looks like a boys clubhouse. But it turned out I loved it and go there are the time now, love when that happens.Being a vegetarian the dishes are simple but superb. I think some even qualify as vegan. I can pay the same price for much less food that is only so-so/crap with MSG at the Asian restuaraunt by my house or come here and actually enjoy myself. The drinks and happy hour aren't bad either, if you can manage the parking. My one recommendation would be the untapped market of the tropical fruity cocktail. You know the kind, flowers, pineapples, FRILLS, and rum you can't taste til you hit the floor. They have one(Buddha's breath?) and it really is good, but since no where in Seattle does it I think they could really monetize on it. Came back to Lucky 8's on Saturday evening--once again, great food, great service, and great experience. Granted, there are a number of pricier dining experiences just around the corner, but our evening out on Capitol Hill was about getting out and meeting friends for drinks at nearby bars. When we got to that point of the evening when we were ready for a bite, Lucky 8's fit the bill perfectly as usual. The fire dragon shrimp and Chinese green beans were fantastic, and just the right amount so we could feel satisfied and move on with our evening without feeling stuffed.This place is a welcome addition to the restaurant scene on Cap Hill, and I hope they stick around. **GOOD, but not great food**It's close to my house, so of course I'll be back. They offer delivery service.. Space is beautiful. So the decor is great and location sweet. &#160;Server was very kind and did a good job, food came out fast. &#160;But really, that's not the point of eating. &#160;Maybe of "going out."My drink tasted like what I imagine bad cologne does. &#160;The friend I was with commented that she was able to finish hers once the ice diluted the poor flavor. Starter was alright, thanks to a familiar store bought sweet sauce. &#160;The entrees were completely lacking flavor. &#160;The ingredients tasted fresh, but overall both of our dishes fell completely flat. &#160;It's hip and trendy, but neither the food nor the drinks did anything for the palate. &#160;They didn't even justify the mediocre ticket price. &#160;Honestly I'm really surprised by the number of higher reviews on here. Dramatic, rich wood and industrial meets trendy Americana China House. Great pricing for finger foods known in red PRC, prepared by the hands of West Coast hipster foodies. Cabbage rolls, Spring rolls, Pork Boa, Gai Lan, Satay Skewers and more. Spicy, venom-filled wonders that are carefully crafted. Crispy, rich, soft or marbled the menu is rather special for a Happy Hour-friendly eatery. Dragon's and 8 balls and Buddha collide under a warehouse style roof. Nice bar and standing height wooden table railing for mingling. Attentive service, smiling faces. They cater in-house parties, too. Order to go and get your order via bike! The floor is perfect for dancing. We got delivery. &#160;It was fast and the delivery person was super nice.Bao was good. &#160;Fried rice was good, though had kind of a 'sweet' flavor to it? &#160;Egg rolls were not so good, and were soggy. &#160;Fortune cookies were very stale. &#160;Main dishes were pretty flavorful.Overall pretty on par for chinese delivery in Seattle (not great, not awful). &#160;We'll probably try it one more time. I love this place- different from anything else on the hill. &#160; We had great egg rolls, Pork Bao and Dragon Fire Shrimp.... Everything was Spicy! &#160; The only thing we didn't love was the won ton soup. &#160; Our server turned out to also be the owner... he was very attentive. &#160; We had a great experience all around and will be back! I got an order of food to go, and I was very happy with Lucky 8. Ok, it's maybe not the most authentic Asian food you'll ever have, but it's a lot less greasy and salty than other Chinese Food places in Seattle. Plus, they serve food until 1am which is a huge plus for me since I'm a late night owl and often get hungry at midnight. The staff was friendly and the food came out quickly. Overall, a win. The five stars is for the drinks &amp; customer service. &#160;Those are excellent! But, I'm with some of the other Yelpers - the food needs MAJOR work! &#160;When you can taste Frank's Red Hot Sauce in the Spicy Beef, or when your side of white rice is grainy MINUTE rice, time to rework the menu! &#160;The crab Rangoon wasn't bad. &#160;I guess I expected more. Great Lighting, yummy and inexpensive appetizers, friendly staff and an open and airy space makes this place a definite find! :) Love this little place. The menu is solid, but the real magic is in the happy hour / late night menu. The bao and ribs are delicious, and probably the best I've ever had. Great service and never too busy. I love Lucky 8's.In fact, it is my new favorite restaurant on the Hill.I have now eaten in the restaurant and taken advantage of their delivery service. &#160;I have had the General Tsao's Chicken, the Sweet and Spicy Beef, and the Sesame Beef. &#160;All three dishes were fantastic! &#160;Full of flavor, moist and tender, and reasonably priced. &#160;The staff is so nice too. &#160;Very friendly, patient, and attentive. &#160;I noticed most of the negative/mediocre reviews so far occurred closer to when they opened. &#160;Perhaps they had a few kinks to work out, and it seems they have, because I have had zero issues with this place so far and will be back for more very, very soon! This place is great.Every time I've been, the staff has been awesome and the food has been wonderful. That is so refreshing from most other places in Cap Hill.The Lucky Tso's Chicken is my favorite. It's not the healthiest thing on the menu, but it is very good... And let's face it, Chinese food isn't exactly known as "health food." It sure does hit the spot though.I think most of their ingredients are organic and sustainable. Ask the staff about it and I'm sure they'll tell you about what the use in their food.The place clean, new and fresh. The cocktail menu is inventive. Try something new! Just had my third dinner from Lucky 8 (one in-house &amp; two deliveries), and I keep wondering why I don't eat there more. The Dragon Fire Shrimp were great, and I love the Lucky Tsao's Chicken and the Sesame Beef. The bike delivery is a nice bonus for us neighborhood folk, too. Lucky indeed! I came here with my friend for dinner this evening. The restaurant is situated on 14th avenue and when you walk in you immediately walk down a flight of stairs. We were confused. It looked like they were setting up for a party (there were multiple metal trays that were placed in the middle of the (small) restaurant). Turns out there was going to be a party going on soon. We sat down and there were a few things that I noticed during the 15 LONG MINUTES we waited until we ordered: I was the only asian person in this Chinese Restaurant, staff included! I mean, I don't mean to sound a certain way... but damn! Another thing that I saw was a very large recreation of a Chinese-to-go-box, which was situated on a ledge near the ceiling--SUUUUPER ASIAN, and I'm not sure if I liked that. Also there was a lot of red color incorporated in the restaurant, especially a floor to ceiling wall that had multiple "8" wooden blocks on the wall--again, super asian. I dunno, it was to the point that they were shoving all of these asian-esque things to our face to the point where it was pretentious/uncalled for. Another thing I noticed was how hot it was. The space had poor circulation, and granted, Seattle is hardly this hot on a normal day, but I was just really uncomfortable during my time there--sweating profusely... ugh over itOkay, so after we ordered I took a sip of water (which was room temperature--it'd been nice to have a cold glass of water to counter the insane non-circulated hot air in the room) and I noticed that the rim of the glasses tasted a bit salty. I dunno if they didn't clean the glass thoroughly, but it tasted salty. -_-We got our food. I was not impressed. The garlic shrimp was pretty much a stir-fry which had too much "filler" in it. Like, the dish was 85% veggies and 15% shrimp. The shrimp tasted good, when I tried it... The steamed hum bao had a very dry exterior and a bitter inside (the braised pork was not so good)--I've definitely had better. The Garlic Bok choy was good, I liked it. I checked in with Yelp and found out that I got a free "Big Buddha" beer! That was nice to receive.Oh yeah, and once that party arrived in the (small) restaurant space, my friend and I were the only one's not part of the party. Awkward!Overall, I was really not impressed with the restaurant and my experience there. I probably won't go back until I hear better things through Yelp. The only reason why it's not a 1 star, is because the bok choy was good and I got a free beer. I'd say, if you want better "Asian Fusion" food...go a few blocks to Boom Noodle... Lucky 8 is awesome. Food is yummy, decor is great, and they deliver - and it's fast!!Great cocktails too.Plus, as a veggie they have great options and you can order just about anything on the menu and they'll make it veg. It's a hidden gem in a sea of overpriced attitude food. This place is great! It has a great comfortable feel with lots of red and wood decor, but that's really secondary to the food. I couldn't tell you how 'authentic' anything they make is, as I am from Seattle land void of good Chinese, but I really enjoyed everything. The spare ribs were Flinstone sized and super tasty and tender, duck dumplings were crispy and flavorful, and the Confucius chicken was tasty with just a little kick. The staff is super friendly and they bike deliver if you live nearby. We had 4 plates and a couple glasses of bubbles and left stuffed and only $40 poorer, will definitely be back! Stopped by here for happy hour -not bad! I can't comment on the food orders, as I just had a couple of cocktails and the braised pork bao. Hey, it was solid. We didn't mean to end up at Lucky 8's, but we had a pleasant dinner. I liked the casual atmosphere. The decor was modern and clean but inviting. The red lit interior was open with tall ceilings. I was happy that the prices allowed me to order a couple of appetizers, which were the highlight of the meal. &#160;Spicy-sweet glazed short ribs came with in generous portion and hit the perfect spot for the meaty craving that I brought. The pork shoulder boa was perfectly doughy. I think the pork was braised in milk, so perfectly tender. &#160;Our service was attentive, timely, and accommodating. &#160;We had the Lucky's Tsoa chicken which had a tender meat and lighter breading than I am used to. I didn't mind the different texture but found the dish to be under-sauced. Additionally, there were strips of carrot which were basically raw, but were large enough to be hard to chew. &#160;The carrot was visually appealing, but should have been cooked more. &#160;The duck lo mein was fine, but a little flat. Again with the crunchy carrots. I ordered a side of baby bok choy, and found it to be oily and lacking depth of flavor.I feel like I am being overly critical. Like I said I enjoyed it. It was reasonably priced. &#160;I would definitely recommend the ribs and the bao. &#160;Maybe this young restaurant is work another trip. Excellent American Chinese restaurant. I've eaten happy hour in and I've ordered take out. The happy hour menu was great. I really liked the ribs (they were HUGE) I could have made a small meal out of them. Good thing I shared. Only complaint, why can't anyone deliver to Madrona. Come on guys! Still haven't tried the dumplings that everyone keeps raving about, bu that's because they're always out of them. More dumplings guys!Restaurant inside is ikea trendy looking, so people who are afraid of the ID's dank restaurants can rest assured. Wow! My boyfriend and I popped in here while waiting for some friends last night. &#160;We were greeted as soon as we bellied up to the bar I tried to order my usual shot and beer combo and the bartender suggested a strawberry mojito it sounded good so what the hell? That was one of the best choices I've made in a londg time. &#160;It was perfect not too sweet, not over muddled, not to chunky. &#160;It was the meaning of refreshment. &#160;we sat down and enjoyed our bevvies and a very friendly server came by and let us know it was about to be happy hour we were not super hungry at this time but after we looked at the menu we decided to get something. &#160;I ordered the spicy shrimp and because I have many food allergies I only mentioned the wheat in soy sauce because that is usually the main one and my sesame allergy totally slipped my mind on this . &#160;so he made sure they used the gluten-free soy sauce but there were sesame seeds all upon it. &#160;I felt so bad but I told him I forgot to mention the sesame allergy then I gave him the list of all the others just to make sure. &#160;I mean it was only a 5 dollar entree and I have been in the service business for years I knew i was bein a pain in the ass. &#160;The Chef was off duty and he went back to the kitchen and made up a tasty soy,chili,ginger and fresh veggies sweet and spicy dish custom for me. &#160;It was so delicious and made my night . &#160;They went out of their way to ensure we had a lovely experience. &#160;We will be back for sure. check this place out for dinner or happy hour you will be pleased! I have to say that given the unreal amount of Asian restaurants there are to choose from in Seattle, you would be hard-pressed to find one that meets all of your dinning needs. &#160;But... &#160; I think I just might have the answer. Lucky 8's. When i first entered (besides the delicious smell) &#160;i was welcomed by the Chef and a very friendly staff. After sitting at the bar and taking a look around, what a great place. the &#160;woodwork, and the overall comfortable feel of the place really works! Just when i thought it couldn't get any better the food came...OK, i know that an egg roll is a fairly &#160;simple thing but these were perfect, not oily or soggy just right. I also had the ribs and to be honest they are just on another level succulent meaty and the sauce incredible! My main course was the Generel Tsao's chicken ans i have to say the Chef hit the mark again with this one. I will definitely be back and i HIGHLY recommend that you try it out for yourself.So there it is, your answer for great Asian food in Seattle. Lucky 8's
Horrible service! &#160;Ordered 3 different things and was told they didn't have it. Then why is your front door unlocked? &#160;Why do you have someone working who's attitude is so poor you have the physical reaction of "I can't get out of here fast enough" pulsing through ones veins?Please, do us and yourself a huge favor and close. Go become the mayor of Seattle, not like that is a real career advancement.
We've had their pho here, and it's not bad (though certainly not the best I've had in Seattle). &#160;The interior is prettyshabby, but I've learned not to care much about that in these sorts of joints because I'm definitely not dining for the experience.For the non-Pho things on the menu, however, I would probably want to advise against. &#160;The BF and I ordered their spring rolls and the vermicelli as takeout and based on that meal, we have to take a star away. The rice noodles were firm firm firm as if they were cooked long ago but have hardened, the spring rolls were pretty flimsy, and the portion sizes were somewhat lacking. Might want to look for another pho place along Rainier.
My fiance and I went there for the first time on a Wednesday night to celebrate his new job. &#160;We immediately liked the place- it's small, simple but romantic, and cozy, and we felt right at home. &#160;Our server was friendly and attentive, but never pushy or intrusive. &#160;This place has a good selection of wine and a small-but-full bar, and I could totally see this place being a neighborhood/industry hangout after the restaurant closes. &#160;The menu is pretty reasonable. &#160;For appetizer, we ordered the braised pork belly... YUM! &#160;It was cooked to perfection, and we savored every bite. &#160;All we could say was ahhs and ohhs :) &#160;The timing for the appetizer and the main course was good, not rushed but not kept too long. &#160;For the main course, we had the seared scallop risotto and the lamb shank, both of which were delicious, though slightly on the saltier side. &#160;The lamb fell off the bone, and the scallops and the risotto was creamy but not too heavy. &#160;The peach tarte with creme fraiche ice cream was a nice light finish to our meal. &#160;Everything was super delicious and the friendly server definitely added to the experience, too. &#160;We enjoyed our whole dining experience. &#160;We will definitely be back again. Good food, good service and a nice location. The portions were not huge but all you needed. Chicken was se of the best I have had. Gnocchi were fantastic and the Damon was good too. The wine list was not overpriced and we were able to find several choices to our liking. The one negative was the restaurant was cold. Maybe it was I spent the day riding my bike but I wished that I had worn a sweater. Lots of glass and opening door did not help. Still with the addition of warm clothes I will be back. Quaint little spot in upper Queen Anne. Walked in with no particular expectations but had a really great experience. 7:30 reservations and we were seated right away. The restaurant is small, bright and cozy.. great for a special occasion, or in my case, a first date. We ordered the cote de boeuf which was great for sharing as there was plenty of food. &#160;Food presentation was great, service wasn't spectacular but allowed us our time to enjoy our meal. I would dine here again some time in the future. I too used to love Portage. While the service and atmosphere is good, the food disappoints. The chef makes random changes to the items listed on the menu. Which would be fine, but you are not told in advance. During our recent dinner, I ordered a salad in which the chef substituted the listed cheese for goat cheese. He did remake the salad, but one wonders why he would do that when there already was an endive salad with goat cheese on the menu. And another appetizer with goat cheese as well. The seared scallops were good, the potato risotto is tasteless (and once again contains goat cheese). The real killer was the pear tarte tartin, the pastry was burned, chewy and with no taste. i honestly do not know if there was a pear or not. &#160;I suspect that with the opening with their second restaurant, the owners are not paying attention to the QA location. What a shame. i shall not be returning, there are just too many restaurants that deliver better food (and better value - Portage is not inexpensive). My husband and I went to Portage with a friend of ours for Seattle Restaurant Week. &#160;We love trying out new restaurants, and Restaurant Week is a good way to try some of the more expensive restaurants at a more reasonable price to see if we like them. &#160;Portage will definitely not be on our list of places to revisit.Our original reservation was for 8:15pm, but they called us about an hour ahead of time to let us know they were running a bit behind, and we should show up at 8:30. &#160;Fair enough, and we appreciated the warning that they were running late. &#160;So we showed up at 8:30 and they still weren't ready for us, so we had to cram into their tiny bar area to wait. &#160;We sat there for about 10 minutes more, though no one ever offered us a drink or to see a menu. &#160;Still, these things can happen, it was busy, we understood. &#160;We finally got seated at our table, but then the waiter never came by for our drink order. &#160;They proceeded to clear and reset several tables around us. &#160;Other people came in and sat down at the newly set tables, and a waiter went over to take their drink orders. &#160;At this point, we were starting to get a bit annoyed, since we'd been sitting there for about 15 minutes and no one had taken our drink orders yet. &#160;The waiter finally made it to us and took our drink orders and said he would be "right back" to take our food order. &#160;He was gone for 10 minutes. &#160;We *finally* got our food ordered, but by the time we actually got it, we were starving (it was well over an hour after our original reservation). &#160;I understand that it was busy because of Restaurant Week, but there were only about 10 tables in the whole place and there were 3 servers. &#160;It really shouldn't have taken them so long for any of this.The food was good, though not certainly amazing. &#160;Without the bad service, I still probably wouldn't have been back, but I wouldn't have bothered to review it on Yelp either. &#160;I'd say the food is probably worth about 3.5 stars.The thing that really killed me is that they included a 20% gratuity in the check. &#160;Now, maybe this is their policy for Restaurant Week, but it didn't state that anywhere on the menu. &#160;(There were only 3 of us and I've never seen required gratuity on anything less than parties of 6 more more.) &#160;I was really annoyed that they just assumed that they'd earned 20%, because they most certainly hadn't. &#160;I normally tip 20% for average service, but this was far below. &#160;I probably would have gone with more like 15%, but whatever. &#160;They've just ensured that we'll never return. Went to Portage last night with a group of 8 people. We all LOVED it!!! Everybody ordered different stuff, including their tasting menu. And I gotta say it was sooo delicious. My New York Strip, my husband's duck, sides, soup, dessert! We really enjoyed our experience. I think this place is good for both friends night out and a romantic date. Good job, guys! Going to recommend Portage to all my friends. The food was excellent. Kudos to the chef. All the dishes we ordered turned out fantastic. The service was so-so. In fact, I remember it being a little slow, especially for a weekday night when the restaurant wasn't full. Whatever it is, I'll definitely be back for another meal. I have to say that this is a great place to have a long, cozy, romantic dinner. Now, I know next to nothing about French food but I know what my taste buds like and they LOVE this place. I was really looking forward to our dinner at Portage because I had heard such great things about the restaurant, but we were very disappointed. &#160;We started with the beet gratin, which was okay, but not spectacular - the Roquefort was a bit overpowering - the dish would have been better served with a milder blue cheese. &#160;Then we had the gnocchi, which, though not described as such, was fried, and served with some greens that were over-salted. &#160;Then we had creme caramel for dessert, which was liberally coated in salt...again, not quite as listed on the menu. &#160; To add insult to injury, when we got our check, a 20% tip had already been added (for a table of 2), and our service was not that good (we had our credit cards sitting on the table for 15 minutes before they brought our check). &#160;We won't be going back. &#160;There are a number of great restaurants in Queen Anne - there's no reason to settle for less than stellar.
Firstly...total fan! &#160;I took a friend there last week and we had a really pleasant time. &#160;There are so many things to say about this place that are good, I'm not sure where to begin. &#160;Let's start with the food. &#160;We ordered a salad and some beet concoction that were both really good. &#160;The beet thing didn't seem too Italian, but it was still incredible and I'll be the first to admit that one trip to Italy doesn't make me an expert on what is Italian cuisine. &#160;The pizza we ordered was also great. &#160;We got the quattro fromaggi pizza with tomatoes and basil, which was perfect.Before dinner, we decided to try the Grappa. &#160;I had had Grappa in Italy and really didn't like it when I was there, but people change. &#160;I thought I'd give it a shot. &#160;We ordered a 3 variety sampler and had the bar tender pick it out for us. &#160;I thought it was all pretty disgusting still, but my friend thought it was good. &#160;She managed two of the glasses of it and I took the one that tasted the least like pine needles and novocaine.I'll try it again in another couple years. &#160;There were a few different people helping us. &#160;I'm not sure which one was our waiter. &#160;There was a gentleman with longer hair and well-trimmed facial hair. &#160;He was very cheerful and helpful and gave me a few pointers on the best way to approach Grappa after what I imagine was a pretty disgusted look he saw on my face. &#160;There was a woman who actually took our order and was pretty enthusiastic in a contagious sort of way.Then there was this other woman who would just kind of check on us every once in a while. &#160;All of them, great.Also...the Tiramisu! &#160; It's like what Jesus should have turned the water into. &#160;Miraculous! &#160;Perfect! &#160;Almost sinfully good! &#160;Maria claims it's a lot like the Tiramisu she makes, but if that's the case going to start placing orders!My only complaint about the place is that it's pretty loud. &#160;There is no noise dampening anywhere in the place, so if you're with someone who is pretty soft-spoken it can be difficult to hear them over the noise of the restaurant--not impossible, but just a difficult. &#160;Bring your loud friends here! &#160; If you're hear with quiet friends, ask for a corner table. Forgive me Yelp, for I have sinned. It has been 45 reviews since my last confession (seriously, don't go back and count... that was an ambiguous number pulled straight from my ass.) My initial review was colored by the ardour of new love. While that love still fills my heart (and my martini/cocktail/WHATEVERGODJUSTLETMEWRITETHEREVIE&#173;W glass), my appreciation for Tutta Bella has waned.The crust is so thin that within minutes the entire pizza is reduced to a flat, sloppy mess. You can't pick it up; you have to use a fork or the entire thing ends up in your lap. The ingredients may or may not be fresh, but unfortunately most of the slices I've had have lacked much flavor. It's a good idea, but not very well executed. For a restaurant that has a reputation for being kid-friendly, I'm surprised that there is no diaper changing station in the ladies restroom. &#160;2 stars! &#160;Maybe next time we go I'll just change babies diapers at the table. &#160;That will change other patrons' minds about getting chocolate hazelnut gelato. Soggy terribleness. &#160;Stone way location did it right...this one was a stinker at least on this visit. &#160;And the server could have cared less prancing around like she was something special. &#160;Special Ed. perhaps? In the hugely diverse coffee catalog Seattle has to offer, Caff&#233; Cioccolato from Tutta Bella is my favorite coffee beverage in our dear city. A creamy concoction of espresso, Nutella and steamed milk (which I only drink when I go to Tutta Bella), Caff&#233; Cioccolato is one of the few things that haunts me constantly while I'm night or daydreaming. &#160;Countless times, I've found myself uncontrollably drooling over the though of sitting in front of a steamy cup with the cute chocolate rosetta in front of me. &#160;I adore it. I long for it. I won't comment on the food, as The Dude and I stopped here after happy hour at Barolo only for some coffee. &#160;They have their own happy hour and offer wine and beer and several Italian finger food options, including their popular pizza bianca with marinara sauce (delicious at their Wallingford restaurant).In this opportunity, service was really warm and personal. Our server, Ashley, made our coffee time experience a very nice one. She was lively, fast and friendly. &#160;Five stars to her. I liked some elements on this location--gorgeous sight of the Space Needle, and a very promising patio. It's a bit impersonal, but the windows somehow make it up for it.This said, I need to "yell" to get this message to Tutta Bella's management: WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH THE NOISE? &#160;We asked our server and she told us they were working on fixing the duct, and that's why it was so noisy. &#160;It was definitely annoying but as I told her "we'll be here for less than an hour...how do you guys manage to work in this environment?" She was very professional when it came to explaining the situation and offered an apology. &#160;I felt sorry for them. &#160;I'd be pulling my hair if I had to be there for more than 30 minutes, let alone working! &#160;Even though I like Tutta Bella's food and as said before, it feels like I'm going to heaven every time I had their Caff&#233; Cioccolato, the noise will definitely keep me from coming back to this location. &#160;It was beyond bearable. &#160;I'd be happy to give them the number for a fantastic acoustical firm that would be delighted to help them with this issue. &#160;I truly hope they sort this out.For now, I'll go back to Wallingford to sip on that wonderful little tazza de amore che mi piace molto! It's probably because I'm not Italian that I can confidently say that I'm not a fan of "real" artisan pizza. I mean, I've been to Italy and have had "real" pizza. Don't get me wrong, it's very good. Tutta Bella does a better than par job of recreating authenticity. But you know what? On the box of a Costco take-and-bake pizza you'll find "Artisan Pizza" emblazoned on it. Does that mean it's more authentic than Tutta? Of course not. Would I rather have Costco's pizza? (5 times as much for 1/5th of the price)...yes, yes I would. Our office is right next door, so after about a week, I got over my Whole Foods love affair, and started looking for a change of pace -- we were ecstatic when Tutta Bella showed up. &#160;The food's always really solid (great salads, flatbread pizza, etc.) and the service is always quick -- probably isn't what I'd call a wonderful 5-star restaurant, but for great/quick/fun food and nice location, I'd give this place 4-thumbs up. The first reason to go to Tutta Bella is because the food is SO GOOD!! But I'll delve into that in a second..I went to Tutta Bella (not the first time) on Saturday night. I had attempted to hit up 3 other restaurants but it was 6:30PM and everyone had at least a 1 hour wait. My first choice actually told me a 2.5 hour wait! Crazy. Feeling hungrier by the second and almost willing to give up and go to QFC to buy something frozen I thought to check out Tutta Bella. I called them as I was pulling into the parking lot to check out their wait times and they told me it'd be no more than a 15 minute wait.Boy were they right.. we were a party of two and walked right to a table! Perfect.Then there was the food and the service.. as usual it was great. The wait staff has always been super friendly and helpful. I would say the only difference I noticed in their restaurant on a Saturday was that there were a ton of kids and families dining. So what? The food was delicious and I didn't mind that the atmosphere differed from my usual Capitol Hill trendy scenester-type place.I'd recommend the flat bread appetizer as it's really tasty and of course all of the salads and pizzas are great too.I tried their special flavor of pear gelato and was totally blown away. I think it's just a seasonal flavor so it will be rotated out soon. It was just amazing.. it was like the taste of a pear but intensified. Plus it included the grittiness of a real pear and didn't just taste like pear-flavor. I don't think I've had anything as delicious as that in a long time.If you like Neopolitan style pizza, Tutta Bella is a must. Plus, you can get groceries from Whole Foods downstairs on your way home. Super convenient. Amaizing pizza. I recommend one of their salad pizzas. It's such an easy creation yet so good. Their staff has always been friendly no matter what my state of attire has been and this is a pretty nice pizza joint. Negatives: Cold, cafeteria like atmosphere with high unfinished ceilings and loud echoes throughout. &#160;Waitress with a whole bunch of attitude.Positive: Pretty yummy pizza, and really quick!I think if I were to come again I would just go for lunch or maybe drinks and snacks before dinner. It is just really lacking on the scene part. I love pizza. But frequently I don't love the pizza that I eat. I look for a good flavorful sauce and a crust that isn't the flavor and texture of cardboard. I LOVE Tutta Bella's pizza. You can taste all of the ingredients without drowning in grease. The crust itself has a really nice flavor without dominating the pie like thick crusts do.If they would just improve the quality of their desserts, I'll up my rating to 5 stars. nice little thin-sliced gourmet pizza restaurant. very personable waitstaff (although they were a little disjointed because they were a little busy.ordered the bottle of wine on "special", and they were out. asked for an alternative and the manager came over and tried to upsell us on something else. we said "no" and asked for a price break. he obliged without much resistance. classy, and what a great bottle of vino!food was tasty, but familiar (don't know why...perhaps because the pizza tasted like something i used to get at Trader Joes). coffee was nice and strong. ice cream was a little disappointing/misleading, but hell, we had a very nice evening after all. I've only had pizza at the Stone Way and the Westlake location. &#160;My wife and I agree that we think the pizza is better at the Westlake location. &#160;I think it's consistently good and doesn't disappoint.We love the crust and the variety of unique toppings. &#160;We had the special last week and it was the best! &#160;We always get either the caesar and napoli salad - both large and fresh.Very kid friendly - which is good for us with our 2 year old.Living on the Eastside, we'll settle for Pagliacci when shopping at Bell Square, but make it a point to drive to Seattle when we really want to eat pizza. Very clean, very dead. This was also a Sunday night but there was literally 5 staff members standing around. We had 3 different people greet our table before our actual server helped us. At first we felt bad because we thought they were closing down. But that was not the case. The two ladies that saw our table were a little rude. We were short and quick to leave. The gentleman who ended up being our server was great! Very nice and prompt. The food was good. I was surprised at the inexpensive pricing. The pizza is very thin crust though and will moderately fill the stomachs of two people. The food came very fast and I was impressed. I warn people who are looking for traditional pizzas to check it out first before ordering. Its a very different pizza. I loved it, but I can see where some people would not. I will return. Especially with the great prices. This was one of the better wood-fired stove Italian Pizza places we've been to here in the US; however, nothing compares to the Italian Pizza you get in Naples at Pizzeria Trianon. The service was excellent. The salad was fresh. The pizzas tasted very good and the dough was very good but could have been a bit more crispy. The pizza sauce was authentic and very tasty but a little too thick for this this thin crust italian pizza. Mushrooms and italian sausage were excellent! This is a place we'll have to come back to. Best place to park is underneath for 90 mins free - ask them to validate your parking stub. Great, very authentic Italian PizzaService could be betterGelato is quite goodIf you want good Italian Pizza eat here, If you want service, this is not the place...
Service was barely adequate and the pizza was gross (soggy crust in the middle, way too much cheese and skimpy on the meat topping). Best note of the meal was the greek salad, which was so huge that we barely ate the pizza. &#160;(The take home pizza soaked through the box in addition to fusing with the parchment/wax paper stuff in the bottom.)Definitely won't be back, which honestly is a shame because the location is so convenient.
The French onion soup was extra salty, so was the chipotle sandwich.The not too ripe apple was so tiny that I thought it was a joke.I used to like Panera Bread better when it first came to town. The excitement is gone, if they don't have any more newer improvement. I've only had salad here, but the salad I had was delicious! I will not likely be back for the salad however, as it was almost $9. I got the Strawberry poppy seed chicken salad, which I think is seasonal. It was a mix of spring greens topped with strawberries, blueberries, fresh pineapple, mandarin oranges, pecans and some kind of cheese--feta or Gorgonzola maybe? No dressing, but the fruit were all so juicy, it wasn't missed.I'm not sure how students can afford to eat here, seems more like a real housewives of Seattle type of place. I can make the salad at home, but thanks for the great recipe idea! I love the choices and atmosphere of Panera. They are a lot of Starbucks in decor and atmosphere. They have a wide selection of sandwiches, salads, and soups, along with a huge assortment of pastries and breads &#160;to choose from. After you order, they give you a pager and you just go to the counter when they buzz you. Honestly, I don't even know why they used it. The food usually comes out in a few minutes. Once, they buzzed me while I was still waiting for the cashier to get my lemonade. On a rare day, if the weather's nice in Seattle, this Northgate Panera's outdoor patio is a really nice place to enjoy your good. A great view of the parking lot. But all you have to do is place your pager on the part of the table where it tells you to and they will find you and deliver your food outside. Awesome. My parents keep forcing me to go to this place and everytime I eat here I die a little inside. This restaurant is terrible on a par with Applebees. Quick service. &#160;I love the new electronic location pager you place on your table and delivery of your food. &#160;Always a friendly staff and consistent food. &#160;Be sure to sign up for their Panera card so you can earn points and get free drinks and bakery treats. I ate lunch here today, then I remembered how expensive it is! Not to mention I found a tiny hair in my salad (gross). They also got our order wrong. It was fast, but they forgot our drinks. Tried to bring me the wrong drink, then came out with the correct one. The staff is okay, but not all that friendly/out-going. It's ok, but nothing special. I've only been a few times, but every time I've just found it awkward and uncomfortable. &#160;I get the wrong sized coffee or the pastries aren't in the bag or the soup I ordered was much larger than the soup size I wanted. &#160;It is just enough hassle that I don't really want to come back. It really pains me to have to give Panera a 2-star review because I am such a fan of their food - its light, tasty, and in those moments when you aren't sure if you want one or the other, there they are to give you both at a great deal. &#160;Therefore - this review is completely service-based. &#160;I realize that going there on a Saturday was asking for trouble with all of the people that go to the mall on weekends, but I already needed to go to the area so I figured, 'Why not?'. &#160;I have always had a great experience going there...once or twice during the week I would have lunch there before class to get some study time in or do a little homework and have always been met with very nice and fast service. &#160;Today was unfortunately an exception. &#160;My husband and I walk in and the place is packed but we find two empty tables near the door. &#160;There are two small circular tables and literally 5 chairs between them. &#160;While my husband is ordering, I snag one of the tables. &#160;First a woman decides she needs to park 6 kids at the other table right next to me. &#160;When my husband came back, I asked if there were any other tables available...he says yes but we need to bus it because no one cleaned it and the previous person must have forgotten how to clean up after him/herself. &#160;So, we move-no problem. &#160;So while the Hub is getting our pops, one of the servers comes up to the table with our food and I can only assume he is an Assistant Manager or something but, without one iota of a smile he asks me, "Did you guys move?" &#160;I answered and apologized that yes we had moved. &#160;His response, both very curt and short, "Ok, because I just walked all the way over there and you were gone." &#160;Practically throws our food onto the table and walks away. Okay, #1, we moved like less than 20 feet away. &#160;#2, if you don't want your customers to have the ability to move from their table for a more comfortable area, chain them to it. &#160;The new system they have now is great and all...but if it means not being able to switch seats without getting a snarky remark, I would rather go back to the pager system and be able to up and get my own food. &#160;Needless to say, its the last time I am going to this location. Nice place. I love the broccoli cheddar soup and the mediterranean veggie sandwich. The iced green tea is my absolute favorite along with the sandwich.
They have new waitresses. Not only are the new waitresses responsive, a couple of them are hotties too :)Awesome food served by pretty girls. What more can you ask for ? A mark of a good ethnic food place is the % of their patrons that are from the same part of the world that the food is from. I have never found the local Ethiopian patrons in saba to be below 70% at any given time. That tells you that this food is really authentic, and not an americanized version of something tasty.The food here is delicious and fairly inexpensive. They stay open pretty late to boot! The service is sometimes on the slower side, but we can't all be perfect now, can we? Ate here for first time last weekend and had a good time and enjoyed the food. Menu has plenty of options. My friend and I went for a 4 item combo platter. I found their proteins to be better than their veggie options. Try the Doro Wat &#160;with Chicken - lots of spice and flavor, delicious!Service was pretty good. Very genuine. Our server didn't speak the best English and had a hard time understanding us when we tried to order the wine. I won't hold that against them.When in the mood for Ethiopian again, I would try this place again in a heartbeat. For the record, I AM ETHIOPIAN. And I've rated this place 5 stars. What does that say? This place is WINNING (Charlie Sheen voice of course)! (Oh before I forget, for those of you that are curious because I KNOW some of you are, my aunt, cousin or uncle's wife's daughter in law's great aunt's niece's ex husband does NOT own this place (That family line probably doesn't even make sense lol). No family relations or any relation at all for that matter. The food is just AMAZING! That is all.) This is for my first visit to any Ethopian resturant and the food was good. the green chicken tibs, doro wot were delicious. my veggie friends found less options and overall, the food was little tangy (may be it is supposed to be that way!) Really good food and the experience was wonderful! Kinda dark looking going inside with crowds of people all knowing each other but that didn't faze us. For four people we ordered the combo platter with four different kinds of dishes and altogether it came out to be only $25!! Super cheap and good eats! :) Definitely would be coming back here again! Might be the best Ethiopian food I've had. &#160;Four of us got the combo (kitfo, doro wot, shero wot, and collards). &#160;Kitfo was delicious, though not as flavorful as I would have liked, and the portion was generous. &#160;Doro wot was a little oily and flavorful but not spicy-hot. &#160;The veggie dishes were the standouts. &#160;We got the shero wot with Ethiopian butter and the dish just melted in your mouth with a creamy nuttiness. &#160;The collards were still crunchy and fresh; too often Ethiopian collards are mushy.As others mentioned, you can't beat the price. &#160;Under $40 for the four item combo and two glasses of red wine. The food is great! This place was recommened by an Ethiopian co-worker. It would get 5 stars, but the service is terrible! They take so long, by the time the food comes, you are so hungry you forget to talk to the people you might be with! With that said, call your order in and you won't be disppointed. These guys are really on the ball. &#160;Accurate drink making, great music and it really adds a nice diversity to the area. &#160;Come here if you really want to party down and make a lot of noise. &#160;What is kind of cool about this place is they have a tradition of going outside and yelling randomly. &#160;I suggest you do this if you go here. &#160;It is a ton of fun! Loved the spicy beef tibs, lentils and collard greens! &#160;I came here mainly because a reviewer said they give you a lot of injera. &#160;However, she gave me only one. :( It was the most perfect injera I ever had and I wish that she had given me like 3 to 4 more pieces! Later I did ask for one more piece but felt oddly uncomfortable doing so. &#160;I think it was the vibe of the service. &#160;Anyhow, I'll go back but likely just for a to-go order.
This was the first place I ever had papusas. &#160;Well, you know what they say, you never forget your first. &#160;Of all the places I visited, by far, my favorite papusa place.It can get crowded here, but forge on! &#160;I usually get a veggie papusa and a meat one of sorts. &#160;They are both equally good. &#160;I've never had one I didn't like. Great food, great prices, great service. The pulpulsas were hot, fresh, and made to order. The combo platters can't be beat for $7.50. Excellent hole-in-the-wall place I'll be back to again. I like their mahi mahi taco a lot - big chunks of lightly fried fish topped with refreshing salsa and in doubled wrap corn tortillas. &#160;However, I didn't really like the pupusa - I felt that the tortilla lacked texture and the fillings were pretty bland. &#160;I'm not a pupusa expert though, and it's likely that I just don't like pupusas in general.I'll be returning for the tacos though! I don't come here very often because it's a long walk, but every time I come here I have forgotten how absolutely delicious it is. The pupusas are the PERFECT blend of soft, crunchy, creamy, cheesy, sour, warm, meaty, and cool. Nothing like it in u-district. We intended to go to a nearby restaurant but it was closed. Decided to give this a try because I'd never had Salvadoran food before. First impression upon walking in: you can smell oil frying, but it smells extremely fresh and reassuring, the people who work here are friendly and efficient. All the food was wonderful and interesting though I didn't care for the cole-slaw type salad, it had a lot of thyme in it and was very spicy. Good food, love the Papusas so so good have to try it! The 1st couple of reviews I read here pretty much reflect my sentiments. &#160;This is definitely a "hole-in-the-wall" with order-at-the-counter" service. &#160;It is cozy, however, and the food exceeded my expectations, which were fairly high. &#160;I had the sampler with one taco, one papusa plus rice and beans. &#160;There was also a tasty condiment (salad?) on the side which reminded me of both coleslaw and sour kraut. &#160; The meal was filling, and not too greasy. Veggie Burrito was satisfying. Didn't rock my burrito world. Waiter was nice. Great vegetarian menu; friendly staff, fantastic food. My mouth is still burned and my stomach is still full of pupusas! Such a fantastic eating experience...so many flavors and excellent variety. I ordered vegetarian combo #2 (pupusa, fried yuca, slaw, and empanada). A-MAZING - every single thing. The yuca was the least flavorful, but when dipped in the red or green (or both!) salsas, it came it life. My fiance had the a chicken pupusa and pork tamale and was equally happy. Excellent value for the price, not busy, ample (pay) parking. Here is where I confess that I'm a CA transplant who really misses &#160;the incredible abundance and variety of cheap, delicious ethnic food in San Francisco and Oakland. &#160;Please don't hate me. &#160;The point is, Guanaco's makes me a little less sad for the food I left behind. &#160;Their pupusas are delicious and come in both rice flour and masa versions. &#160;I always ask for extra curtido, &#160;a tangy/spicy cabbage slaw that they make daily with home-made pineapple vinegar. &#160; &#160;Their fried plantains are yummy too! Food was flavorful , homemade hot-sauces were lacking in flavor (which was very disappointing) , portion was mediocre at best. I have no idea what justifies the price. Probably will not return.
Delicious and perfect for what it is: &#160;a place you can walk up and get a slice of pizza after the bars close. &#160;So tasty you might stop by on the way to the bar, and then again later. &#160;Trust me, you'd already have heard about this place if it was the best wood-fired/New York/Chicago or other style for which you pine. &#160;It is not going to fill that hole in your heart.BUT it is also NOT flavorless and ass-y like Dominos, bland in the guise of overly healthy, cardboard-like, petite, overtly greasy, or slow in the arriving. &#160;It is well-balanced and there in your hand, warm like a tiny kitten. &#160;Eat that thing. Pizza Ragazzi for some reason is the best pizza to me, and I am faithful to it. Whenever I eat some other type of pizza I feel like I am cheating on my boyfriend. They have a huge delivery area, they will pretty much deliver wherever..Their walk-up slice window is open till 4 am. Which was a favorite of mine after coming home from work (I work at a bar), and grabbing a slice. It is great for coming home drunk as hell and grabbing a couple of slices, or a pie. I love this pizza so much I even dropped it face-down on the street and still ate it. They also have a carry-out time call special..from 5-8..call at 5. get a large one topping for five dollars...call at 6:19...pay 6.19..you get it..I miss living a block away, but I'm sure my cardiovascular system loves it.
So their salads are really awesome. &#160;Didn't really like the 7 kinds of beef dish. &#160;I love the atmosphere and service in this place! &#160;So romantic and dark &amp; cool. &#160;Plus there's a one-of-a-kind outdoor seating with it's own unique waterfall. &#160;I like the Tamarindtini martini best of all. &#160;You cannot go there and not have one. &#160;They are to die for. &#160;Otherwise I think their portions are small for the price. &#160;I don't eat here much for that reason. &#160;I come for the Tamarindtinis! &#160;:) &#160;If you can't find parking in the lot, go back out to Jackson, and head East, then take a left on 12th Ave S, then another left on S. Main - there is usually parking there. Except for the parking (which is not something that they can do very much about) this fusion Vietnamese restaurant is about as good as it gets. Be prepared for long waits if you don't make a reservation. That's how popular this place is.Outdoor seating when the weather is warm is highly recommended. The patio environment is really nice with the running water and space heaters.As part of their 5th Anniversary celebrations, there are 5 items for 5 dollars each, and this is fabulous value for money. Some of my favourite items are the stuffed squid appetizer and the 7-course beef (almost enough to feed my family of four with two young kids). I'm eating my lunch leftovers from dinner right now. &#160;Not as good as having them fresh, and considering that I don't own a microwave, not as good cold, but they'll do. &#160;I love eating here. &#160;Unfortunately, I can't not eat here without getting everything from appetizer to dessert... and a drink. &#160;That being said, and me being poor, I only come here when my father is in town and paying, such as today.Here is what I order regularly: Tamarind Tree rolls for starters- I love the crunchy wonton paper in the middle, followed by the chili lemon grass tofu, followed by the bananas and congac and usually with a cocktail or the Thai iced tea. &#160;And this is why I leave with a second meal in to-go bags (yes, bags, plural), and only eat here when I'm not paying. &#160;Bonus, the patio seating in the warmer months. I am very impressed with d&#233;cor. &#160;Many places in the ID seem to not care and I appreciate that. &#160;During a nice summer afternoon, the outside patio would be a perfect place to enjoy a meal or a drink from their nice bar. &#160;A few imperfections but overall nice.The food was good; I was satisfied with what I had. Unless it's pho or a ba Minh sandwich I don't have much experience with this style. &#160;Was fresh, and waitress was very nice and helpful. Met here on a business lunch. Was excited cause I heard some good things and I have to say this place was indeed good. Definitely not your average Vietnamese place. It's more upscale and modern....some nice touches. Beware parking can be tough so arrive before the rush. Meter maid also chalks cars in the actual parking lot FYI. They are currently having a special anniversary menu which includes meals for $5. I decided to try the beef short ribs and also ordered some fresh spring rolls. &#160;So the food was really good... Very nice presentation, plates, tea kettle etc. - Nicer than other places. Although you can definitely go to other Vietnamese places in the area and get as good or better food. This place is just nicer and great if you're looking for something more upscale and/or meeting up for business. On a different note, they have decent ventilation here so I didn't walk out with the smell of pho stuck in my hair and clothes - and I liked that. I've heard SO much about this restaurant from SO many people, so I was happy to finally be down in the international district, to give this place a try. It's difficult to find, and is in a ghetto looking area. But the food was delicious, more flavorful than other vietnamese restaurants. The pork was grilled perfectly. It costs more than most Vietnamese restaurants, but is nicer in decor (I'd say an average of ~$10/dish, vs. the usual ~$7/dish at other places). For all the hype though, I was disappointed in a number of things. The restaurant had a strange smell to it, our table wasn't clean (when we showed up, the guy seating us picked up a few pieces of something, maybe food? left on the table), then sat us, and then gave us tea without any tea cups. We had to ask for the tea cups later. My plate was chipped in two separate areas and had some gross stain on it. So for the extra price, it didn't seem all that much nicer. This place was so hard to find. Even with Google Maps on our phones, it took us a while to realize that it was all the way in the back corner of some random plaza.When we got here, this place was much fancier than I had expected. We walked in and the hostess was white. That is just unheard of to me because I'm used to Vietnamese restaurants that don't even have a hostess at all. I just had a simple lemongrass beef vermicelli dish. I was thinking, can't really be much different from the vermicelli I've tried elsewhere, but the beef was just really well-cooked. My friend had the chili pepper lemongrass tofu which was also pretty delicious. I wish I remembered what my other friend had. It was some dish with 9 different small bowls but I thought that was just an amazing dish. Overall, the ambience and service were definitely up there, particularly for a Vietnamese restaurant. And despite the posh atmosphere, the food still tasted deliciously authentic. DELICIOUS!!!Lovely decor (servingware too!). Attentive, helpful, and charming servers - definitely ask them for suggestions if you're feeling overwhelmed.The food was abundant, fresh, and tasty. &#160;My favorite was the steamed baguette - it came with a heap of various fresh herbs (some mint, asian basil.. some other things I couldn't identify) and plenty of toppings. &#160;The pho was alright, but I'd definitely try something more interesting. Dessert was delicious too! Got the grilled banana cake. The banana was fragrant and sweet, wrapped in chewy grilled sweet rice and the whole thing is swimming in coconut milk. Yumm...Also a $5 lunch special is going on to commemorate their 5th anniversary. You won't find a better deal in Chinatown. It is a little hard to find. If you're facing asian plaza, it's on the left around back. &#160;At night, I was really scared waiting for a bus and ended up hailing the first cab I saw - some scary people approached us.Food was pretty amazing. &#160;Fried rolls are the best I've had. &#160;Skip the salad type rolls because they're not a standout here. &#160;Also the best bun I've had anywhere. &#160;And the crepe - I loved the crepe! &#160;It's amazing. &#160;Very strong coconut milk flavor and delicious fillings. &#160;My companion raved about the beef pho, but that's not really my thing.The back patio is nice.If you go at night on the weekend, be sure to call for a cab well in advance so you don't end up trapped on a seedy street corner like we did! Tamarind Tree is a very lovely restaurant located in a really dark corner of a seedy parking lot that smells like rotten food. As soon as you step into the restaurant, how nasty the parking lot was (and some crazy drivers fighting over a parking spot) would be a distant memory...I looooooooooooooooooove their salad rolls. They are fresh, crunchy, crispy, and refreshingly delicious goodness all tightly wrapped up in &#160;translucent and chewy rice paper and ready to be dipped in fish sauce. I could just eat rolls and rolls and rolls and rolls of them all by myself.I've tried their bun bo hue (OK), duck noodles (not too bad), regular pho (very mediocre), catfish noodle soup (the soup is quite tasty), and grilled eggplant dish (my personal favourite!).I won't say Tamarind Tree is authentic or serves the best Vietnamese food. However, I can say that they do offer good food and good service without costing an arm and a leg. It is a good date spot too! What a little gem hidden in the corner of the International District! I've had friends rave about this place for years, but had never been until a recent Saturday night and just loved it. How could I not have been there sooner. The place was packed and the ambiance was so much more than I expected. Their menu is huge and diverse, the staff is friendly, and the food is wonderful. We had their spring rolls, which were delicious and fresh, I had the pork bun noodles and my husband had the chili beef lemongrass over rice. Can't wait to go back! Haute Viet food?Can't be true, but it is. The dishes was very well prepared. Flavor complexity is different than traditional viet rice plates, but nevertheless it was incredible It's not that the food was bad, but perhaps my expectations were too high.I came here hearing good things. It actually was my friend's last week here in Seattle, and he saw good reviews on Yelp so we decided to try this place. Being as crowded as it was, I'm sure that it must be pretty good, that many people can't be wrong (right?). Anyways we sat and unfortunately, my knowledge of Vietnamese cuisine was rather limited, so we opted for the easy way out and got the 7 course beef thing.It wasn't bad, but I wasn't blown away. Maybe it was because the chef was overextended, or something. Each item was good, but nothing really stood out. Furthermore, since it seemed like some of it was more traditional Vietnamese fare, we had no idea how to go about actually eating it, and I'm pretty sure we did it wrong. I know, it's food, how can you get it wrong? You just put it in your mouth. Still, it was confusing, and hectic, with seven courses coming out onto our too-small table.Overall it was good. I liked the ambiance, and I had a good time with my friend. However, I would've liked to enjoy the food more too. 5 Years Anniversary, 5 different entrees, only for $5.Great, I never notice about this restaurant due to their location. I don't think that area will have "looking clean" modern Vietnamese food. The food is great, and they have outdoor seating (I won't recommend). &#160;Don't expect good service when it is peak hour as well. I would give their food for 5 stars, but then everything else combined, I can only give 3 stars.I dont think you can get disappoint with their food, I havent try their drinks yet, but I will revisit again for their fantastic food. The location is bad, for the surroundings, I don't really expect their kitchen to be clean anyways. As everyone know, location is very important and even your kitchen is clean, but if the one next is not, it is probably a disaster for your restaurant. My friends, boyfriend and I come here for lunch during the week all the time.You can't beat those constantly-changing $5 dishes! (Weekday lunches only.)A favorite amongst my meat-eating friends is the broken rice with the pork and egg or shrimp cake. &#160;I always love the vegetarian crepe. &#160;The eggs wrapped around the bean sprouts, carrots, daikon with the lettuce and fresh herbs is delish!I also enjoy the salads, soup noodles and creme brulee. Pass on the rice cakes.Environment-wise, I love mom and pop store pho, but I also definetely appreciate these nicer Vietnamese restaurants (such as this Long Provincial which I still want to try and Green Tree). I've been here for birthday parties and I like sitting out on the deck when its nice out.I vote, go go go...might run into you there during lunch hour! :) This is actually a 5 star restaurant, but I knocked off a star because of the parking and location can be difficult. &#160;This secluded oasis is tucked behind a busy little strip mall and get's packed when 12:00 lunch crowd comes, so try and get there early to get a table or go online to reserve(highly recommended). &#160;I won't repeat what other yelpers have written in regards to the variety of delicious Vietnamese dishes they serve , but what is impressive is how cheap the prices are! &#160;They even have $5 lunch specials that are a great deal and will leave you full and satisfied.Also try their desserts especially the fresh coconut chilled jelly that is served inside a young coconut! &#160;Very refreshing after a meal and it helps clean the pallate after eating all those spicey/salty food.Just this past week alone I visited (and ate) Tamarind Tree 3 times! All You Need Is Love, No...All You Need is a Bowl of Beef Stew Noodles from Tamarind Tree!I have never been disappointed when I come here to Tamarind Tree, so I have a lot of love for this place especially on Friday or Saturday because Conrad is working on those days.First time, Conrad ( waiter) serving us was last year recommending the seven courses of beef which was an abundant of delicious food. He was very attentive to my guests needs and quick to refill our glasses each time. He remember me from last year and always hooking us up.Last weekend, Conrad did it again delivering outstanding customer service on my date night with my wife and recommended the Beef Stew Noodles and hot banh mi baguette roll on the side to dip it in the stew.He sat us near the stone fireplace and trendy painting away from the crowded room. He got me a Kumquat Martini and put it in a tall manly glass but super stiff....I was buzzing off that drink. He started us off with the Tamarind Tree Fresh Rolls with peanut sauce, so delish with a crispy crunch in the middle. My wife had her veggie pho which she enjoyed very much.The Beef Stew Noodles had egg noodle with big chunks of carrots, tender beef brisket and beef tendon for flavor...add in the fresh bean sprouts &amp; fresh basil, you got heaven in a bowl. The hot baguette roll was just what I needed to soak all the tasty spicy broth in the bowl. Also, a separate dipping sauce for the beef, which is outstanding!The decor is modern not typical for a Vietnamese Restaurant, bathroom is modern &amp; clean. The prices are affordable, food is excellent and Conrad is the best! &#160;He sticks out from everybody because he doesn't look Vietnamese and handsome for the ladies, he is Chinese, Filipino and German.If you want great tasting vietnamese cuisine without breaking your wallet and a romantic date night spot...Come here because you can feel the LOVE in their FOOD! This restaurant is by far my favorite place to eat in Seattle.Get the Green Papaya Salad.Service is awesome and during the week there are 5 items for 5 dollars on a separate menu. a great value.also the bathrooms are so cool. I'm Vietnamese and travel to Vietnam frequently so I must say, I know Vietnamese food. For a "higher end" Vietnamese restaurant, this place isn't bad. &#160;Usually Vietnamese restaurants that have nice decor and ambiance don't fare too well in the quality of food. However, Tamarind Tree offers a very nice variety of authentic Vietnamese dishes that go beyond what you see in your typical Vietnamese restaurant.I recommend any of their salads, particularly the papaya or mango salad. I'm also a fan of their steamed rice rolls stuffed with minced pork. I would however, stay away from ordering the stuffed squid. It was too salty and fishy tasting for me. Also, their fried egg rolls are on the thicker side. I generally prefer the skin to be thinner. However, the taste is good. &#160;I think this is a great place to take someone who enjoys Vietnamese food or loves trying "ethnic" cuisines. this place used to be known as A Little Bit of Saigon. I've been coming here since then! and since then they've really stepped everything up. The decor is a bit cheap looking still - but its more clean and inviting than it used to be. A very popular place nestled in the corner of a small parking lot.The food is always good. from the large array of appetizers (the tamarind shrimp skewers are amazing). you have every vietnamese dish you can possibly imagine on the menu as well. &#160;They also have a large selection of drinks to order from and all their cocktails are suprisingly delicious!One may complain of the slightly higher prices than your typically vietnamese restaurant - however you get what you pay for in life. the food is of better quality - the facility is cleaner and the staff is more professional. i've always found it baffling that someone would call a large bowl of pho or a huge serving of food for $9.50 expensive (compared to $7.50 at a smaller restaurant) and yet not blink twice when charged $12 for a shot of patron at the bar/club. they missed one star due to the lack of follow up after the meals are delivered. i had to ask for more napkins, waive someone down for more water, and ask for the check. and it may be just me - but its seems pretty evident that white folks have a better experience than asians do at this restaurant. my theory - is that white folks will typically tip 15 - 20% on their checks - while a majority of asians will do a few bucks no matter the dollar amount. although i hope i'm wrong in this assumption - i wouldn't be overly suprised if that is truely is the case. nonetheless - good food and i will be back!pros: good food, great cocktailscons: gets very very busy on lunch and dinner hours, lack of parking/very tight stalls, service is a bit on the slow side Really delicious, fresh-tasting food!The beef skewers are amazing, as was the lemongrass beef noodle bowl. &#160;There was also a fantastic chicken curry. &#160;Their prices are also very reasonable, especially considering portion size. &#160;I have not yet found anything you can go wrong with on the menu.One dessert really stood out to me - the ginger mousse. &#160;My god - it was spicy, and creamy, and YUM.I also commend them for making a really tasty drink - I never would have guessed it, but the Tamarind Fizz is great! &#160;Who knew that tamarind and rum could be so amazing together?I especially recommend going here with a group of friends and ordering a bunch of dishes to share family style. &#160;That way you can try a broad spectrum of dishes and I daresay you'll be impressed by how reasonably priced it is per person at the end of the meal! Food is decent but over priced. I rather go next door for the real deal. This place however does have some amazing cocktails. They are delicious and full of flavor. I think that it is awesome that they put fresh fruit in most of them.I didn't like that they didn't have fresh jalape&#241;os, I mean how are you going to serve Pho with out it.Overall it is cool but I would only stop by here for a drink. Don't waste your time eating at all of the same-ol shitty Chinese restaurants in the international district....seriously, DON'T!I live next door and this is the best place around here. &#160;Perfect restaurant really......service-price-taste-wait time-vegetarian dishes, you name it they do it right. Best fresh cocktails around. Also love the hidden, waterfall patio hidden in the parking lot. They have a delicious vegetarian spicy tomato pineapple soup and a huge menu I still haven't fully explored. Not a fan of the crepes, too many mung beans. Nice ambience, a bit more classy than the usual vietnamese dives we visit around town.Another favorite of mine is the Green Papaya? in the ID. I've been here a bunch of times in the past, and all I can really say is that it's a more chaotic and louder version of my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Chinatown, Green Leaf.All the food is without question SOLID, you won't be disappointed by the duck noodles, any other bun, etc. I've also had the bun bo hue here and it's not up to par with Green Leaf; MUCH more mild and just not as flavorful. That being said, you'll generally be happy with all the food at Tamarind Tree, it's all authentic.Server crowd is much more diverse (in terms of ethnicity). They treat you very well so no problems with this one!Parking is a drag, and it's in incredibly sketchy area, that being said, Tamarind Tree is very well set up and probably the nicest building in the area.With all being said, this is definitely a fun place to grab a few drinks and eat some solid food, but GO TO GREEN LEAF. Everything tastes better, and it's a lot more relaxed atmosphere! I've come here numerous times. It's one of those places I go for dinner when I want a "nice" sit down dinner that's also casual. It's casual, but the interior is set up so that it feels a bit more special than normal. My usual is the Hai nam chicken pot. Gingery, chicken on top of rice which comes with fish sauce on the side. Pour the fish sauce over and its delicious! Although...they're not always consistent with the hai nam pot, the last time I had it, it wasn't as flavorful as it was before, but I still will order it bc all the other times, its been fantastic! I've also tried other dishes including the vodka chicken, catfish, spicy beef, combo bowl, lotus root salad, and of course, the fresh spring rolls (get these!).All tasty! Only downside is sometimes certain dishes may be a bit salty for my tastes, but that's what the rice is for!Food is good, ambiance is nice, and the martini's are always doubles! We always get the lychee martinis! Stong, sweet, and comes with 2 lychee!It can get quite busy @ times, but they do take reservations. Service is always pleasant. Price wise, it's about $10 or more for dish, a bit higher than what you would expect for a Vietnamese restuarant, but they cater to a more American crowd and the ambiance is pretty. On another note, if you go late, sometimes they run out of certain dishes (last time was a pork dish), so try and go earlier if you can. I love the atmosphere, it's a little hidden in the market, but once you find it you come back to it. &#160;Sitting by the fireplace is one of my favorite spots. &#160;Food is delicious!!! i had spring rolls this last time. &#160;they come cut in half. &#160;so you get 4 pieces to share at the table. &#160;I've had the big beef dish and it's excellent. &#160;i've also had the pho tai and the pork fried roll with the barbeque pork bun and it's excellent also. &#160;really nice bathroom. &#160;i can't believe i have never reviewed it until now since i've been there so much.went with a bunch of dudes. &#160;5 of us to be exact. &#160;on a saturday night. &#160;whatever.and it totally wasn't what i had here that caused it, but a couple of hours later i found my head and shoulder pushed against a chain link fence in the rain barfing my brains out. &#160;i could see all the little noodle bits from the spring rolls. rocketing out of my mouth onto the poor pavement. &#160;GOOD TIMES!! I come here a few times a year for the tamarind tree rolls and lemongrass tofu. When I venture away from those two things, I am rarely satisfied with the food. But I know what works, I can't get it quite right anywhere else, and I will continue to keep coming back here. Love this little hidden gem! The broth is essential to good Vietnamese soups, and they do a great job! Ingredients are fresh and portions are large. The ambiance is surprisingly nicer than most other Vietnamese restaurants and there's a large variety of authentic dishes! I mean this is one of my favorite places in all Seattle. It's amazing. My friends and I go here all the time. My boyfriend and I go here all the time. I LOVE it. our favorites include: the mango salad, the lemongrass beef noodle bowl (AMAZING), and the spring rolls with prawns. wash it down with a beer. Fantastic. their sister restaurant, Long Provincial on 2nd and Stewart is perfect if you are downtown. GO here. you won't be disappointed. (but stay away from the crepe, it's a bit greasy). Poor location, but great ambiance and interior. &#160;It's like a posh Vietnamese restaurant and CLEAN in the ID! Crazy, right? &#160;It's almost always packed but the food is great and the service is good. This place is a classy Veitnemese place. I love taking people here for lunch, it is inexpensive and delicious. A Seattle gem I've been wanting to try for years and I finally got the chance to! We started off with the spring rolls, which were very tasty and fresh. It had things in it that I was not familiar with, and I can't remember what they were but it was good nonetheless. I decided to try something different that I'd never had before and ordered the Vietnamese crepe. I figured since I've had bun many times, I should try something new. It reminded me of okonomiyaki or those Korean savory pancakes, but stuffed with a bunch of bean sprouts and fresh herbs and lettuce. It came with a side of fish sauce (gawd I love that sauce). It was really delicious! Next time I'd like to try their bun or their SEVEN COURSE BEEF MEAL. I love this place :) &#160;It's such a gem! &#160;I took my boyfriend here after much persuading the other night. &#160;His experiences with Vietnamese food had mainly been pho, bahn mi sandwiches, and an occasional noodle or salad dish. &#160;He enjoys those, but doesn't exactly crave or want to go out for Vietnamese food when I suggest it. &#160;After going here that all changed! &#160;It's located in the far corner of this horrible looking tiny strip mall. &#160;When we got there he was like "Where are we??!" The restaurant was hidden by a huge truck. &#160;But once we got near the sweet look of it, the beautiful out door dining area, and fountain really made it shine. &#160;We stuffed ourselves silly! &#160;We had Tamarind Tree Rolls, Lemongrass Beef Satay, Quail grilled in Tamarind, Lemongrass Shrimp Paste Fried Rice, and Garlic Green Beans. &#160;The fried rice and quail were my favorites, but I would gladly eat anything they gave me! &#160;I do find their menu confusing because it doesn't tell you what your dish comes with. &#160;You could order some chicken and when it comes out there is rice paper, noodles, and huge mounds of veggies on the side. &#160;That's my only complaint, but its not an important one.  &#160; I'll always love Tamarind Tree! do NOT be dissuaded by what you see on the outside at first glance! &#160;if you judge this restaurant by its cover, you will definitely miss out!yes, that big box-like thing &#160;on the left when you drive into the parking lot from jackson street looks like a dumpster. &#160;and yes, the neighboring businesses give you the impression that this is another eatery in the vietnamese section of the international district. &#160;but don't be fooled. &#160;find your parking spot, walk through the front door, and allow yourself to be impressed.the food was excellent. &#160;i actually just got back from dinner there. &#160;we had the chicken satay, egg rolls, chicken curry, and beef stew. &#160;all of them were quite tasty. &#160;i can't say how authentic they are as vietnamese dishes, since i'm not vietnamese and i've never been to vietnam. &#160;but the food is far above whatever other vietnamese places i've gone to in seattle. &#160;it makes me think that perhaps the chef had experience from other fine-dining establishments, and had decided to open his/her own place.the service was excellent as well. &#160;the hostess was efficient and welcoming. &#160;our waiter was very attentive and helpful with the menu.the ambience was remarkable. &#160;absolutely NOT the sticky, icky kind of place you might expect to see in chinatown. &#160;whoever did the interior design knew what they were doing. &#160;and whoever did the patio design had very good ideas too. &#160;and the restroom design was interesting as well.my only suggestion for improvement would be to put some blinds on the front doors, as the summer evening sun is quite bright to the eyes for people facing it.overall i highly recommended checking out tamarind tree! Don't be afraid when you first pull up to this restaurant: yes, it's in the back of a strip mall parking lot on the corner of urine and crime spree, but it really is, as other reviewers have noted, a hidden gem. Sure, the menu pages stick together, but that's only a testament to the yummy sauces to come. I visited last night and got a wide selection of small plates: lemongrass beef satay with sugarcane, beef short ribs, chicken satay with mango salad, and meatballs. All of the flavors were spot on and the food was not hypersalty, as you might expect. Service is moderately paced, but friendly. Portion sizes are ample and the price point is spot on. I am happy my friend took me here; it's a place that might otherwise be easily overlooked. Bomb, bomb, bomb. It's hidden away in this corner of a plaza. You would never think such a wonderful restaurant could be back there. Modern design, great drinks (try the pineapple mojito or the lychee martini), and the food is to die for!!!! &#160;You can make reservations online. The tables are not very big so try to keep you group as small as possible. As others have noted, this place is a little hard to find, and the location can be a little sketchy, but it's definitely worth the effort. Dozens of exotic fruity cocktails (with tamarind and lime, my favorites), and a huge variety of food (it takes 15 minutes just to read the menu). Everything I've had has been delicious, and I love that most courses are served with a heaping pile of fresh herbs and veggies. The sauces are divine, service is fine. Nice outdoor seating area (with a fountain and screen to hide the noise and sights of the parking lot). This is one of my standbys. Fantastic! Bit pricey, but wonderful, large menu. Everything I've had is great. One of my favs in Seattle. Great for summertime with the great outside seating. Fast service (although the waiter replaced the table cover while we were still sitting at the table waiting for our check). I had the vermacelli bowl and it was delicious. Meat tasted great. One con to this restaurant is that the noise level was a little too loud. We ate there 9PM on a Wed night and the whole restaurant was full (good sign). Food is excellent which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Love the stuffed squid, green papaya salad, lemon chicken, bun... Appetite stirring up!HOWEVER, the service is chronically slow and inattentive. We've been patroning the Tamarind Tree for several years now and hope these guys listen to the feedback. 2 stars for the service. Oh, and the location is a bit seedy in the International District (i.e. Chinatown). My girlfriends and I were recently chased by a homeless guy who actually went up to someone and physically hit them. We were running in our high heels for high heaven. Once you're in the place, it is an oasis with hip decor. Patio seating is where you want to be if you can snag one. Be warned solo fellow women. (Long Provincial, the sister restaurant in downtown, is okay -- they can't replicate very well the same dishes at Tamarind Tree) Really, really good Vietnamese cuisine. I took my friend here for lunch when she was visiting from Austin. It was really busy but we were still served in a very timely manner and our food was so fresh. We had the spring rolls to start and I wish I would have tried one of their cocktails because they looked unique. I had the tofu lemongrass noodles. Whatever the tofu was marinated in is a winning combination because I've never had such delicious and flavorful tofu before. My friend had one of the soups with tomatoes and she also really enjoyed it. We topped off our lunch with the grilled cassava with coconut milk and peanuts. I really wanted to try the flan but didn't have room. Next time! Delicious Vietnamese food here! &#160;Usually busy, but worth the wait! &#160;Their spring rolls are delicious! It's a must have. Tamarind Tree is the best pho in Seattle by far. &#160;I have been here about a million times and always order the same thing. &#160;Tamarind Tree Rolls, which are so fresh and delicious and the Pho Tai. &#160;I have tried a couple of their appetizers and they are all good. &#160;I really want to try their 7 courses of beef but can never deviate from my usual order. &#160;The parking sitch is a little spotty and sometimes the service can be too but I don't even care it is always SO good. Yum. Everything was great. I tried "Long" first and then the "Tamarind Tree" a few days later. Both experiences were great. The Spring Rolls are a must for me. Try them with BBQ pork. They have that extra bite of flavor. I can't wait to get back to Seattle to eat them again. The atmosphere was very nice too. A great place to meet a friend or small group of friends for a meal that will impress. I thought I liked Vietnamese food. I like pho from Than Bros, Banh Mi from Saigon Deli or Yeh-yeh's, and spring rolls are usually tasty, if a little heavy on vermicelli. But after a dinner at Tamarind Tree, I think I might love Vietnamese food.  The restaurant was hopping on the thursday night we went, but we made reservations and were given our table quickly, and service, while slow to start, was quick to bring drinks, apps, and then entrees. We started with the fried eggrolls, the grilled pork meatball spring rolls, and the stuffed escargot. The eggrolls were really interesting - delicately battered in a light tempura-ish coating, and a great flavored pork adn veggie filling. The stuffed escargot seems like a misnomer - they are more accurately escargot pork meatballs on lemongrass skewers. We all agreed they were made by the delicious sweet ginger sauce that ccompanied them. Without it, they were a little bland and chewy, but that sauce was so good, my stepmother drained every drop from her plate. The spring rolls were for me a revelation of the possible delights of spring rolls - refreshing, flavorful, and enhanced by a crisp flaky core of deep-fried eggroll skin. We shared three entrees - coconut curry prawns, curry chicken, and the tamarind tree crepe. The two curry dishes were similar in their rich, slightly spicy broth. The prawns were massive and tender, with the pleasant crispness to their flesh that a well cooked prawn has. The chicken was fall-apart tender and flavorful to the bone. Nom nom nom. The crepe was not at all what we expected- instead of a delicate french style crepe, we were served what looked rather like a deep-fried omelette, with a massive plate of mints, cilantro and lettuce. Our server explained that we should cut the crepe apart, put pieces into lettuc, rolled up with herbs, and sauce it with the herbed fish sauce. On cutting through the crispy crepe shell, we found the inside bursting with more tender prawns, lots of crispy beansprouts, and FLAVOR. &#160;They were enjoyed by all, even my father who usually feigns an allergy to all things green. All in all, we left delighted, impressed by price, decor, selection and flavor, and already anticipating a return trip. Yum! This was an education in excellent Vietnamese food. We enjoyed the fresh rolls, but it was the halibut with mushrooms that really blew my mind. The service was dismissive and slow... but I'd still go back any day to try more of the very long menu. best deal for $5 lunch ...they have weekly specials for lunch and I've been several times and have tried lots of different things. &#160;Great service, and great food. Last night was my second visit. As the sign says, it's provincial Vietnamese food. I like this place because it has a huge menu with dishes for every taste. Whether you want a standard pho, a hearty beef dish or an unusual seafood dish, this place delivers. The flavors are bold, and the smells are very fragrant. The duck noodle soup dish was flavorful, and not overly salty. The spring rolls are well made, and have fried tofu skins to give it a nice textural crunch. The stuffed squid (pictured below), had a nice, balanced pork and mushroom filling inside. The squid was really tender. All and all good food.Why the low ranking? If the score were based on the food alone, it would rate between 4 and 5. The downfall is the service. On my first visit, I was more or less getting hit on by a male waiter, despite the fact that I was sitting next to one of my female friends. On my second visit, we couldn't get the waiter to spend more than 10 seconds at our table. He Never checked on how we were doing. We were consistently ignored, and what made things worse was that the table next to us got what I consider very good service. We ordered an extra appetizer, which took forever to come out. To end things, he came to take my credit card and informed me they didn't take American Express. As I was getting another card, he runs off, and doesn't come back for another 5 minutes. Bad service is more common at an Asian places in general, but Vietnamese places are somewhat the exception to this stereotype. It's just a shame that the service can't complement the food. Atmosphere was pleasant and suprising for the location. The Spring rolls were outstanding. they had an element of crunch that I had not had in other Spring rolls, very nice. However, that is where the accolades stop. Our entrees may have been good but they tasted as though they were cooked hours before and rewarmed. we shared the Tamarind Tree Rice. All the meats were dry and luke warm. The shrimp was dry and had the consistency of playdough. The flavors seemed as though they would have been good if served fresh and at the right temp. I won't go out of my way to return here. So if you're white, like asian food, and have money, you will love this place! However if you're someone who likes to save money I think you're better off going to the vietnamese house next door. The prices here are over the top for the food you're ordering. Quality of cooking is great, but I wouldn't recommend ordering these pho. If you have the extra money and looking for a great environment where you're surrounded by leaves and bamboo at your table, this is the place for you. If not, save some money and eat somewhere else for food just as good Having just returned from Vietnam, was surprised how amazing this restaurant was. &#160;The rare beer and tripe Pho is amazing. &#160;Also, the seven meat dish is pretty impressive. This restaurant has always been my family's favorite. The food is amazing, the servers are attentive but don't hover, and it's surprisingly inexpensive for the atmosphere. The pho is not the best, but the rest of the menu more than makes up for it. The interior and general aesthetic is very well thought-out, and the restaurant keeps a persistent hum without getting too loud. They have outdoor seating with a fireplace, if I recall correctly. At times the restaurant can get really busy and unfortunately I've experienced some long wait times. But I think you can get reservations so that usually alleviates the issue. I usually get lemongrass tofu skewers as the appetizer and cold noodles for my entree. And don't be afraid to ask for extra fish sauce! The stuff is amazing. The one big downside to Tamarind Tree is that parking is a nightmare...it shares a not-that-big parking lot with several other businesses and restaurants in the neighborhood, so parking can be crazy hard to find if you get their at the wrong time. This is an excellent place to get your fix of North and Central Vietnamese Cuisine. As a vegetarian your dining experience will be more then deliciously delightful. I am a huge fan of the winter melon soup. I also love the light tofu dishes. There is a wide variety of dishes and a dinner course that you can mix and match to your liking. This is a quaint and cozy establishment. Great for dates. The only issue would be getting there. Like so many establishments in Little Saigon and China Town, you will need the skills of a Ninja to navigate to the the restaurant that is tucked away behind a few less then tidy grocer shops, restaurants etc.. Good luck finding a place to park! =) Also, I would suggest making a reservation during peak hours. It can get to be a bit of a wait and there isn't much of a waiting area. I forgot to mention, the drinks are pretty stiff but tasty. I had a cucumber martini. It was delicious. A very nice compliment to my meal, which was an array of family style dishes.. Unique recipes and terrific service! &#160;I do recommend this place. &#160;But for the price they need to be more attentive to their quality control. &#160;My prawns in coconut milk was delicious - but the prawns were overcooked and tough. &#160;My wife had a catfish dish. &#160;The first few bites were startlingly yummy - but then the salt caught up with us....yikes!! &#160;If I have to pay $1.50 for rice I expect that they'd ast least serve jasmine. &#160;The ginger mousse was exceptional. &#160;Finding the restaurant is an adventure itself - and parking is a challenge. This is probably my favorite restaurant in all of Seattle. &#160;It's not like anyplace else. &#160;If you can get past the shady parking lot entrance, the inside is beautiful. &#160;Service is always fast and friendly and the prices are reasonable. &#160;And the food! &#160;It is soooo good! &#160;Consistently fresh and flavorful. &#160;It's like someone's Grandma is in the kitchen making each dish and then presenting it in an an almost gourmet style. &#160;I wish I could eat here every day. &#160;Great for vegetarians too! Imperial crispy rice was absolutely amazing with the pork . . . could've eaten the entire thing myself! This is the kinda place your excited to go back to again to try more dishes, really liked the green mango salad, lemon grass chicken and stuffed noodle dish with pickled bean sprouts.
Love them. The food is consistently good, price point is spot-on, and (delivery) service is amazing. The only teeny tiny little negative, though not a full-star-negative, is the restaurant itself. On one occassion, I went into the restaurant for take-out. It was fast, and the same good quality as usual, but the inside of this place is a little sketchy. Great choice! So far this place is great. They don't substitute grease and sodium over flavor and I love that the food is consistent. I am a huge fan of Chinese food, and feel that even Americanized Chinese food could be better in many places. I've been discouraged eating Chinese here in Seattle, but this place constantly delivers. I've been hard-pressed to find better Chinese in Seattle... especially near my neighborhood.
Dear Griffin Z.,My co-workers and I frequently read your post regarding Benihana and their sushi lunch buffet. After you gave it such high remarks we knew we had to try it!This really is a great sushi buffet, for an all you can eat sushi experience you can't beat. Benihana is full of win and you will be too. I left pleasantly plumper than I was when I walked in.By the way, I took your 38 piece challenge and upped it 3, first time in I was able to finish off 41 pieces of the delicious sushi (57 is current high). What an amazing lunchtime value. $16.00 for all the sushi you can eat. I was loading up my plate and the chef asked if I wanted some eel. I said yes. He made them fresh and put 3 on my plate. Eat here now. One of my favorite meals in Seattle. Fresh. Delectable. Unique. Ingredients. Benihana. When you walk in you feel welcome already. The service is.......FANTASTIC! With the oven right in front of you, how can you go wrong? They even end your visit with an onion volcano, now what other restaurant does that? Exactly, you can't think of one, can you?! You feel like you are in the kitchen and you never have one of those waiters that completely ignores you. The portion size is in a large quantity so, you can take the goodness home. The price is the only thing that is a downer.....its kinda expensive, but my parents take me so I don't get stuck with the bill. &#160;Its great for a family birthday party, sports party, really anything. Its great also for a christmas party for the family or even a family reunion ! When my family and I went there, I had the Hibachi Shrimp. It comes with the service you want, the taste you need, and the presentation that you can't find at any other restaurant in Seattle or even in the United States! I love this restaurant and I wouldn't change one thing in their, service, taste, presentation, etc. Fresh. Delectable. Unique. Ingredients. Benihana. --Sarah M. Thought I'd poke in here for lunch a bit earlier than I planned. For a sushi buffet, it's rather satisfying, good, and even felt fresh to me. Some of the tuna cuts looked weird to me, but everything else looked appetizingly enough. I don't think places create buffets with profit in mind, because they attractive so many people who seek to compete with themselves as to how much one can stuff themselves. I'm guessing exposure for everything else? I do not know. The sushi is presented nicely by the sushi bar and the chefs behind ask if you'd like anything special (i noticed a gentleman across from me get trayfulls of special ordered nigiri). The waitress (Kyong?) was pleasant and smiled. Refilled my iced tea when I was about done. Just overall nice. The walls are covered with celeb photos (From what appears to be a recent Angelina shot to an old school Van Damme shot back when he donned a mullet). Must be from multiple locations. Clean, modern, simple bathroom. I'd go back. One issue may be it doesn't appear to be wheelchair accessible (just stairs?). Although, that should be no problem if 2-4 arms can help out. the other day, we came here to eat and we all enjoyed our time at this place. &#160;The chef was very entertaining and made a volcano of onions for us that steamed!! He's really good at what he does. &#160;He popped those inedible shrimp tails right into his chef hat - I'm sure he cleaned it out later. &#160;His precision tossing skills got the main meal onto our plates with lots of ooing and aahing from the customers.The food was yummy too =)BTW: The entire month of October 2010... Hibachi Shrimp &amp; Chicken for Two people served with onion soup, salad, hot green tea and ice cream... all for just $35!!! First of all, u need to decide which side of restaurant that u gonna eat. One side is sushi table. U basically eat sushi , just like &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; A regular sushi bar. The another side is where I ate, barbecue. tables with iron flat on top. And one chief will stand right in front of u and cook for u. Really good food and watchable show from chief. But too many stupid questions. Kinda expensive if u order 2 entrees for 2 person. But 1 entree per person will definitely feed u up. Food is good for the amount you get anyway. Don't come hungry, and don't come expecting a spectacular show. The cooks are nice and even some-what entertaining. However, the wait staff could use a class or two in customer service, maybe even common courtesy. If you are on a first date, I would skip this because of the cabaret seating and the unbelievable background noise. My co-workers and I frequently go to Benihana for the sushi buffet during lunch, so this review is only for the sushi buffet. &#160;I have yet to find a better sushi deal anywhere downtown. All you can eat sushi for around 15 dollars. For a person who like myself who stuff my face with 25+ pieces of sushi on every visit, it a really good deal. The selection and quality of the sushi is pretty good. Of all the times I been there, the consistent selections of sushi include ones made with tempura (fried shrimp), salmon, fish eggs, and eel. &#160;The buffet also includes around 5-7 kinds of sashimi, pieces of seafood raw/cooked on rice. My favorites are the raw salmon and eel. &#160;Salad and fruits are also avaliable. &#160;I just wish they have other salad dressing except that bitter ginger asian dressing. &#160;Miso soup is free also if you ask for it.Overall, one of the better sushi places downtown. My current record is 38 pieces. Beat that... haha "Bring me a fruity drink with an umbrella in it!" Yes those were the first words out of my mouth when I walked into the Benihana bar waiting for me party to join me.I'm not sure what it is about benihana but you are pretty obligated to get a drink with an umbrella in it... if you don't your being sacreligious or something. Anyways, I met up with my family there to celebrate a belated father's day and my dad's birthday all in one. We waited at the bar until the youngin in the group arrived and then at a table. We sipped on our super sweet mai thai's and enjoyed the generall cocophony that is Benihana.Our table was a good one, we only shared with one other couple (they looked about 16 lol) and enjoyed teh show. My niece (4 years old) especially enjoyed the host who called her "princess" and the chef who was very sweet to her and kept a constant entertainment going for her and made sure to give her a little of everything to try.As usual its overpriced to no end and the food is just descent but you know what its fun and good entertainment so no real complaints. They cooked my steak perfectly at "Cold in the middle please" without complaint but i'll say my sisters medium was a bit more on the rare side then I think she expected.A great place to take kids if you can afford it and for a sappy date night for prom queens and homecoming princesses alike. I hadn't been there since my high school prom, but we thought it would be fun and its on our buy one get one free card. &#160;I wasn't expecting a center cut tenderloin that I didn't need a knife to cut it with. &#160;I've been to a lot of steak houses and haven't had a piece of steak melt in my mouth like that in a very long time. &#160;The lobster tasted great and I love their fried rice. &#160;Yeah, its a little cheesy- the chef looked like he was in his personal hell, its definitely overly priced, but what I ordered was really excellent food. &#160;My wife ordered the standard teriyaki beef and shrimp and it was okay, but mine was damn tasty. Four stars for the kid-friendly atmosphere but only three for the food. &#160;At first it seems expensive but it is actually a great deal and ideal for kids of all ages. &#160;This place is extremely popular, especially with families. &#160;Every table has children ranging from infants to junior high. &#160;We went there with our 19 month hoping that the entertainment of watching the chef perform throughout the dinner would keep her entertained and it did! &#160;Needless to say, they are very child friendly. &#160;They offer a children's menu that turns into a chef hat, mock-cocktails for little ones, and a fun show performed by a chef who stands at the center of your communal table preparing the food. &#160;This would be a great place for a child's birthday party. &#160;The meal itself was very good value and includes an appetizer, soup, salad, vegetables, main courses, tea &amp; desert all for one price. &#160;We got their Rocky special which was around $24 and their shrimp and steak combo which was around $26. &#160;They also offer a full sushi menu here. &#160;The food &#160;is good but nothing miraculous. &#160;Make sure you have a reservation though as this place gets packed. 3.5 stars.I just had a lunch here awhile ago.I invited my friend who is visiting from Europe and I decided to give him a treat at this place. I just found out that they have eat all you can sushi/sashimi &#160;for 15.95. I guess it's a good price. It comes with miso soup, green tea, salad, good sushi/sashimi, fruits etc. I hate eat all you can restaurants but I thought, due to our conversation, we forgot to eat a lot - which is good in a way.The only downside is that we were here at 1:15 PM and the buffet is until 2 PM. There are not much selection of sushi and sashimi left. Some trays are even empty. My favorite is unagi and the sushi maker is asking me how many unagi that I like so that he can make it. My friend like salmon sashimi and same thing, he was asked how many salmon sashimi he likes. Everytime we go to the counter, we were asked what we like but we are not familiar on the choices. But I kind a understand the situation. I think they don't want to make a lot and may put it into waste. But the guy who makes the sushi is very nice and the lady who bus our table is always smiling. I just wish next time, there should be still a complete selection of sushi or sashimi until 2PM. Not 1:15PM. NOTE: This is for the lunch buffetThe lunch all-you-can-eat sushi is off the hook! &#160;Its cheap ($15) for sushi plus itsall you can eat. &#160;The sushi is fresh and decent. &#160;I wouldnt say that it blows your socks off but pretty good. &#160;The section that does the all-you-can-eat is smaller but definitly worth the wait in downtown. I'm not even sure I need to write a review for Benihana because like any chain, the service and food is very consistent, and according to my friend they have your meal down to a science. You will be in and out within an hour where everything is timed to the point you get cut off from water after you finished your meal, so there's no wanting to linger around and chit-chat. The Seattle Benihana has been the best one I've frequented though. Our chef was Asian and joked not to call immigration on him which his delivery was hilarious. Even though I've seen the tiered onion volcano and the shrimp in the hat trick a zillion times, it was still funny. This place brings back good memories of being entertained while eating with family and friends. Always fun and worth the $70ish meal.Also, I read they have a killer lunch special with all you can eat sushi for $30. The quality of seafood is worth it. I see that there are many poo-poo reviews for Benihana, but I went to a birthday party here and it was super fun to me. We came with a group of 8 adults, one child and one infant, and they did an incredible job of accommodating our seating needs, sitting us towards the back where the stroller would not be a hindrance for the waitstaff and chefs. Tony was our chef, and he was a funny guy. I guess you had to get past that dry sense of humor, but he seemed to warm up to my nephew quite a bit. The food wasn't the best I've had, and granted, this is the Applebee's of Japanese teppenyaki, the steak was really tender, high quality and tasty. The colossal shrimps were huge and juicy, and was even better than the little bite of freshwater lobster that I tried. The cocktail I tried, the Bene-Tini, was a little small, and a little too bitter from the lemon garnish. The Philadelphia Roll I had was really good. I really do not like squid, but I tried some fried calamari that my friend ordered. It was tender, moist, and not rubbery or salty like other calamari I have tried. I actually liked it! And I would eat it again! The dinner ended up being not so lousy price wise, my sister got her birthday meal for free, and my other sister and mom did a special fillet mignon for two for 39 dollars. So it was actually a little less pricey than it could have been thanks to the great coupon and promotional deals. My picky brother in law liked it, so we will probably be back for a celebration in the future. Note: I get a discount here from work so I took that into account. Been here for about 10 times since I move up to Seattle. It is right downtown and park at the garage as they validate parking. &#160;Now for the Food and Service/Show.Food: I usually get the Filet Mignon. It is actually quite good and the fried rice is yummy as well. Service/Show: This really depends on who you get. I have been there where the chef are tired after a long day and they were non-energetic and not really tiring to make it a fun experience. &#160;There are others where they are much better. The show is pretty much the same, the volcano, the fliping of the egg in shell and shrimp tail into the hat and pocket.Overall, I give it a four stars becasue for the price and food it is quite worthwile. So i heard great things about Benihana`s . Went there last Sunday for a birthday dinner . It`was so fun . Gotta do it again. The chef Tony was funny . The food was awesome ... &#160;They have a bunch of pics of famouse people some are super old &amp; they look really young . It`s nice , clean , &amp; A whole alotta fun . Go if you get the chance .... I dropped in today during lunch to try out the buffet. It was decent for the most part. The sushi was set at a reasonable temperature, nothing unusually warm. I say that since the sushi was just laid out on platters along the sushi bar with varieties of nigiri and a few rolls to choose from. Miso soup is included and so are salad w/ ginger dressing, and edamame. The total came to about $16.. but the buffet didn't meet my standards in comparison to AYCE sushi restos in Richmond,B.C. It was an okay experience but for the price I would be better off eating at conveyor belt sushi. At least then I'd get more for my money. Hmmm - I have been here several times before and had the standard Benihana experience. It's fun, though you leave smelling like a grill! That is part of the experience. A little reminder of your dinner later, when you brush your hair and grilled prawn smell drifts out. Our sushi dinner on February 13th started out a little strange. We were in the bar, for the first time at this location, just sitting. Waiting, and waiting. Finally we got our menus.Then, no one came by to take our oder! We stopped someone and asked for help. She was hesitant to take our order. Not sure why, I think our zone was technically served by a different waitress. When she did take our order, she tried to memorize it, but realized she needed help. She went to get a pad and paper and came back. We had to repeat our order for her. It took a long time for the sushi to come, and when it did, it was just ok. Same with the drinks. Just ok, nothing special, no cool garnishes or fun glasses, nothing like - wow, which is kind of what you expect from Benihana. It was cafeteria style sushi. Next time, we'll stick to the full experience in the main grill area of the restaurant.
Best burgers in Seattle.I used to live here and went there regularly. Went back immediately on our trip here and it was better than I remembered. It's a superb greasy spoon burger &amp; fries. Comes out hot &amp; fresh (their meat is never frozen) and tastes perfect with a hint of the charcoal taste from being grilled.
Eh. Hard to decide on how many stars. The good: The location is great for me and has a great view of the Sculpture Park. The pizza is actually decent. It's not my favorite authentic Italian type of pizza, but it holds up and the lunch specials are pretty good. The bad: Well, on the day that I went they were out of lettuce so there was no salad, however they were still serving a greek salad that wasn't lettuce based. It did not come with all the ingredients listed on the menu nor did mine come with any salad dressing! Or maybe I look like the kind of girl who would order a salad with no dressing? I must assure you that I am not THAT girl. Anyway, when I asked for dressing whatever the waitress brought me just did not compliment the salad so it was kind of a lunchtime bummer. The ugly: Just kidding. There wasn't really anything ugly about the experience. Decent pizza and calzones, best if you order takeout. Service dine-in is terrible - the waitress does NOT listen to anything you say. We had very specific requests related to allergies that impacted our bread, salad and pizza and all were ignored or we were totally confused. We had to send everything back at least once. I've ordered takeout several times since then, and everything was ready fast and correct. Unfortunately, this location doesn't have any gluten-free pizza, though, which is disappointing because they are a great late-night option in Belltown. I'm not here to tell you this is the best pizza you will ever have. That is a useless debate that will never be settled. However, sometimes you just want a decent, hearty slice of pizza and a glass of wine to wash it down while taking in a pretty awesome view of the Olympic Sculpture Park and Elliott Bay. When that mood strikes me, Romio's Belltown is where I land. I have tried several of their specialty pizzas, calzones, and salads. My food has always been fresh, hot, and filling and I almost always leave with leftovers which are just as tasty the next day. The bartenders are chatty and I usually end up having a fun conversation with others at the bar (which is where I usually choose to dine when I come here so I cannot validate the negative waiter service reviews from other Yelpers). Best chain pizza in Seattle area. &#160;Better than Zeek's and Pagliacci. &#160;Small pizzas are incredible, plenty of cheese and toppings on a fresh medium thickness crust with a textured bottom. &#160;Calzones are also fantastic and enough for two meals. &#160;Pizza has three main ingredients: crust, sauce and cheese. &#160;Crust here is 9/10, cheese 10/10 and sauce 9/10. Romios Pizza &amp; Pasta Belltown is Italian with some Greek. But feeling for a well-made salad, I ordered the Hot-Cold Dish (Greek Feast).Tiropeta and spanakopeta was not included as written on the menu, however, they replaced it with pita. Then doubled-up on the dolmades, meatballs and yogurt sauce. So it came out to be good dinner portion that I washed down with pomegrante white tea. Also, Romios was out of Tiramisu. The bakery does not deliver on Sunday. So I took the cannoli to go. The order only comes with one. Small-sized too. Great decor and customer service. The quick version - amazing food but some service problems. We recommend it anyway.We have been there a couple times and have not had a problem with the food at all. That said we did indeed wait a considerable amount of time for our salads. There are a few good and a few bad servers... which may account for the variations in reviews. We ordered the baked fettuccini and meatballs and the pasta with artichokes and and pesto. Both were absolutely fantastic and we will definitely be back for more. We have also ordered their pizza, which is very very good... but is also quite greasy depending on the toppings. - Very quick!- Salads are nice- Baked pastas too- And meatball sub is good - Once in a while order will get mixed up The make your own pizza is a great option! &#160;I think the food is yummy! &#160;We get our food delivered. The server here last week was extremely attentive. The food here is comparable to the other Romios'. The Magnolia location has cheaper prices than this location, so I naturally prefer the Magnolia one. So the only reason I gave this place 2 stars was because the pizza is delicious!!!The service on the other hand SUCKS!I went with 2 friends and when we got there we didnt see a server/waitress anywhere so we seated ourselves. Then waited about 15 minutes to even see a waitress and get a menu. She then brought our waters with a side of attitude. I know that she was the only one there but it wasn't super busy, there were only about 3 other tables with people at them. There were several people coming in for takeout. Looked like that was the way to go. We had to take silverware from another table, along with parmesean cheese. The entire time we were there, everytime she came by, we got to experience her wonderful attitude. It was incredibly annoying and very rude. The 2 other girls I was with are servers/bartenders at a bar by my place and they were appalled also by our lousy server and her attitude. If I ever give this place my business again (which is very doubtful!), I will be getting takeout. I suggest if you are thinking of eating here that you also get takeout or explore you other, better options. I had really great pizza by the slice here, and the happy hour for slices was decent. However, they have no beers on tap, only bottled. Even though the bartender was pleasant, the bar seems like an afterthought. Stop by if you're in the area and hungry, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. I have visited this location a few times for lunch and have come away impressed. &#160;Seattle is not known for pizza, in my opinion, and being from the midwest it is hard to find a good pizza joint. &#160;The Romio's special (pizza or calzone) is very tasty and filling. &#160;The service can and has been slow at times but the quality of the food makes up for that. &#160;The meatball sub is much better than anything you will get from the Subway across the street. This place isn't good for anything but the calzones. Don't even bother with the bland pastas. The chicken masala is the worst I have ever had hands down. It lacked in sauce and flavor. Bland bland bland! They forgot my salad with my delivery order. Always out of tiramisu. I switched to chocolate truffle cake. It tasted "old" and was thrown away after 1 bite. &#160;Delivery time is an hour. The calzones are pretty good. All around, not that great. Went for some pizza here with my wife a couple weeks ago. We just moved into the area and were trying out all the places around us for what will become our regular establishments. The pizza here is good, but i've had better. I've had pizza in Italy, Brazil and other major cities in the US. We will definitely try the other pizza places in Belltown before returning here. May change my rating in the future.
I just found out about this place today, and I could hardly wait for lunch to come so I could go check it out. &#160;I work in White Center and often find myself left wanting for good food, so anything other than Asian or Mexican food is a welcomed breath of fresh air. Not only that, but I am a big fan of BBQ, so this is right up my alley. &#160;The dining area is very clean and bright... not hurt your eyes bright, but bright as in light colored and refreshing. &#160;Its comfortable and clean. &#160;Did I mention that it was clean? &#160;Spotless. &#160;In fact, so clean, there wasn't another customer in there. &#160;I came in a few minutes after lunch, expecting some sort of rush or crowd and was quite surprised to find I was the only one there. &#160;I ordered the brisket meal (which comes with a cornbread muffin and 2 sides - I chose the baked beans and fries) and a sweet tea to wash it all down with. &#160;The service was pretty quick (then again, I was the only one there... but there was 2 or 3 takeout orders that came through while I was waiting).The brisket was served sliced and I got 4 decent size pieces. &#160;I'll admit, my first reaction was "that's all?", but in their defense, I'm 6' 2" and pushing 300lbs. Either way, it wasn't a very large portion. Not only that, but it was pretty dried out.Now I know that brisket is easy to overcook, and it seems as if they don't (or at least didn't) smoke the meat fresh every day. So if what I got was rewarmed leftovers from another day, I noticed it.The cornbread was really dry and completely fell apart after I took one bite. Not only that, but I like my cornbread a little on the sweet side and this was very much on the "corn" side. Reminded me of a corn tortilla in the shape of a muffin. Okay, maybe that's not fair, but close enough.Overall, I wanted so badly to give Mike's a higher score, but really it probably only deserved a 2 when it came to value and taste. But the cleanliness and speed of service earned it an extra star.If you're in White Center and sick of Mexican of Pho and you want something other than Zippy's, then this may be worth checking out. I've been holding off on writing a review because I wanted to figure out how I really feel about this place, so here goes...When I initially heard about this place in White Center, I was very excited to have a BBQ joint close to home. After eating from here a handful of times, I've decided that the experience with the food is largely dependent upon what you order, meaning that it's either hit or miss.The restaurant itself is very cute, clean, bright, and spacious. A lot of reviews have stated that the people here are super nice, which is partially true. A man working in the back came out to bring us our food and he was very kind and was full of smiles, but the man up front who takes my order is almost always borderline rude, especially over the phone. In a nutshell, the portions are a bit lacking. If you're really hungry, an entree isn't going to do you justice. The chicken is good - falling off the bond tender and juicy, but it's not really a half chicken as it states on the menu. It's more like a quarter of a chicken. The beef ribs are huge, but don't have a lot of meat on them. The cornbread muffins taste more like some sort of a lemon cake than actual cornbread :(The greens and baked beans, however, are amazingly delicious. But be careful - sometimes the beans can be a little too sweet, which I actually like, but my boyfriend didn't really care for them. Fries are good too, but are a little on the salty side, which didn't bother me because I enjoy sodium lol. The last time I came in, I got an order for carry out and they didn't give us our second order of mac-n-cheese, which turned out to be ok because we ended up barely touching the one we did get (it was really greasy and not too flavorful). I didn't care for the coleslaw at all either, which really saddened me because it's one of my favorite things to eat with BBQ.I wanted to love this place, but for now I think I just kinda like it. It's conveniently located and open late, but Berry's down the road really is the best in the area when it comes to BBQ. Oh hell yeah.A rainy Sunday at the laundromat in White Center? It's cold-ass grey out and we're hungry. Barbecue it is. Walking in from the winter and having it be warm and thick with the sweet, smoky smell was fantastic.The lady that seated us wasn't all that friendly/welcoming, but the guy who came out of the kitchen later (Mike?) to ask about the food and say hello more than made up for it. I love it when someone creates food and cares about whether the people eating it loved it.I loved the extensive choice of sides. I don't remember them all, but they included cornbread muffin, baked beans, coleslaw, mac and cheese, and a lot more.I had the pulled pork slinger (pulled pork on a bun topped with coleslaw) with medium-heat bbq sauce and a side of the mac and cheese. The pulled pork was delicious,, cooked tender without being mushy, with excellent flavour that had my mouth watering. The bbq sauce was tangy and good but not too spicy-I'd go hot next time. Coleslaw was largely unremarkable but good and satisfying, as was the mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was cooked well, still with a bit of tooth in the middle, and if it had a bit more cheese flavour, would be the perfect comfort food. As it was, I happily ate the whole thing, fighting my boyfriend for the last bits.He was more adventurous and opted to try a vegetarian option, called the Queen something or something queen - bbq eggplant, onion, peppers etc. in a sweet-hot bbq sauce on a bun. My bite was delicious and satisfying, and he seemed to really love it.At $8-9 per sandwich it's not super cheap, but you get a big portion of really good food, It's well worth it. We'll be back for sure. :) Uncle Mike's BBQ is a fantastic new restaurant down in the heart of White Center. &#160;I'm not a BBQ expert, but am definitely a fan of flavor and unlike most of Seattle, Uncle Mike can bring it.I'm a vegetarian, so I tried the BBQ tofu sandwich and it was surprisingly good - lots of flavor and heat without losing the authentic smoky taste. &#160;A pretty big accomplishment for tofu at an otherwise meat-o-centric restaurant, I'd say. &#160;Fries and the bean &amp; rice were delicious as well. &#160;I didn't try to peach cobbler, but my wife and nephew loved it.Highly recommended for families and dates, followed by video games at Full Tilt afterward. Get the cole slaw, red beans &amp; rice and the pulled pork sandwich. I really do love this place... if only they had beer too, then it would be perfect. What a great surprise to find this place in the heart of White Center. &#160;I'm not familiar w/ the area at all and as a vegetarian I didn't have high hopes. &#160;But they had two great veggie sandwiches that were outstanding and most of their sides are veggie too. &#160;We had the Mac N Cheese and the baked beans and both were great. &#160;The beans were really sweet...like dessert sweet but still really good. &#160;Service was great! &#160;You feel like you're a guest in someone's home and they took a lot of pride in their food. &#160;My only complaint was that they have a TV and it was a bit too loud. Continuing a search for great BBQ in Seattle, we decided to head down to Uncle Mike's in White Center. &#160;I got a great feeling when we walked into the restaurant. &#160;It's bright and tidy and we were greeted with friendly, welcoming smiles. I ordered a combo plate with pork ribs. Really tasty meat on the pork ribs here, although I found Mike's sauces to be missing some kick. &#160;For a little context, I'm typically a big fan of tangy Carolina style vinegar sauces and bold and sweet Kansas City bbq.I also found the hot links to fall a little flat. &#160;But I really felt like they put their hearts in the food here, and I expect to be back sometime to give them another try. Having just arrived at SeaTac on a late afternoon flight, my wife and I were ready for some real food. &#160;We scanned for nearby places on Yelp mobile, and decided to try Uncle Mike's BBQ based on the reviews. &#160;This turned out to be an excellent choice. &#160;Uncle Mike's is a bright and tidy neighborhood eatery, and Mike himself is a warm and gracious host who made us feel very welcome.We ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the pork rib dinner. &#160;Each entr&#233;e included at least two sides that can be selected from a choice of about a dozen. &#160;The pork sandwich was substantial, heaped with tender meat, and topped with a tangy sauce. &#160;(Uncle Mike's provides three tasty BBQ sauces with different levels of heat.) &#160;The pork ribs were outstanding, not overcooked, and the succulent meat was rich and flavorful while not being overpowered by the sauce.The mac and cheese side was a great surprise...home-made, nicely spiced, and a great accompaniment to our meaty entrees. &#160; Fries were hand-cut thick using fresh potatoes, and perfectly seasoned. &#160;Other sides we tried included baked beans and coleslaw, both very good. &#160;The grand finale to this wonderful meal was the home made sweet potato pie. &#160;(For that alone I would go to Uncle Mike's BBQ.) &#160;This is "slow" food, and gives the distinct impression of being carefully and lovingly prepared.I have enjoyed fine BBQ in its different styles during my travels in many places throughout the country, and can honestly say that Uncle Mike's compares favorably with the best that I have had. &#160;It's the real deal! &#160;We received good value at what I consider to be very reasonable prices. &#160;I highly recommend this establishment, and look forward to my next Uncle Mike's BBQ experience. We found Uncle Mike's BBQ to be bright and clean. &#160;There were 4 TVs showing a variety of college football games; we came in for lunch on a Saturday.The gentleman who waited on us was friendly. &#160;The menu is pretty straightforward, entr&#233;es are $10 to $12 and sandwiches are $8 to $9. &#160;Your options are essentially beef, pork, chicken and hot links plus soup. &#160;They also serve Jarritos and Full Tilt ice cream - yum! &#160;There are three different homemade BBQ sauces on the table of varying heat. &#160;We sampled them all and liked them.We had beef brisket sandwiches and found them to be tender and flavorful. &#160;The fries were large-cut and well seasoned with salt, pepper and herbs; we found them to be a bit unevenly cooked, though. &#160;The portions were large so we only ate half and took the rest to go. &#160;Two sandwiches and two drinks came to $20.Overall a good experience. &#160;We'll definitely come back to Uncle Mike's! Solid food, super nice people. I came here with a friend who had been in a few times before, and with hugs all around, it felt more like walking into a relative's house, but the kind of relative you like because they serve you delicious food. Mike talked me through the menu, and since I wasn't feeling too hungry I ordered a few sides: baked beans, greens and cornbread, all of which was great. My friend ordered a bunch of bbq meatiness, and he loved it. He also ordered the dirty rice, which was a little dry, but when mixed with my baked beans was divine. Overall, I would say that this place might not blow you away with their food, but they definitely don't disappoint, and they will make you feel at home. Glad to have another family run business in White Center! Really friendly staff and great bbq. They also have really good fries no one else in seattle does fries like theirs.t. I prefer to get there pork ribs but they also offer beef as well and there hotlinks are awesome. Prices are also extremely reasonable as well. Uncle mike's has definitely become one of my favorite places to go eat, and it's not just the food. The people are awesome! &#160;Tonight was an Easter dinner special of ham and brisket. &#160;The ham had a fantastic pineapple glaze on the side and the brisket, well, you can see my other review about the brisket:-) Best soul food in White Center.When the we (party of 4) rolled in, Uncle Mike came out of the kitchen and greeted us, took our orders, and was incredibly, well, hospitable! &#160;He made sure each order was tailored to each of our desires (just momma's cookin at home!) and remembered 2 of our guests (they had came here previously) by name already. &#160;Mike's got a great memory! I snagged the grilled veggie burger with a side of jalapeno cornbread, and MMMMM so so so good! &#160;I could eat a whole plate of those grilled veggies. &#160;Mike checked in with us several times while we were devouring our soul food, made sure everything was OK, took time to get to know us a bit better, and even gave us lollipops at the end (hahah). &#160;Next time I'll have to try the Mac&amp;Cheese and/or the pork slinger. I spent last summer trying out various BBQ joints around town and was thrilled to see one opening up right near my house. I read all the raves and was so excited when I finally found the time to go. I must say that I was disappointed. The food was good, when it finally arrived, but not mind blowing like I had expected based on the previous reviews. I ordered the beef brisket sandwich with the Mac &amp; Cheese side. The mac and cheese while it tasted good, looked oily and like it had been sitting around awhile. The brisket sandwich was much better, though it could have used more sauce. . My biggest complaint about the restaurant was the service. At most BBQ joints you order at the counter, but when we walked in a waitress who seemed annoyed to see us rushed us to sit down and took our order. There was only one other party in the restaurant, and the staff was invisible most of our visit until I realized that they were sitting at the counter waiting for us to pay. The whole experience was really strange. If it had not been for the awkward and unfriendly atmosphere I would be likely to return sooner to try out more of the menu options, as it is though, I think that it will take some time for me to get up the nerve to go back. For a similar price but much better service I would recommend 'Gabriel's Fire.' It's farther from home, but much more homey. I'm not a BBQ expert. I don't duke it out over Kansas City vs. Carolina vs. Whatever. I'm just a WC local who is happy for another good food option in the 'hood. And Uncle Mike's is pretty good. We've been there a few times, always for take-out (we have a baby so it's not always convenient to sit-in). Everything we've tried has been tasty. Muffins are indeed a little too crumbly and dry. And every time we go, they leave something out of the order. Either a side or a sauce (never a main dish though). So make sure to check the bag when you leave! Is it a destination place? No, but it's a good neighborhood joint. So I decided to give this place a try tonight for dinner after reading the reviews on Yelp. I sure am glad I did! It is nice to know there is a good BBQ place just 10 min from home. The 2 gentlemen that greeted me were fun &amp; friendly. I said it was my first time and asked for a little direction. They suggested the rib tips YUMMMMM oh I am glad I had those; they also recommended the BBQ beans well only my husband makes better. I have not had great beans like those before at a restaurant. I will be getting them again! They also recommended the potato salad. It was good but I am just not a fan for that type of potato salad, but I still ate every bite of it. Next time I will try the Mac &amp; Cheese. Now just as I was leaving Mike offered me a sample of a new desert he does not even have on the menu yet it was "gooey" something. OMG it was sooooo good!!! I defiantly want to see that on the desert menu. He did say if I wanted it, &#160;to call a day before, at least until it is popular with others. Well yelpers... ask for a sample:}THANKS for the great referral; I will be going there again. This is an awesome place. I had a pulled pork sandwich with a side of fries and coleslaw. All of it was amazing. The coleslaw was very fresh with from scratch sauce, not the restaraunt premade stuff. The fries were hand cut, hot, and seasoned perfectly and the pulled pork sandwich was better than the best homemade. They toast the inside of the bread so it doesn't absorb the sauce and you get this perfect crunch. A generous portion of pulled pork with just the right amount of sauce so it is not swimming in it. I will definetly be back again!! If you love BBQ you got to try it!! We've eaten here twice and both times the food was pretty tasty. My family enjoyed their sandwiches. i had the pork ribs and it was pretty good. It was a bit too chewy and not BBQ-y enough. The beans were pretty darn amazing though! The corned bread/muffin tasted a bit too grainy and seemed like it was made out of a box. I think there's room for improvement and I'd be willing to give them a second shot. This place is great. The owner, Mike is very friendly an for $10 you get a huge portion of food. I found this place when it snowed in December and have gone back a couple times since. The macaroni is great and the peach cobbler is even better. This place is really good. &#160;I suggest the pork sandwich. &#160;Yum! I rolled into White Center thinking to try Proletarian Pizza (another time, guys) but after having an "Irish Breakfast" for brunch, even at 8 pizza just seemed a little heavy - and I'd spotted "barbecue" as I pulled in to park. The folks there are nice, darned nice. Very accommodating. The food is nourishing, and plenty of it. I had the beef brisket dinner with two sides, macaroni &amp; cheese and the seasoned fries. The brisket was well-cooked and tender, but there wasn't a smoke ring (or any hint of smokiness, darn it). Good bbq sauce, but a tad mild - for those who like spice, I'm thinking bypass the regular and go for the hot. Haven't tried it yet, but I have hope. The Mac'n'Cheese was unusual, with a combination of a white cheese with *I think* a shredded cheddar topping melted on - and a hidden kick hiding underneath. Zesty.Finally, the seasoned fries were soggy but good and retained heat well (darned if I know how they pulled that off). Can't say I was impressed by the cornbread muffin (served cold, in cellophane) that was dry and slightly burnt. Not a real kicking dose of seasoning, but still quite good. If I could rate this place 3.5 overall with a 5 on hospitality, I'd do it...as it is, I'm calling it a 4 and giving it another shot...they show promise. Yum!! That's all I have to say for Uncle Mike! OK, the pulled pork sandwich was great, tender, flavorful pork on a roll that wasn't too much. I'm not a big sandwich fan, but this sandwich was excellent. Tried the beef brisket on another trip and it too was tender, falling apart as it came off the bun. The standout was by far the greens. Oh. my. god. I'm a big fan of the greens in general and these are by far the best I've had in the Northwest. Service is a little slow, but I prefer to look at it as relaxed and easy-going. Staff was solicitous and Uncle Mike is friendly and helpful. Really trying to make our community a better place. The beans and rice are also outstanding. Top notch bbq. &#160;We ordered brisket and ribs with coleslaw, cornbread, fries and baked beans. &#160;Cornbread was average but everything else was great. &#160;Kind of an interesting location, the restaurant is very nice inside. &#160;Service was great, Uncle Mike is awesome. &#160;Would definitely try again. Was extremely happy with my dining experience. &#160;Talk about down home real food! &#160;I had the pulled-pork sandwich and was blown away! &#160;Fantastic! &#160; I loved the Mac and cheese. &#160; Mike is a great guy, very friendly, helpful, and sincere. &#160;He treated me to a piece of sweet potatoe pie (homemade). &#160;It was wonderful. &#160; &#160;While I don't live in the Seattle area, it is definately a dining destination for me in the future. &#160;A final word, don't be put off by the neighborhood, Uncle Mikes is a gem worth searching for! After seeing Yelp's note re Uncle Mike's BBQ in White Center, we were looking forward to checking it out the next time we were in the area. &#160;For the two of us we ordered the three meat combo with two sides: &#160;$17 got us 4-5 slices of brisket, 2 pork ribs and a chicken leg/thigh combo. &#160;Got the mac and cheese and coleslaw for our sides, an extra side of greens ($3) and a piece of the apple spice cake. &#160;I think the total was about $25. &#160;All of the sides came in high quality (think- reuseable fake tupperware) 8 oz. containers. &#160;Unfortunately, they don't retain heat that well and were only lukewarm by the time we got over to the West Seattle junction area. &#160;I thought the meats were really well seasoned and had a good smoke flavor. &#160;The "regular" sauce was a bit spicy for my taste but the bf liked it. &#160;The mac and cheese was mostly a white, slightly cheesey sauce with two globs of cheddar. &#160;Nothing spectacular about the greens or coleslaw. &#160;The cake was good and moist and the streusel-y topping was delish. &#160;Might go back to try a sandwich the next time I'm in the area. I really enjoyed the pulled BBQ sandwich. While I was eating it all I could think about was how yummy it was. They have an option to add cold slaw and I highly recommend it. The BBQ chicken sandwich is also great. BBQ back beans were perfect. The restaurant was really clean . Absolutely the best BBQ sauce ever! &#160;Smoky and not too sweet. &#160;I ordered hot and spicy and it was great. &#160;The sides I ordered were greens and baked beans and they were terrific. &#160;I ordered the combo so that I could try everything and my favorite was the pork ribs followed by the brisket. &#160;My husband had the pulled pork sandwich and was quite pleased. &#160;I don't quite understand the less favorable reviews. &#160;This is not low-fat &#160;nose in the air food. &#160;It is the real comfort food that your southern mom would make! &#160;I thought the server was nice and friendly.
I've always felt that having breakfast at Pete's egg nest is either hit or miss. I ate there this morning and enjoyed a solid Joe's special, but the hash browns are frozen and uninspired. Sometimes they're crispy and sometimes they're not. Like so many restaurants, they serve their huge portions with a shovel and a smile. It's not about the size of the portion, ie. Gordito's, but savoring the quality of each and every bite. I wish they would upgrade the quality of their coffee, but then it's just a reflection of their uninspired fare. There are definitely better breakfast joints, in and around the Greenwood area, to enjoy a good breakfast. JR Ever since I moved to Seattle I rarely have gone out to breakfast. &#160;Maybe it's because I can't seem to find a breakfast restaurant that has a really, really good rating. &#160;Or, maybe I enjoy spending my money on all the tasty restaurants that serve dinner. &#160;What I do know is that I probably won't be returning to Pete's Egg Nest. &#160;If I could give this restaurant 2 1/2 stars I would. &#160;2 stars seems too critical and 3 stars seems too complimentary. &#160;I arrived at Pete's Egg Nest on a Sunday morning and I was totally ready to have a typical greasy spoon breakfast. &#160;Although I had read all of the reviews that said the omelette's were fabulous I don't particularly care for that much egg, so I decided to order french toast-- one of my favorite breakfast dishes. &#160;My boyfriend ordered the blueberry pancakes. &#160;Both dishes were so-so. &#160;I could have made better french toast at home and my boyfriend thought his pancakes were okay, but nothing spectacular. &#160;The coffee was good and the refills seemed adequate. &#160;All in all, I don't think I'll return to Pete's Egg Nest. &#160;I'm still searching for that fabulous greasy spoon breakfast! Great for hangovers!!!Great food in huge portions, but the coffee is lousy, there's always a wait on the weekend, the service is slow, and don't try and go with a group larger then 4.All that said...I will always come back. Well what can I say about this place, we arrived at 11 am, waited for 30 minutes outside then waited for 20 minutes before we got served and another 20 minutes to get our food. &#160;In that time we were passed over being seated as we were a party of 3, 2 couples were seated before us and when our turn came they were sat at a 4 person table.The service: From the host to the server was very poor, a lot of grumbling and not very friendly.The food: I know it's a greasy spoon but the hash browns were super greasy, the omelet was ok but boring.I don't see the attraction to this place, will never go back! I wasn't raised on eggs and hashed browns. &#160;They are, to me, no less exotic than pan-Asian or even African. &#160;This is because it took me 15 years to develop the ability to eat breakfast. &#160;Places like Pete's are why I'm glad I did.Pete's, located in a lovely part of Greenwood, is a place where you're treated like a regular no matter what. &#160;The older Greek woman (whose name I didn't catch) will make you feel at home. &#160;The coffee (which isn't great, but is good enough) flows freely. &#160;But the food is where it's at.The Greek scramble is the dish to get. &#160;It's a masterpiece of eggs with gyro meat, a light red sauce, tomatoes, olives, spinach, feta, with a side of tzatziki sauce and peta. &#160;What a breakfast!My companion's dish (the Napoli Scramble) was meaty and good, and would have been recommendable otherwise, but it was outshone by the Greek scramble. &#160;Not that it matters - no matter what you go for, Pete's is great. Disclaimer: &#160;We didn't actually get to eat there. &#160;We're new in town, and were trying our first breakfast place. &#160;We walked 20 minutes in the cold to get to Pete's with our baby in her stroller. &#160;The hostess took our name and said that we would figure something out about the stroller (which folds up). &#160;15 minutes later, she came outside and said that we would be next, and that we would figure out the stroller situation. &#160;10 minutes after that, my wife went in to check and was told that they couldn't accomodate us. &#160;Since it had just started to rain, we headed back home. &#160; They could have at least come outside and apologized or something. &#160;This was pretty shabby. I don't go out to breakfast very often. &#160;This is mostly because the only days I have to go are on weekends...and on those mornings, I'd rather spend the time sleeping. &#160;But a friend of mine came down from Bellingham for the weekend and we thought we'd have brunch together. &#160;After some discussion, we decided on Pete's Egg Nest. &#160;I didn't get a chance to check Yelp for reviews first, so I went in with zero preconceived notions or things to look out for. &#160;We ended up there on a Sunday at about 11am and only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table, which surprised me. &#160;The place was pretty packed and everyone looked happy, so I was excited. &#160;The older woman who seated us was very pleasant. &#160;I was rather pleased to see that they had a lot of vegetarian options, since I am going through the phase of trying to eliminate meat from my diet. &#160;When I think of breakfast, I think of ham and bacon and lots of meat. &#160;But I actually had lots of things to choose from on the menu that would satisfy my vegetarian needs. &#160;I went with a veggie scramble with hashbrowns and an english muffin. &#160;It was very very delicious! &#160;I couldn't eat the whole thing because it was so gigantic, so I brought the rest home to my boyfriend, who hungrily shoveled it down with happiness. &#160;My friends scramble was equally delicious (I believe it was the California scramble) and we both went away happy.Service was very prompt and friendly. &#160;I would definitely come back here again for an excellent greasy spoon breakfast.
Reader, I don't know you. We've never met. You might be a smart person or a fun person or a beautiful person or a rich person. If someone told me the only way I could eat at Canlis again was by murdering you, you would be dead.Mom, thank you for raising me. I am so grateful I grew up in a loving environment where you and Dad encouraged me to follow my dreams, even the dumb ones like growing up to be a fire hydrant. You were a great mother. If someone told me the only way I could eat at Canlis again was by slitting your throat while you slept, I just hope Dad would be okay. Unless someone told me the same thing about him, in which case I would be an orphan.Do not THINK about going to Canlis. Just. Go. This is one of those rare restaurants where the price is entirely justified. If you want to throw down for a meal, this is how it ought to be. We had the tasting menu and a shared gustatory orgasm. "What did you eat?" you might be asking. "Thompson, tell me about the delicious and flavorful chicken with the truffles under the skin!" you are saying while sitting alone in your room at your monitor. "When one of the desserts had a problem did your server unleash the fucking dessert dragons and give two extra desserts while apologizing so profusely you were worried she might whip out a samurai sword and disembowel herself for the dishonor of your yogurt not setting correctly?" you are asking, perhaps. Yes, that did happen. Because the service at Canlis is not like being waited on by people, it's like being given food by the fucking seraphim. "How was the fresh caprese?" you ask."How were the mixed veggies?""How was the lamb, and did every wine taste like it begged to be eaten with every individual course of the tasting menu?"Why the fuck are you asking me these things? Did you read that second paragraph? I said I WOULD MURDER MY PARENTS TO EAT HERE AGAIN!I would crucify a kitten.I would nuke Wyoming. I would kill you and everyone you loved like a gluttonous Kaiser Soze to eat here again. Just be glad I know about airplanes and Open Table and that I have a job. Stars were invented so I could give Canlis five of them. This restaurant gets high scores in the view, the impeccable service, and food presentation. &#160;Unfortunately, the food does not taste as good as it looks. &#160;The restaurant and the view here is as beautiful as everyone describes. &#160;Ask for a table with a window view. &#160;Watch the boats and planes come into the lake. &#160;If you come early, you can watch the sun come down over the hill.The service is topnotch. &#160;Our server was a petite Thai lady who is very friendly and personable. &#160;I had dinner at Rover's a couple of nights later and they really could learn a thing or two from Canlis. &#160;The service was choreographed perfectly! &#160;It's nice being pampered every once in awhile.Lastly, the food. &#160;While my hubby had the tasting menu, I choose a 3 course dinner. &#160; I cannot rave enough about the attention to detail with how each course is plated. &#160;The colors of each plate was so appetizing! &#160;Our food did taste good, it just wasn't excellent and lacked the ooo's and ahhhh's after each bite. &#160;And I just have to add, the rabbit ribs are a bit ridiculous! &#160;It was so tiny, I felt for the poor baby rabbit that was slaughtered for my meal! &#160;(See my pics)All in all, I would come back again and again. &#160;Beautiful restaurant, beautiful meal and wonderful experience! Not as good as Providence (LA), but better than STUDIO at the Montage. &#160;One of those "gotta try once, special occasion joints." &#160;The dress code's a bit stuffy, but i understand the premise, and its nice to wear a suit every now and then. &#160;The view is spectacular... cannot get any better. &#160;The service was very very good. &#160;I bit slow, but we had a 3 1/2 hour window, so it was cuttin it close. &#160;on to the food:Canlis Prawns w/ Vermouth Buttah... &#160;Damn good prawns... some of the best!Strawberry Gazpacho with geoduck, scallop. &#160;The only glitch of the night.Canlis Salad: &#160;Very good greens... bacon was nice and crispMain Lobster: &#160;Hands down, most perfectly cooked lobster i've ever had...tail was succulent, claws were tender and sweet.NY Strip Loin: &#160;Aged Nebraska, medium rare.... Good, but unspectacular.Chocolate on Chocolate Dessert: &#160;Imagine the typical chocolate lava cake...ehh...above avg.A very nice place to celebrate the 5 yr anniversary for the mrs. and me. &#160;Stuffy atmosphere, but its ok..... just go with the flow. Insanely expensive. &#160;For that, you are pampered and called by name and served as if you were the Crown Princess of Denmark. &#160;However, the food is inferior to less expensive places around town. &#160;Nothing special about my King Salmon except the heart-stopping price, nothing special about Hapa Boy's lamb, unless you count the odd thing that the waitress told us about it looking more "rare because the sun is setting." What? &#160; My riesling was sweet enough to be dessert wine, which is something I wish one of the six servers who handed off at our table had warned me about. The much lauded Canlis salad was refreshingly minty but not worth $14. The carrot soup was...carroty. &#160;The view: spectacular. &#160;The desserts are the story here; we loved loved loved the Chocolate Covered Chocolate with salted caramel ice cream. &#160;But I left feeling guilty that our date set my boyfriend back so much, even if he was happy to take me there. &#160;It just didn't feel worth it, and we eat at a lot of pricey places. [What can I say? &#160;He's a foodie]My advice: &#160;Come for dessert later in the evening. The bar has the same view. &#160;Just try and sit far away from the pianist. &#160;It's like having dinner in Nordstrom's. This is definitely a special occasion sort of place. Every table has a spectacular view. &#160;The menu was small and the food was great. The strawberry gazpacho with geoduck and scallops was amazingly refreshing on a hot summer day. All of the entrees were also amazing though a little pricey. Contrary to a lot of the reviews, I kind of enjoyed the top forty music on the piano. Nothing like a classical version of alejandro to put the group in a fabulous mood! The Canlis, though not for everyday use, is what Seattle needs. &#160;Sometimes, you should wear a tie.Sometimes, you need to take your lady's new dress out to dinner.The Canlis is one of the few places in Seattle, and in my limited travels that has a bar as good as the kitchen, that has service as good as the food, that is as timeless as it is relevant.It is not as expensive as you think it is and you will get much more than your money's worth. &#160;To crudely address that, every hotel downtown costs more than the Canlis for crappy insincere corporate service delivered by an angry employee in polyester.Try the Canlis for happy hour, sit in the bar, talk about that novel you are working on, and have yourself a Jack Donaghy moment when you realize you deserve this. &#160;Get a little drunk, and ask for the special scotch selection, one of the best in the country, take a cab home, wear a suit to work the next day, and get a raise.And tip that Valet I absolutely love Canlis. &#160;The waiters, the atmosphere, the view and the food are definitely amazing. &#160;I'd expect nothing less for the price.I HIGHLY recommend the Mahi, mango creme brulee, and lychee sorbet. &#160;I'm getting hungry just thinking about it all. Years since I've been here...and it's basically the same. &#160;Great view. &#160;Spectacular service. &#160;Food was solid, but maybe not outstanding. &#160; We came during restaurant week and we all stuck to the prixe. &#160;I ordered the lamb but stole a bite of the halibut, which I thought was superior. &#160; A crust on the outside but almost fluffy on the inside. &#160;Pacing of the dishes was spot on and the service was not invasive. &#160;We were comfortable and didn't feel rushed. &#160;My only knock was the music, which was supplied by a piano player in a corner. &#160; A slow version of Lady Gaga's Poker Face during dinner? &#160;Really? This was the best dinner I had while in Seattle. &#160;I was very impressed with the service from the start.The Valet took our car and brought it to us after we were done with our dinner without having to give us a tag. &#160;Very impressive.There is a dress code here, but it makes the dining experience that much better.We had the tasting menu here and we were able to change it to how we liked it. &#160;We replaced the rabbit with the hamachi.My favorite dish however was the yellow fin tuna.Presentation and taste of every dish was amazing.All fine dining restaurants need to take notes from Canlis. One of the best dinners I've had in my life. For every reason a dinner can be good.I took a coworker's gleaming recommendation and booked reservations on our trip to Seattle for my bf's birthday. Forget the Space Needle, forget Pike's Place, THIS is the real reason we made the trip up!!Service is outstanding. But not in that pretentious eying you while you chew way, more like a casual yet continual presence. They even have a guy whose sole purpose is to refill the bread bowl. The wine list was as thick as my AP Biology textbook, and just as robust!We received a lovely amuse bouche of leek sunchoke soup with a touch of truffle/truffle oil and micro-greens. What an intriguing little cup. I opted for the famous Canlis salad and a steak with the truffle fries. The salad is so refreshing, and the dressing is so good I totally cleaned the plate! The steak was cooked perfectly. The potatoes come on little buttery pedestals of mash. The fries come out so crunchy and tasty, possibly the best I've ever had. Their creme brulee has the best sugar coating - it completely covers the top, and gives a nice crunch with each spoonful you take.Our waiter totally latched on when I told him I was from SF. We had a great conversation about how he'd visited and stayed in the Haight district (of all places). Good times.The real piece de resistance was the pianist. He jammed all night playing everything from Moon River to Lady GAGA's Paparazzi to Ella &amp; the Duke's Don't Get Around Much Anymore to Taio Cruz' Dynamite. I kept thinking, oh no he didn't....OH YES HE DID! ...and that made my evening. This was my last dinner for my first visit to Seattle. What a memorable experience. OK I admit, Seattle has better food options then Reno, I wanna come back!These business dinners usually come to these sorts of places, meaning up scale "new American". It will meet a whole range of tastes and nobody will be offended by any thing too extreme, liike no unidentified tide pool animals. There were 15 of us for dinner. We had our own room called the Executive Room, so so nice! The service was amazing and professional without being stuffy. We all dress up for this dinner, a more formal affair, so I had to watch myself...and not do anything out of line.So, for starters I got the Dungeness Crab Cake ($18). I think this one beat the one I had on a &#160;San Diego trip. Perfect. Other people had various seafood apps, and I saw a steak tartare too.For the main course, I was looking at the Duck for 2, but I had to find someone to share it with. I thought the Main Lobster would be nice, but I didn't want to make an ass of myself by ordering a $78 entree. I got a co-worker to share the duck for 2 so $96 for 2 entrees wasn't so bad. The duck was a roasted duck breast that was tender and not dried out. OK, so I could of ate another one! Dessert was the Creme Brulee, a nice version, but not super tasty, but none of the other desserts seemend that good ( for my tastes anyhow) so I got the Creme Brulee.The whole experience was fantastic, if a bit stuffy at first with the crowd I was with, but it loosened up as the night went on, with the wine flowing. Can't wait to come back...with a smaller party. Now I have to go home tomorrow. This is really more of a 4-star place for the food, but 5-stars on just about everything else. &#160;I wish I could give it a 4.5This restaurant was recommended to us by friends so we hosted a business dinner here two nights ago.First off, THE PARKING IS TRICKY. &#160;Some GPSes will find it, but really, use a map, and if you can get satellite view. &#160;The entrance is IMMEDIATELY before you get onto the bridge and is an awkward entrance. &#160;If you have any questions, call them.Secondly, there is a formal dress code.The service is impeccable. &#160;I mean everything from the timing to the plating, the ma&#238;tre d was great in explaining every dish and wine off the cuff, and the view was stunning. &#160;Valets take your car without giving you a ticket and so does the coat-check, but they remember exactly who has what. &#160;Very impressive.The food was great. &#160;I wouldn't classify it as mind-blowing, but it was still excellent. &#160;Since it was a business dinner, I didn't get a chance to sample around, but from the looks of how everyone finished their plates, the steaks were all delicious and so was the duck (perfectly cooked). &#160;We had several of the appetizers and desserts and you really can't go wrong, but definitely talk to your server about recommendations.One thing that was kind of weird was they have a lounge pianist. &#160;And instead of hearing the lush classical/jazzy music like at a Nordstrom, this guy was playing "Poker Face", "Don't Stop Believing", "Fireflies", "Beat It", etc. &#160;Interesting arrangements, but our table conversation kept getting side tracked by the occasional, "...is he playing what I think he is?" &#160;Not a detractor, but kind of strange in a funny way.The wine list is a BOOK with an INDEX. &#160;Seriously, you'd better start cracking once you sit down. &#160;Looks like the thesis my sister wrote for her PhD.We easily dropped almost $150 per person that dinner so just be conscious of how quickly it all adds up. &#160;I'm not sure if it's really worth that much for the food you get, but it's good enough that you should try it. There are places you eat at, and then there are places you experience. There are a few places that become a moment lost in time forever encased in a flawless memory. Canlis was one of those places.While I would not murder my own parents, like dear Thompson P described in his review, I do understand his passion for this place. I tried food I have never even thought to try before such as fro gras. I was amazed how good it tasted. Their wine selection is the best I have ever seen in Seattle. I think you could spend hours and hours looking over the wine. I have never tasted a finer wine then I drank that night. Every course was amazing, every course was done perfectly. The atmosphere was fantastic, our table was far enough away from everyone else that it seemed like each of us where having our own private dining experience. The service was more then incredible. After we ordered our bottle of wine they offered us a complimentary tasting of a 1973 spatlese that they had found earlier in the night. I was expecting a small sip of a taste and they brought out a half glass for both of us and it was the best spatlese I have ever tasted. While we enjoyed dessert they offered to take our leftovers to our car. I was dumbfounded by that, because I have never had any restaurant offer that. Yet they did it with a smile and insisted that they did so to give us the most table room for dessert. They even offered us a tour of the restaurant despite it being close go closing time. We declined because we we're so taken in and stuffed full. It was truly an experience. During our visit to Seattle, we went to Canlis to have a wonderful dinner and to check out one of Seattle's finest. &#160;It was a very memorable dinner as we were upstairs in one of the private rooms (the Cache). &#160;The quality of the food was excellent and the Wagyu Tenderloin and that Kobe beef was just sooooooooo good. &#160;Even to this day, we still talk about how excellent of the Kobe beef.I have no doubt that when we return to Seattle, we will be making another special visit to Canlis! Hi All, Just a quick one today. You can read other reviews about the incredible food &amp; wine, I'll keep my review to the one thing that really stuck out in my head after my last visit here: the lack of snobbery!! Oh, I love going to fancy places and enjoying what they have to offer - but I can't stand waiters, hosts, the valet guy (especially the valet guy!!), who think that to give good service means a turned up nose and a "chilly" demeanor. Not so at Canlis - the people are totally warm, sincere, and very welcoming - even the valet! Their great attitude totally made the experience something special, so much that spending a couple hindered on a meal is totally acceptable. Go here for all your fancy dining needs!! With its old-world sophistication and air of romance, Canlis is one of the finest restaurants in America. Loving preparations of the restaurant garden's own produce show up on beautiful plates every season of the year. Resist the urge to lick the amuse-bouche plates - the corn and pea puree I had was the tastiest thing resembling baby food that I've ever tasted. Hearts of palm, then butter doused halibut. By the end of the meal, some seven courses later, I felt as if I had been read aloud a novel in food. Despite the dress code, there was a relaxation attained at Canlis. For an high-falutin' occasion this place has the culinary prowess and refined atmosphere to fit the bill.Special marks for serviceMark Canlis, third-generation owner of the restaurant, and a bottle of his specially made Canlis Cuvee arrived at our table, and we weren't the only ones that received this special treatment. His attentive nature was natural, but he also knew what was going on all around him, down to a woman's carrot allergy at the four-top across the room. I'm giving this place 5 stars for the service alone! &#160;Absolutely fantastic.Food was good, but we ordered the duck, they brought it out to us and it looked amazing, they then took it back in the kitchen and carved off the brests and fed us those.. &#160;umm what happened to the rest of my duck?? &#160;That was the most disappointing thing about our visit. Ecstatic: me finding out that Canlis was participating in Seattle Restaurant Week and offering 3 course dinners for $25!Kindness: the attitude of all the waitstaff we encountered. &#160;They made us feel like we entered their home and were honored guests, they were great at anticipating needs, addressing concerns without hesitation and worked as a cohesive team. &#160;They were so friendly, not pretentious at all. &#160;They offer purse hooks (to hang your purse on the table), great little detail! &#160;They also describe each dish as it arrives and cleared the crumbs from the tablecloth as all good waiters do.Dazzled: by the presentation and taste of the food. &#160;Everything was above average, but the Braised Lamb with handmade fettuccine was melt-in-your-mouth good. &#160;The noodles tasted great, but that lamb...Best. Lamb. I've. Ever. Had. *wipes drool*Technically we had a 5-course meal with the tiny added items. &#160;Here's what we had:#1 - Amuse Bouche: green gazpacho w/olive oil and red pepper#2a - Canlis Salad: romaine, bacon, Romano cheese, fresh mint, oregano and a dressing of lemon, olive oil and coddled egg#2b - Smoked Cauliflower Soup: served chilled, with Dungeness crab, cucumber and harissa pepper#3a - Halibut: ramps, preserved lemon and peas#3b - Braised Lamb: handmade fettuccine with tomato confit, Taggiasco olives and fava beans#4a - Rhubarb Shortcake: strawberries, basil and Devonshire cream - least favorite dish of the meal#4b - Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee: strawberries, mango and house-made sorbet#5 - Tiny bite size cakesTip 1: we found parking just down the hill on Dexter. &#160;Since it's right off of Highway 99, there is no parking option close to the front of the restaurant besides the valet service's lot.Tip 2: we saw tables open up around 8:30 and they were not refilled, so since the waiting list is 80+ people strong, try calling and seeing if they can accommodate you later in the evening.Overall, the building is beautiful, the location offers great views, the service is fantastic and the food is great, eating at Canlis is an experience and a great one at that. Its an experience, like any other hyped up, grand shi-shi, impress your friends and family experience. &#160;Great attention to detail, timing and profiles. &#160;My co-workers and I went for the last night of the 3 for $25. &#160;We lucked out and got an after work, "late" seating at 9:30. &#160;As expected, the food was very good, presentation lovely, service attentive and friendly, and view outstanding. &#160;I enjoyed it all, and felt lucky to get out of there without breaking the bank ($80 a head). &#160; The wine list is ridiculous. &#160;I saw a magnum of 1990 Burgandy priced at $17, 500, and lots of quadruple digit bottles. &#160;Its a fucking novel. &#160;Canlis is definitely the most expensive restaurant I've ever been to. &#160;Is it worth it? &#160;As a special rare treat, I'd say. &#160;This place could definitely spoil you. &#160;Our server even gave us a tour of the facility after we finished. &#160; It was a total Big Lebowski moment.....surprised he didn't start name dropping. My wife and I went here for our 5th wedding anniversary and had a great time. &#160;I want to be honest about my experience, and not all of it is positive, however it did not take away from our evening so I must give it 5 stars.#1. &#160;Billie Joe Armstrong was there. &#160;That was awesome.#2. &#160;Our food was excellent.#3. &#160;We were never mistreated, and the huge amount of staff was beyond professional.#4. &#160;They did not ridicule the wine I brought with us. &#160;:)Some of the negatives - Less to do with the restaurant and more to do with the clientelle.#1. &#160;Old people complaining about too much alcohol taste in the Grand Marnier Souffle(which the waiter comped to the codgers.)#2. &#160;Many other uppity old people apparently not enjoying themselves very much.#3. &#160;For as much as I had read and heard about the strict dress code I noticed two things: &#160;a) Some of the codgers had some of the ugliest old clothes I had ever seen. &#160;Flower pattern dressed that made them looked Amish, and am sure were circa 1972. b) Later in the evening, around 9 p.m., they actually let 2 younger couples come in, one of the men showed up in jeans and t-shirt, so they gave him a jacket. &#160;From what I understood they would turn people away for such attire.#4. &#160;Overhearing many tables telling the waiter what could have been done better to their meals like they were Top Chef judges. &#160;Anyways, it made for a funny and enjoyable evening and we look forward to going back. &#160;Just have to save up a few dollars. For my 300th review, I wanted to do something epic. Fortunately, my parents were in town for their 40th wedding anniversary, so it gave me the perfect excuse to take them out for dinner and check out Canlis. I honestly didn't know what to expect, as I've heard great things about the view and service, but at the same time, some of the comments about the food was about as flattering as review of airplane food. With somewhat lowered expectations, I was pleasantly surprised about the whole dining experience at Canlis. Yes, it is old school, yes, it is expensive, but the food was definitely better than expected and surprisingly updated. If you come here expecting beef wellington, you will be disappointed. Think Miner's lettuce salad and kona kampachi crudo as starters. Both of these were beautifully presented and were a nice light way to start the meal. The Peter Canlis Prawns were a bit more old school, as these were saut&#233;ed in dry vermouth and cream, but still the treatment was very light. Moving on to entrees, the grilled lobster with gnocchi, honshimeji and king oyster mushrooms was a hit. It's definitely pricey at $68, but the dish was perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. The New York Strip was also cooked perfectly, although compared to some of the other steaks I've had in town, wasn't outstanding. Lamb chops were a better option here, as it was definitely more flavorful without being gamy. The seared halibut with artichoke nage, tomato confit and piquillo peppers is a popular dish. I found it slightly over salted for my tastes, but it was also perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. The meal ended with a classic Grand Marnier Souffl&#233; with cr&#232;me anglaise. It's definitely something that is difficult to make and served too often anymore. But it was a nice reminder of my parents' first dining experience when they immigrated to the States almost 40 years ago. The wine list is legendary, and with over 2,500 selections, you could easily spend an hour reading it. I am a big fan of Ramey wines, but never tried one of their chardonnays. They had two versions at Canlis, so I was happy. There were also all sorts of little things that also distinguish Canlis from other restaurants in Seattle such as the valet parking without tickets, service that is graceful without being too intrusive, etc. We were also appreciated the fact that Mark Canlis took the time to congratulate my parents on their wedding anniversary and thanked us for choosing Canlis to celebrate the occasion. Overall, I was definitely impressed with my first visit here. And as I looked around the room to see a diverse group of customers, from high school students going to prom to lifelong customers who have been coming here for decades, it was cool to see that Canlis could be a special occasion restaurant for so many people. So while Canlis will probably not become a regular hangout for me, it will definitely remain a solid option for special occasions. In celebration of getting into UW Law, my wife's Aunt and Uncle invited us out to the restaurant of my choice. &#160;I have already been to Rovers twice and didn't want to make the trek to the Herb Farm, so I thought this would be a good chance to check out Canlis. When you are looking at going to Canlis, I can say that I was skeptical of anyone who didn't give it stellar reviews. &#160;Canlis did not live up to its reputation on my recent visit. &#160;As with many fine dining places, I think people have a vested interest in saying it was better than it really was because of the amount of money being spent on the meal.The Food: The most important part of a restaurant is its purpose for being, and as far as food at Canlis goes, it tries but doesn't quite get there as being worth the price. &#160;We all got the $115 tasting menu, and of the many dishes, only two or three were really very good, and even then they weren't drop dead. &#160;Started with a cocktail, I forget what mine was called, but it was well put together and the shaved ice gave it a nice feel in the mouth. &#160;The Amuse Bouche was a cauliflower soup with a fresh dungeness crab cake and caviar. &#160;The crab was gritty somehow and the caviar was bland tasting too me. &#160;The Asparagus with mussels and caviar was flavorful, and it was one of the really good courses of the evening. &#160;My wife and I normally don't enjoy raw fish, but the tuna three ways (two raw, one ceviche) made us open to trying it again. &#160;The rabbit three ways it seemed like they were trying to hide something with the heaviness of the mustard flavor on the dish, I love rabbit, but I really didn't get feel like the rabbit was the highlight on this course. &#160;The best part of the lamb saddle wasn't really the lamb (though it was cooked with good color on the outside and a beautiful pink all the way through). &#160;The best part of the dish was the pickled ramps, which I will now have to procure and pickle for myself, really yummy. &#160;Espresso sorbet and the Brioche Bread Pudding were fine as a dessert and not as heavy looking as some of the stuff coming out on other patrons' tables but were again, not to die for.The Setting: &#160;A number of good reviews said the food wasn't quite matched to the price but that the view and service were worth it. &#160;I was counting on the same to lift my review but the setting wasn't that great. &#160;We could see the view from our table but weren't right next to it, and the restaurant felt like it was really busy, not as intimate as I would have expected given its reputation. &#160;The piano playing was really fun throughout the night, with two Lady Gaga songs (Paparazzi and Poker Face), Coldplay, Green Day, and a couple Frank Sinatra classics.The Service: &#160;I thought the service was very slow. &#160;I didn't expect to rush through the meal, and I enjoy a three hour French style culinary experience, but there is a sweet spot for how long to wait between courses and they were on the long side. &#160;Our server did not seem completely at ease, though I can't complain as napkins were put in our laps (even when I got up to go to the restroom and came back) crumbs were cleared away, and new utensils brought out with each course. &#160;The valet didn't have our cars out as we came out, which I had been looking forward too, but once they saw us got the cars out without a ticket.Overall, I would say it was nice to check out Canlis and at three stars, it really is A-Ok, but it &#160;isn't worth it for a celebration dinner, even if someone else is paying. &#160;None of the four of us were impressed with the food, the service, or the ambiance. &#160;There are many Seattle fine dining restaurants with better service and food, and I plan to check more of them out before returning to Canlis. They make you feel like family every time.The food is high quality and priced accordingly, which is not the same thing as overpriced. You can go sit in the bar and enjoy James' libations and a steak for less than $80 - and you'll taste the quality in every sip and bite. I will go back again and again. Top notch presentation.Every aspect of the evening was carried out meticulously well. &#160;I had very high expectations coming in to the evening, and was slightly disappointed after all said and done. Don't get me wrong it was a wonderful meal and service was spot on all night. I shared the duck breast for two. Honestly it was the best duck that I have ever eaten. Crispy skin that was so well done, I wanted twice as much. The wine list was the size of a Harry Potter book, and the prices reflected the size. The view is one of the best in the city looking out over Lake Union.I would have given them 5 stars but thought it was a little steep on items like drinks, the food was average for a $$$$. I totally enjoyed the opportunity to dine at Canlis, I feel like it's more of a 'something to say you experienced' vs somewhere you want to go somewhat often. I went there 2 times. 1st for my birthday, my husband took me here for dinner. I heard a lot about Canlis but his just proved it. The moment we arrived, the valet took our car without giving a ticket, then we check in with the hostess who wish me a happy birthday and start the 3 hours pampered meals experience. I have never ever had better service than Canlis here. Our server greet us with name all the time and wish me a happy birthday. She is very passion with my food preference (I couldn't decide between wagyu steak or scallop she then suggest me to have steak with scallop on the side which I passed and decided just go with steak).So we shared crab cake for appetizer which is just OK for me, I prefer ART at Four Seasons crab cake (the best crab cake I ever had)then my husband order lamb, I had the wagyu steak, both are nice and cook perfectly by the time we're done we both full and just order coffee but then our server bring us assorted mini dessert with candle and not just that Brian Canlis, the owner approach our table to wish me a happy birthday and offer us a tour of the property. So we went to the tour of the restaurant and back kitchen, private dining room, etc ..It was amazing and maybe the best dinner I ever had.Oh .. and by the time we're done, our car is already outside waiting .. I don't know how the valet did it, but they did it. Upon further review (by way of several other dining outings) I'm removing one star simply for a the fact that a) though a great dining experience, it fair just didn't match the hefty price tag and b) in no fault of it's own: equally outstanding meals can be had several other places in Seattle.There, happy Jenny? This place certainly lives up to my high expectations. &#160;As I pulled up to the restaurant, a nice valet guy offered to take my car, but did not hand me a claim ticket. &#160;When he said I didn't need one, I was a little caught off guard and unsure if this wasn't some sort of car heist. &#160;I was starving and running late, so I decided to go with the flow. &#160;As soon as I entered the restaurant, I could tell this was not your ordinary run of the mill place. &#160;Everyone was dressed up including the staff and the minimally elegant decor gave it a very nice ambience. &#160;The hostess led us to our table and I was more than pleased. &#160;The view was incredible! &#160;It was bright out when we arrived and darkness fell before we left, so we got to see the sunset and the city lights twinkling beneath the dark sky.I was eating with two of my friends who enjoy food just as much as I do. &#160;We decided to order one tasting menu with a few courses off the main menu and go at it family style. &#160;I'm sure this was unorthodox at such a fancy place, but we were dropping big bucks and didn't care. &#160;When we mentioned this style of dining to our waiter, he did not give us any hint of annoyance and was happy to oblige. &#160;Tasting menu:We started with an amuse bouche which was a cauliflower puree soup in a shot glass and some sort of crab mixture with wasabi infused fish eggs on top wrapped in a paper thin sheet of cucumber. &#160;The soup was really tasty, but the crab thing was just OK for me. &#160;It was a little on the salty side. &#160;Then came the asparagus with mussels. &#160;The mussel was cooked well, nice and tender, and the flavors of the dish complimented each other nicely. &#160;We also ordered the Canlis Prawns. &#160;The prawns were cooked perfectly, but it was nothing special.The yellow fin tuna with haricots vert was very fresh and light.The rabbit was prepared three ways, all of which where delicious. &#160;My favorite was the meatball preparation.Next came the lamb. &#160;I really dislike lamb but will taste it if it's on the table hoping that my taste buds will change my opinion on this tender meat. &#160;I still do not like lamb, but was able to swallow what was in my mouth, so it wasn't that bad.I could have passed on the dessert. &#160;We had the Brioche bread pudding (not very good, especially when we just had the bread pudding at matt's in the market the day before), malasadas (hawaiian doughnuts), and Chocolate Cappuccino sorbet which was the better of the three. &#160;They were nothing to rave about. &#160;Overall, the tasting menu was good, but nothing spectacular. &#160;I recommend trying the main entrees. &#160;Although, if you see something interesting on the tasting menu, they will create an entree portion for you. &#160;I saved the best dishes for last. &#160;The LOBSTER and the DUCK.  The lobster was grilled and was a tiny bit overcooked, but the flavors were absolutely delicious. &#160;The gnocci and oyster mushrooms that came on the plate was a nice addition to the yummy lobster meat. &#160;Now, the highlight of the night.........MUSCOVY DUCK! &#160;I've eaten at many michelin star rated restaurants and have been fortunate enough to eat at places owned by world renowned chefs, but not one has come close to making duck the way Canlis makes theirs. &#160;The waiter brings out the entire body of the duck before it goes back to the kitchen to be sliced and the aroma as it passes you by is heavenly. &#160;A few minutes later, it arrives back at your table sliced and arranged beautifully. &#160;I immediately noticed the herb crusted skin as I cut into my first piece. &#160;It was so crispy you hear it crackling as you run your knife through it. &#160;The fat has rendered down to the perfect amount and the meat was so juicy and succulent, you will think you died and gone to heaven. &#160;Hands down, the best duck I've ever eaten. The wait staff was extremely attentive. &#160;The glasses were never empty and your napkin is folded every time you return from the ladies room. &#160;Our plates and flatware was changed with every entree. &#160;Then when it was time to end the evening, to my surprise, our cars were waiting for us as we stepped out the front door. &#160;How the heck do they remember who's car belongs to whom and get the timing so right??This place was very expensive, but we did order a ton of food. &#160;The bill came out to a little less than $600 not including tip. &#160;If money is an issue, I would skip the tasting menu and just order the duck and lobster. &#160;Actually, the duck alone is worth making a trip out here. &#160;The only negative thing about this place is that it rests on the side of the highway, so If you miss it or decide not to slam on your breaks while going 50-60 mph and have the car behind you crash into your bumber, then you'll have to drive an extra 15-20 minutes to turn around and make it back to the restuarant. Good place to had dinner, but i came at the wrong day i guessed?? too much tables, so i had quite hard time getting up from my seat. foie gras : they have a god, minimalist presentation. you'd probably think it was a vegetable terrine at a first glance. taste not so spectacular, like i expected in my mind, but still who can say no to foie gras? maybe if i was a seared one, i'd ask for extra appetizer.the wagyu steak, i like my steak well done. this was my almost perfect kind of well done. the texture, the combination of the marinate, its just SUPERB!! no need to slice like you gonna kill it. the meat is -chewable soft-. i What else can I say. &#160;WOW....Service is impeccable, food is top-notch, I mean...they IRON THE NAPKINS right on the tables to ensure crisp, clean delivery. &#160;Wait staff is unbelievably trained, wine pairings are informed and delightful.Don't leave without having a $12 cup of the Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee. &#160;It is one of the rarest coffees in the world, and Canlis tells a wonderful story of the coffee's history and the coffee's preparation process.You can't miss with the Canlis signature dishes...and take the time to review the history of the restaurant...it enhanced my meal. &#160;try to be at the restaurant at sunset...what a wonderful view!When I recommend, I RECOMMEND....don't miss this gem! Canlis is in a tie with El Gaucho as my favorite pair of restaurants in Seattle. Where El Gaucho is the old reliable stand by for well executed traditional classics, Canlis is the envelope pusher. The progression of Pacific Northwest ingredients and cooking techniques. It's actually very intriguing to learn about Canlis' culinary evolution when they started. Coming from a Broiler in Hawaii to the spectacular fine dining restaurant it is now, it seems like quite the journey. The first thing anyone will notice about Canlis is the amazing locale it inhabits in Queen Anne, overlooking Lake Union from atop of the hill. The entry has the rustic Northwest elements you'd expect; embedded stone, wooden columns/beams, and the surroundings of vegetation/trees. As you enter into the foyer and lounge, modern elements are brought in, sleek furniture and art, a very modern bar and intimately dim lighting. The main dining room carries minimalist booth seats and white linen tablecloths that open up to an array of large glass windows enveloping the whole eastern side of the building giving you unparalleled views of the city and the lake below. We were seated centrally between the sweeping glass views, the bar/lounge, and kitchen which provided excellent people watching for the night. Even though we were there on the late side, there were several large parties, a few special occasion diners, and families spread throughout. We were met with very polite servers and the sommelier, describing the various elements of each menu. Since the area boasted so many great ingredients, we tried to make it so that we touched upon the land, sea, and vegetation in &#160;a manner that we couldn't have back home. Dinner was as follows:-Pumpkin soup laced with vanilla browned butter-Crisped Foie Gras with a pear compote and a savory au jus syrup-Naturally raised, grain-fed, 21 day aged filet mignon served with cannellini bean pure&#233;, savory, roasted shallot and summer beans-Halibut - seared, with succotash, pickled radishes and daikon-Chocolate Covered Chocolate -molten chocolate cake, cocoa nib shortbread and chocolate-covered salted caramel ice cream -Apple Pie - cr&#232;me fra&#238;che and cinnamon As expected, everything was beautifully executed. This place would easily garner a Michelin star if not close to two if it were in NY or SF. On top of the food, they have an astounding wine collection of eighteen thousand bottles. Service was excellent. Refined, yet warm at the same time. You'd expect snooty at a place like this but everyone was completely affable. So much so they chatted with us for a quite a while and as the restaurant closed down, they took us on a tour of whole space, giving us the history and allowing us to see some of the special occasion rooms. The most interesting of those would be the "Cache" which is a mostly window facade, corner room, tucked up near the tree tops. It overlooks everything, providing one of the best views from the restaurant. With a foot in the past and with one ever moving forward, I'd consider it a quintessential Seattle fine dining destination and is spectacular in all counts. If they had a fan club, I would probably be president of it. &#160;I absolutely love Canlis. &#160;It truly lives up to all it is known for: Best valet in town (by the time you walk out of the place - everyone knows your name!), fantastic service, and delectable food. &#160;I enjoy the bar and enjoy eating and drinking in here for a very, very good reason: the pianist.When I dream of getting married, I dream of this pianist playing at my wedding. &#160;Not only is he very talented, he has a great variety of music he plays. &#160;Once, my date and I were here and basically stopped for a moment and though "what is this song...is it? No - really?". &#160;It was Outkast - but played classically so you almost didn't recognize it. &#160;I've also heard him play chili peppers...you have to really listen though or you won't catch them! :)My next favorite thing is dessert. &#160;They have this chocolate, chocolate, double chocolate dessert that is my favorite in town. &#160;I've had a lot of desserts, and it is heavy on the chocolate - so be prepared, but it is amazing.Throw on a dress, pull up your fancy pants and enjoy this Seattle gem. &#160;It's worth every dollar. I usually find myself waking up on a Saturday with 10-13 places in my queue to review from the past week and start knocking out reviews. Usually when I start them during the week I just enter random text, like "dfdggd", and save it to be reviewed for later. For Canlis I saved one word - "epic". I was lucky enough to get to go to Canlis with the amazing Susan S. and Vanessa H. and on top of that it was restaurant week! The two worst things that happened that night were them still steaming the tablecloth as we were being seated and confusing who ordered which tea. And I did find it a bit tacky to charge for the valet after we spent so much on dinner. But basically the night was perfect. Since there were two choices for each of the restaurant week courses we ordered everything on the restaurant week menu and then proceeded to order a bunch of items off the regular menu and shared all of it. It's a long list of stuff so here goes nothing... Appetizers - amuse bouche gazpacho - cauliflower &amp; crab soup - Canlis salad - steak tartare Small Plates - twice-baked potato - truffle fries Entrees/Small Plates - lamb with handmade fettucini - halibut - nettle tortellini Dessert - rhubarb shortcake - creme brulee - chocolate covered chocolate with salted caramel ice cream I think we did the right thing sharing everything. I have to say that even though everything was great some of the plates I felt I enjoyed a lot more because I had a smaller portion. I think on my next excursion to Canlis I'll definitely order the tasting menu. The steak tartare, twice-baked potato, tortellini, and piping hot fries Mark Canlis personally had them bring us after our first order got cold were the highlights for me. Unlike some other reviewers I actually really liked the view. It's not quite the view at Palisade or like eating at a restaurant on the ocean in San Diego, but it had a charm all its own. Whereas Palisade feels separated from Seattle, the view at Canlis makes it feel like it is part of Seattle. And as a local family-run restaurant open for over 30 years it truly is part of the city. I can't say enough for how great the service was here. Everyone was very friendly and made you feel like it was an honor to serve you. But as a warning to men reading this, when Mark Canlis comes around hide your women. He charmed me and I'm pretty sure Vanessa and Susan wanted to run off with him. I'm not going to try to tell people this place is for everyone; it is expensive. If you go just for the food itself I doubt you'll find it worth the price tag. But if you appreciate great food, friendly service, incredible cocktails, an awesome valet, a great view, and a locally owned and family-run restaurant you definitely need to check out Canlis. It will be a night you'll never forget. The only dinner that has made me as giddy as Canlis was Per Se, and that's saying a lot. I love this place. My review is based on a group event I attended:I was at Canlis for a networking event late last year. &#160;Our group was offered a great selection hors d'oeuvers. &#160;There were about 60 people in attendance, and the staff was fantastic about walking around the room throughout the night with food. &#160;We were in a pretty large banquet type room with a cool view.Unfortunately, the cash bar available for our party to use was extremely short staffed given the turnout. &#160;It was also located in towards the back of the lounge at a very narrow part of the room, making it nearly impossible to get a cocktail. &#160;I'm guessing the people in charge of organizing this event didn't let the restaurant know how many people to expect, because the staff seemed a little overwhelmed by the end of the evening (rightfully so). &#160;I think this is a great venue for group events if there is more staff on hand. I've only been to Canlis twice. &#160;The last time I went here, I told myself that I wont be going back. Yes, the experience was wonderful. &#160;Great service, ambience, and impeccable attention to detail. &#160;But, after a $320 check for two people the last time I was there, I have come up with the following conclusions:1. &#160;Everyone in Seattle should go here at least once. &#160;It is an experience.2. Way over priced. &#160;Yes, there are some amazing attributes to this place, but there are similar places in Seattle that come close for a fraction of the price.3. &#160;Great if your company is footing the bill. &#160;If you want to take a client out for dinner and want a quiet/good dinner. Great! Your guest will be happy and maybe impressed even.4. &#160;Canlis is over hyped. &#160;I remember having an amazing steak about three years ago (when they had an aging room). &#160;The last time I was there I was disappointed with my filet mignon. &#160;I can make it better (not an over statement).5. &#160;Boring food. &#160;Yes, they are classics, but no, it does not have the creativity that Seattle chefs are known for.Not for me thank you. &#160;However, Canlis is taking part in Seattle Restaurant week. &#160;Three course prix fixe menu for $25. &#160;Of course, the &#160;reservations for this tasting is full and so is the wait list. It sounds like a good deal though! Yes, it's probably the most expensive restaurant in the city of Seattle. &#160;And worth every penny. &#160;For every major event in your life - birthdays, anniversaries, promotions - Canlis is the place to make memories. &#160;We have been to nearly every nice restaurant in town over the last eight years, and unlike some others, Canlis hits its mark every single time. &#160; The food is divine (expertly prepared, perfectly sauced, just enough variety to make you think about trying something even while your memories of the classic Canlis dishes beckon). &#160;Presentation is lovely. &#160;Wine list is fantastic (fantastically long and fantastically expensive as well).There are other places to get great food in Seattle. &#160;What sets Canlis apart are ambience and service. &#160;People are actually dressed up! &#160;Where else can you find handsome men in jackets and ladies in dresses wearing jewelry and heels? &#160;The service is easy and attentive and unparalleled (hosts, waiters, sommeliers, and the unbelievably fast valets). &#160;There is a live piano player in the bar every night and he is amazing in breadth of repertoire. &#160;The interior has been updated but suggests a long luxurious history -- I feel like I'm living it up in Frank Sinatra's heydey, in a beautiful dining room with a Frank Lloyd Wright feel and panoramic views of Lake Union. &#160;Even the ladies' bathroom is pretty. &#160;If you really have some money to spend, splurge on the private dining room that seats up to 4 people. &#160;The service is amazing and the privacy is wonderful. &#160;Gets my vote as the absolutely best dining experience to be had in Seattle. This review is half a year late, but the summer tasting menu and sommelier pairings from 2009 will always be one of the best meals I have ever eaten in my life. &#160;Our server, Jonathan, provided some of the best service I have yet to receive, as did the sommelier, Phillip.One of the most amazing points of the night was witnessing my fellow diners eat dishes comprised of ingredients they had an aversion to, and sit chewing in awe-filled silence as they experienced the magic that is a talented chef expertly handling the product and their flavor profiles. I've been to many restaurants and I must say that Canlis is on the top of my favorites list.Canlis is simply amazing. &#160;It definitely has the wow factor going on here. &#160;The staff members are simply wonderful. &#160;When you pull up the valet as well as the person that greats you addresses you by your name. &#160;The staff checks up on you, not too frequently where it's annoying. &#160;The food is delightful - the lobster bisque (seasonal) and the mahi mahi are simply to die for. &#160;Ambiance and mood are great. &#160;Con - even though there are great big windows, you cannot see out because there's no lighting, thus no view. I first heard of Canlis from a professor at University of Washington's architecture school. At a review, he kept telling the wide-eyed undergrads "You have to go to Canlis and dine there and just look at it. Classic Northwest architecture. Atmosphere. Details. Experience." Perhaps not the most sensitive suggestion for a bunch of student-loan-budgeted undergraduates who aren't even old enough to do the classic Architourist move of having happy hour at the bar while gawking at the floor finish. But after dining at Canlis, I can understand why he was so passionate about the place, the space, the people, and the food. So, students, come here for your 21st birthdays. Or better yet get your families to treat you for graduation. Everything we consumed at Canlis was remarkable. The cocktail I ordered, l'Abbatoir d'Amour, was one of the best I've had in the Seattle region. A perfect blend of subtle, bitter, smooth. And praise to Canlis for using real cocktail glasses (thin!) and not martini glasses. My friend's cocktail was also superb. I would consider this one of the best bars in Seattle. Three of us shared two Restaurant Week menus to be able to try everything offered (amuse bouche gazpacho for each of us, cauliflower &amp; crab soup, Canlis salad, lamb with handmade fettucini, halibut, rhubarb shortcake, creme brulee) as well as some non-Restaurant Week offerings (steak tartare, nettle tortelloni, twice-baked potato, truffle fries, chocolate covered chocolate with salted caramel ice cream). Everything was perfectly composed both visually and in its flavor profile. If I went on about the details of each, this review would attain the length of a novel, so I'll just suggest you view my photos and attest that everything tasted as lovely as it looked. My favorites were the soup, the lamb &amp; fettucini, the steak tartare, and the rhubarb and chocolate desserts. One last food remark: THEY SERVE MARIAGE FR&#200;RES TEA HERE. If you are a tea freak, go go go go go. But you probably already know what I'm talking about anyway.I will return here before I make my way back east. Next time, the Muscovy Duck and Grand Marnier souffle.  &#160;The service here was impeccable, as it should be. It is truly remarkable when a place manages to be both precise yet unfussy, meticulous yet unpretentious, formal yet warm and friendly. We were greeted by owner Mark Canlis, who made the rounds of the dining room welcoming everyone and requested our perfect truffle fries be refreshed with a second, warm batch. &#160;Our reservation was at 5:30 and I'm glad it was early enough to dine bathed in natural light, enjoying the dramatic colors of our food against the view of the sun on the lake and foliage in the huge windows. I understand why people fall in love with the space. Why people get engaged here (If someone was going to go all uncreative with me and do it in a restaurant, this would be the ONE place.) Why architecture nerds palpitate at the sight. The details are as solid, perfect, and well composed as the food. The view of Gasworks Park and the lake and the Cascades is stunning. The mid-century building is elegant and rooted in its location. The pianist is hot, bears a striking resemblance to Adrian Grenier of "Entourage," and contributes immensely to the view when you are finding your way to the valet station.TIP: &#160;"Personal Request? No problem. Longing for a classic dish served in the past? Vegan, or five-course vegetarian tasting menu? Perhaps you'd like our pastry chef to personally bake you a specialty cake? Just say the magic word." &#160;Um... this means YOU CAN BRING YOUR VEGAN FRIENDS HERE. While visiting Seattle this past weekend, my wondeful friend treated me to dinner at Canlis. &#160;This restaurant is more than just the food; it's about the entire experience. &#160;I loved that my friend and I were seated on the same side of the table so we were facing the entire restaurant. &#160;We were able to see all of the action as well as the beautiful view of the city. To start with, I had the Pickett Salad. &#160;It is simply romaine hearts, blue cheese and a vinaigrette. Light and delicious! I paired this with a glass of Pinot Noir. Perfection.For my main dish, I had the Wild Nettle Ravioli. I hadn't heard of wild nettle before, but thought this dish was perfectly prepared. There weren't many ravioli, but the richness and ingredients were plenty to fill me. This is definitely the best ravioli I have ever had! For dessert, we shared the Mille Feuille-bananas, banana caramel and dark chocolate. Heaven in my mouth. It was absolutely delectable. There is a pianist that plays in the bar and what a lovely job he does. &#160;He played songs ranging from Frank Sinatra to Lady Gaga and Beyonce; all done in melodies. He was fantastic. Towards the end of our meal, Rick Canlis came over and introduced himself!!! My friend had told the restaurant when making reservations that I was visiting for the weekend and it was so nice that many of the staff members came up to welcome me. When I make it back to Seattle some day, I will definitely be going back to the Canlis. What an experience. I was waffling between three restaurants for fine dining in Seattle and I finally chose Canlis. &#160;I was unsure up to the point the cab rolled up the driveway into what looked like a luxurious sanctuary overlooking the water and parts of the gleaming city. &#160;I'm incredibly happy all the uncertainty was dashed and the evening surpassed everything I had envisioned.Tunes: Not only was the view soothing, their is an in house pianist rocking out all night and he takes requests. &#160;I love live music. &#160;Pick of bread: Potato roll or French. &#160;Both are excellent. &#160;Not sure what the ala carte is all about, we just wanted to be waited on and served. Canlis delivered time and time again. &#160;The food was elegant, fresh, balanced &amp; fragrant. &#160;Paid the extra for the Sommelier Tasting Flight, well chosen wines which only enhanced the food. &#160;Amuse BoucheGrilled cheese and a tomato gazpacho. &#160;The gazpacho was actually good and the grilled cheese had the perfect texture and a basil leaf. &#160;CapreseDeconstructed tomato, mozzarella and basil, loved the saltiness of the tobikoProsciuttoCantaloupe, figs &amp; fennel, lovely contrast of two preparations of the cured meat.ChickenCelery, porcini and black summer truffles, so buttery and earthy w/crisp skin.LambBaba ghanoush, ras el hanout and sheep's milk yogurt, exotic unexpected twist.Ginger BeerBerries and garden flowers, so clever to put a local beer to jazz up a typical predessert.Panna CottaGoat yogurt, strawberries, anise hyssop and yuzu, wow this was good, under the layer of goat yogurt was a layer of cake. &#160;Utterly blissful. &#160;Petit FoursEXCELLENT. &#160;One of the best bites of sweets I've had and I've had A LOT. &#160;Even the candies in the lobby were good: hard espresso. &#160;Phenomenal overall experience I would recommend to locals and visitors alike. &#160;A gem and just a stone's throw from Downtown, our cab ride was about $10. I can understand why everyone gives it 5 stars, but it's really closer to 4.25 stars. Definitely a nice restaurant for special occasions, but a few things could have been better.Food: Tasting menu was great and wine pairing was spot on, but portions were on the smaller side and pours could have been a little heavier. I eat a lot though, so for most people the portion probably would have been just right. One other minor complaint, for Seattle you would think there would be some seafood on the tasting menu, but none, which is weird. If I came back I would order an entree instead.Ambiance: Great view and cool architecture. My friends and I did get Pretty Womaned, you will get judged if you come in under dressed. We were all wearing jeans and none of the guys had jackets. Jackets are required if you sit on the lower leve. The maiter'd was cool and hooked us up with jackets.Service: Very quick service and presentation was done well. They were great about substituting for certain dietary resctrictions also. Our servers were really friendly and our waters were always full.Price: A little under $900 including tip for four people all doing tasting menu with wine pairing. &#160;So not a good deal, but could have been worse.Overall: I'm not from Seattle, but if you're looking for a romantic or special occasion restaurant and price isn't an issue, Canlis is cool. This place is AWESOME! My favorite restaurant of all time in Seattle. It's really romantic and the view is unbeatable. Definitely a great spot to go to if you're looking for a romantic place to dine with your significant other. It's definitely not cheap so it's not an everyday "let's go get some dinner at Canlis" unless you're a baller and you don't mind throwing down a few benji's. They're pretty strict on the dress code as well, men all have to wear a sports jacket and if you don't have one then they provide you with one. Pretty awesome huh?I've been here twice already and the second time was last month when I was back home visiting. &#160;We started our night with a few appetizers:Prawns in red chilies &amp; limes - $18: Ohh yummy, I love prawns so if it's cooked with any spices then I'm game. It was a bit pricey for 4 prawns.Braised Veal Cheek w/ onion, lemon confit and shiitake mushrooms - $18: I wasn't a huge fan of the braised veal but the bf loved it and he pretty much ate most of it.After inhaling our appetizers, we decided to order our entrees, I started with the Halibut, seared, with artichoke tomato confit and piquillo peppers - $38: The halibut was cooked to perfection and flaked off as I poked at it with my fork. I wasn't a huge fan of the artichoke tomato confit but it was pretty light and not too heavy which brought out the buttery flavors of the fish and peppers.Wagyu Tenderloin Kobe-style beef, &#160;Served with soy Madeira mushrooms and port reduction $68 - The waiter told us that the wagyu was a mix of a japanese kobe cow and an angus cow which sounded pretty cool. The beef was succulent and super tender and it melted in our mouths. It's probably one of the best meats I've had in a long time so it was definitely worth forking over $70 for.Did I mention that I love this place? The ambience, the view, the service and best of all the delicious food! This is my first time visiting a fine dining restaurant in Seattle. The place was quite cozy. the staffs were very friendly and polite. The food quality was pretty nice. I like the view, basically from this restaurant you can see the view of downtown Seattle. you have to wear formal clothes hereRECOMMENDED!! I had my engagement dinner here in late Dec 2009 .My fiancee rented the small private room upstairs. &#160;The room had a sound system, a nice spotting scope to enjoy the view. &#160;The dinner service was good, but in all honesty our server's knowledge wasn't up to par.The food however, was just perfect. &#160;We had the Canlis salad, scallops, and truffle fries to start, the duck for dinner. &#160;The scallop was one of the best I ever had, so tender and flavorful with a complex but beautifully balanced sauce.The service tried to give us privacy, which is nice but anticipated timing a bit poorly and never had a chance to order coffee. Would have been nice to have a center piece at the table, afterall flowers always makesa room nicer and a tab of about $500 for an evening for two is still on the high side for a young couple. &#160;Still, a beautiful night with lovely food. What is the big deal with this place again? &#160;The view, ok. The impressive restaurant itself, ok. Super nice bathrooms. &#160;Nice waiters.The food? &#160;Eh. &#160;I LOVE risotto, so if I'm going to pay 35 bucks for risotto to be almost completely tasteless... it's going to make me super sad. &#160;I actually sent it back, which I felt really bad about, but it was just really not good. &#160;Note: &#160;I really don't remember the last time I ever sent food back - the risotto was THAT bland.The pate was eh ok as well. Maybe a little less than that. The waitress was super great, but the food just didn't do their reputation justice. &#160;It seems people really like this place for the experience, which I get. Yes free valet parking and VIP service. &#160;But gimmie GREAT food any day! In my humble opinion, Canlis is the best overall fine dining experience in Seattle. &#160;I have been to many of the others: El Gaucho, the Met, Daniel's, John Howie Steakhouse, Rover's, Six Seven, Barking Frog, Zoe, Ray's Boathouse, Morton's, Il Bistro, Le Gourmand, Waterfront Grill etc... etc....All those other places are really good in their own way, but Canlis is still the best overall combination of food quality, service quality, and ambiance. &#160;Other restaurants have come and gone, but Canlis has stayed a landmark dining experience in Seattle for decades because of the consistent quality experience you get each time you visit. So, there's a basic formula to "wow" people with service and they know it (even if they don't execute it well). &#160;The problem is this place is obviously a place to go to see people or to be seen. &#160;That means it draws big names. &#160;Good for them, but not as good for the no-name people out there. &#160;You see, in the restaurant business there are some customers that are "more important" to a place than others. &#160;Even if this doesn't seem like it is true, believe me, it is. &#160;What sets a place apart from the pack is the ability to not let it seem this way. &#160;Everyone should feel like they are the priority. &#160;Canlis hasn't figured this out. &#160;The service is excellent at some tables at the expense of others. &#160;Sometimes this is unavoidable but can be mitigated to a certain extent. &#160;I haven't seen any interest in ding so here.On top of that the food, while thoughtfully prepared, was lacking in actual taste. &#160;Not to say that it was offensive...far from it. &#160;Just incredibly boring. &#160;The wine list is impressive and deserving of their Grand Award. &#160;It is priced a little on the expensive side, although there are some excellent international choices which remain reasonable. &#160;If you can communicate effectively with the Sommelier you should be fine. &#160;Some amazing trophy bottles too, if you're into that. &#160;The Sommelier I encountered was knowledgeable and generally absent.All-in-all I'd have to say for $400 for 2 people for dinner, I felt incredibly disappointed. &#160;They are so close to having it right, but at that price, so close is really, really far away.The view is lovely, though. Amazing food in a classy setting with excellent service and wine list that is longer than you can imagine. Everything on the menu is delicious. Avoid the tasting menu with a large party as you may end up getting some 'not quite perfect temperature' food. If you enjoy James Bond, order their Vesper -- they home-make their Lillet in the old-school style and the end result is a great martini. I was in Seattle for a long weekend after a business trip and I wanted Seattle's finest and I got it here at Canlis! It was a 9:30pm reservation on holiday weekend Saturday and we were a little late in getting seated but the servers there made sure we had a drink and an appetizer if we wanted it (and it was on them). We finally got seated around 10pm and from there it was just a great dining experience. We started with the Dungeness Crab Cake, Carrot Soup, the Pickett Salad, an all natural Nebraska Filet, Copper River Salmon and then the Chocolate Covered Chocolate. Very much on par with some of the places here in Chicago that I love so much. I will make sure to visit Canlis next time I am thru Seattle! My fiance took me to Canlis for my birthday and I am just floored at how good everything was!~ &#160;We sat next to eachother and watched everyone else in the room watching us dine and drink our glasses of wine... The Canlis Prawns, I highly recommend (who knew prawns could be so tasty?), The Canlis Salad, Steak Tartare...I got the wild mushroom raviolis, which were a delight! ---And if you love mascarpone cheese, you will fall inlove with each bite. &#160;Hunny had the Wagyu tenderloin which he said was unbelievable and tender with the port reduction and soy madeira mushrooms. &#160;We finished off dinner with the sweet potato pie, which I also highly recommend.The valet story is true... You drop your car off, and although they don't hand you a ticket, they remember you and bring you your car as you walk out.Top notch service all the way around.Lucky, little me gets to dine there again next week so I'll update you again on Canlis Trip II This was my first time at Canlis, and I was simply delighted! We had a group of 11 to celebrate a special birthday. The waiters paid such careful attention to every detail: we were greeted with customized menus for our group which they removed the prices on our list so that our guests would not know how much we were spending; also, when taking a picture of our group, she was careful to remove a chair from obstructing our view and conscience of waiting for people in the background to walk by to create the perfect shot! Although we had just reserved a table but not rented the private dining room, we felt that they were very generous in not seating anyone else in our section, which was not necessary but greatly appreciated! There were several in our group with dietary constraints, and our menu was specially designed to accommodate everyone in our group. Everything was impeccably prepared, but we especially loved the truffle &amp; wild mushroom risotto and the creme brulee (which was perfectly prepared, though I would have preferred it without the accompanying raspberry sorbet). My group was not drinking, so I was sorely disappointed as to not be able to experience some of the exceptional wines on the list, but they were very kind to the nonalcoholic Navarro for our group (and this will definitely give me a good reason to go back!). The live pianist added wonderful atmosphere, and the general manager gave our group a tour of the restaurant at the conclusion of our meal. There is an intimate dining room for two up stairs which is perfect a date as well as a private dining area for a group - both with fantastic views of the lake and city. He told us a lot of special history about the restaurant and shared with us about some of the VIP's that have visited, then toured us through the kitchen so we could meet the chef. Can't wait to visit again! There are only a handful of restaurants that I could classify as spectacular. This one is perched at the top of that list. During a vaca to Seattle, LA and Vegas, we made a point of coming to Canlis. I had read something about them at some point and put them on my list of restaurants to try (despite that it was at the opposite side of the country). I chose well. This place is AMAZING. Though hard to find, it was worth the hunt. Even the valet parking is impressive: they don't give you a ticket here---they memorize your face to your car. Inside the restaurant---GORGEOUS. The restaurant hangs over the edge of a cliff that overlooks Seattle and the view is spectacular. While I cannot remember much about the overall decor, but I do recall the swinging doors that led to the kitchen were copper and shined like a brand new penny. I recall wanting them in my own house, but quickly dismissed that thought when I imagined cleaning them. I was also delighted with the spacing between tables. Oh how I abhor restaurants that pack you in like sardines and then charge you an arm and a leg to listen to your neighbor discuss their kid's soccer game. Our waiter was SUPERB, delightful really. We talked endlessly about all things food-related and it was very enjoyable. He told the chef about our conversation and the next thing you know, he was coming out to join us. We chatted with him quite a bit as well. And the food that followed....dreams are made of fare this fine. Unfortunately our trip to Seattle was MONTHS ago and for some reason my review is missing from Yelp (along with a handful of others from our trip). That's a tragedy really because I cannot remember all the dishes we had (the chef even sent out a few we did not order), but I do remember discussing our next trip to Seattle and how we would have to come here again. The restaurant made a real impression on both of us.The standout dish was a New Zealand lobster with this amazing sauce and peculiar (but delish) mushrooms. I was so full by the time I received it, I had to take the majority of it home. You know that feeling when you've gone a few steps past overeating? Gosh, I wish I could remember more. Regardless, I count it as the best lobster dish I've ever had anywhere....and I loooooove lobster. Maybe this is a blessing in disguise because if I remembered more about what exactly we ate, this review would take an hour to read. What I can tell you with absolute certainty is that it was also the best service I have ever experienced anywhere. Move over Disney and Four Seasons, there is another game in town that has perfected the art of service. In addition to this most wonderful dining experience, we were treated to a tour of the restaurant and even given a copy of the original menu. The menu had the most entertaining descriptions of the food items, like: this dish is low calorie for the ladies. Truly. I plan to have it matted and framed one of these days. They also gave us a beautiful book with gorgeous pictures of the restaurant and food. I've showed it to countless people. It is an excellent marketing piece (coming from someone who does marketing for a living). The topper though, in terms of service, was that while we were off taking the tour, the valet pulled our car up, turned on the seat warmers (it was a chilly night) and brought our takeaway bag, menu and book to the car for us. It really doesn't get any better than this. First of all, a remarkable space--simply beautiful. The service is sophisticated, yet approachable. But there were a few blemishes on our high expectations; courses sat on our table well after they were finished and our waiter seemed a bit discombobulated,in terms of organization, despite his mastery of the menu. The food was solid, but only a few dishes were truly memorable. If Michelin rated Seattle, Canlis would definitely have a star. And maybe two if they tightened ship. Tonight was our first time to Canlis. &#160;We were there to celebrate mom's birthday and take advantage of Seattle Restaurant Week deal. &#160; &#160;First of all, I have to give them 5 stars for their service and overall impression. &#160;All staffs there are friendly and attentive. &#160;We had a great time because the people who take restaurant business seriously and made us felt super important for a night.Now let's talk about food. &#160;Even though we all ordered from the tasting menu, I can't resist crab cake for appetizer and it didn't fail us. &#160;The cake is amazing, there's probably no bread added in the cake...it's the meatiest crab cake I've ever tried. &#160;For starter, I had the Smoke Cauliflower soup and Frank had the Caesar salad. &#160;I like my soup but I don't love it, it's missing the 'smoke' and 'cauliflower' that I was expecting. &#160;Salad was great, dressing was just the right amount and it wasn't too sour. &#160;I choose lamb ragu pasta for dinner and mom had halibut. &#160;Both of them were good but halibut was more memorable to me. &#160;Halibut were seared perfectly and crispy on the outside. &#160;along with the sauce, it was great. &#160;Lamb ragu with pasta was good but not as good as Barking Frog's and especially when BF offered a bigger portion :) Dessert: Rhubarb shortcake was a total let-down, it was dry and nothing impressive. &#160;Creme Brulee was good.Overall, great view of Lake union, service was superb, food was good but not the best (I am getting pickier everyday!). &#160;Good spot for showing off Seattle or impress your date. &#160;Valet parking and dress code is a must. &#160;But to be honest, their regular menu is over priced, I probably won't come back here unless there's another deal. &#160;And this restaurant doesn't have the type of food that we crave for. &#160;Just a little too pretentious...can't really relax in this environment and Frank and I are way past the years that we need to impress each other! lol. For the price we would've pay for the regular menu, I rather go to Barking Frog, Waterfront Seafood Grill, or save up for Rover's.P.S. for guys: You have to wear a jacket and can't take it off during dinner. &#160;Seriously, I saw a waiter asking a guy to put the jacket back on! I visited Canlis twice now, both times in the lounge upstairs. &#160;This is a fantastic venue for any event with amazing views and very nice aesthetic. &#160;The staff were very accommodating to me and amazingly the valet even remembered my car on sight even with so many people at the event. &#160;I only had hors d'oeuvres here, but they were all fantastic. &#160;Next on my list is to visit for dinner, for which I am extremely excited! Canlis still probably the best in fine dining in Seattle. The service and food are outstanding. Arrived a little early to have a drink in the bar and unwind a little from the work day before tucking in for dinner. Siri was our server and she was very knowledgeable about the food and preperation. They took good care of us and helped us pair starters with mains and wine. We had the Foie Gras and Crab Cakes as starters both of which were beautifully presented and had amazing flavor. For mains we had surf and turf or to be more accurate she had the steak and I had the lobster - the steak turned out to be a little over done so we had to send that back. The lobster was huge - and was delicious. Dessert - Chocolate by Chocalate is just too good to pass us. The new addition of the salted caramel covered chocolate pop is a wonderful contrast. Wrapped up with pot of Kona coffee that closed the evening perfectly. Canlis still amazing! I probably don't have too much to add given that this place is amazing and yelpers know it :) The ambiance...is amazing. They have a gorgeous view, and the decor is classy &amp; subtle. I think some of the artwork is Japanese-inspired, looked like it anyway. The lighting is just the right brightness - has that 'romantic' feel without you having to grope your way around. The service..also, impeccable. To the point of scariness, sometimes. I don't have much insulating fat on my body so I tend to be cold..anywhere..but our server noticed I was cold without me saying a word! All she did was bring over a nice shawl (100% wool) - really made me feel at home. Also, the server is at your table the minute you have finished your dish, to take it away. The sommelier is also very friendly, and will give you the perfect recommendation. He's easy to talk to, so you can ask all kinds of questions about the types of wine you like. The food...I saved this for last, because well, it is just spectacular. I suppose I have eaten higher quality cuisine at restaurants in Tokyo, but for a US restaurant, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say it's as good as it gets. (In fact I think the quality of food in Seattle in general is much much better than the rest of the continent. But I digress. ) Everything I've ordered here has been wonderful, especially the canlis salad, canlis prawns, lamb, and truffle fries. The amuse bouche is also delectable. &#160;(sorry for lack of details, i haven't been in a while and my memory fails me) But the one thing that really REALLY impressed me - they serve Mariage Freres tea!!! Have you ever been to really nice restaurants and was really happy with the food, until when you ordered your after-dinner coffee with that telling spot in the middle of the milk foam (automatic espresso machine-made) or tea-bag tea? Well, I get that disappointment all the time, but Canlis did not fail! When I requested tea for my after-dinner drink, our server brought a box full of leaf teas to our table - all Mariage Freres. If I remember correctly they were mostly green tea variants instead of the staple Mariage Freres flavors such as Marco Polo, but I was ecstatic nonetheless. My only complaint was that they used boiling water to brew my green tea so it tasted a bit on the bitter side (you need to use 90degree celsius water for green tea, otherwise the leaves get scalded and you end up with muddy, bitter tea).Oh, and the chocolate souffle for dessert was fantastic. So gentlemen, if you want to impress your ladies (or your gentlemen), do take them here. The dress code is dressy, but no jacket requirement, and casual chic is acceptable too.Did I mention the price is very reasonable?Bon apetit! 3 1/2. &#160;This is a beautiful restaurant with an incredible view. &#160;Also, a great reputation. &#160;This is fine dining and certainly a formal setting, as you might expect. &#160;We had the duck for two, prawn app, souffle dessert, bottle of red wine from Guardian called Gun Metal (local Woodinville wine maker). &#160;It was all very good and our server was great. &#160;I will just say with a grain of salt that for $400 there are many meals that are a much better value certainly. &#160;I don't mind spending the money for a great dinner or special occasion and that's why we went here to experience it. &#160;Go for yourself. &#160;However, other Seattle eateries will give you great food for a more modest price. 3.5 Stars Based solely on the Dollar to WOW Ratio. I have never had an issue paying for a fabulous meal and l will say that the meal itself was fantastic, just not $350 fantastic, had I paid around $200 for our meal this would be a 4.5-5 star review. Let's get to it! Food I chose the chef's tasting menu and my gf choose the oysters, Canlis Salad and the Grilled Lobster. The Tasting Menu was spot on at every turn, with the exception of 1 course, the sailfish was extremely salty and was more of an assault on the senses were as the rest of the meal was delicate and complex. The Amuse Bouche a Sun-choke soup w/ black truffle oil was a fantastic way to start the meal- delicate and earthy. The Sailfish tartare- GROSS Course 3 was a poached seafood dish w/ avocado, mango and lime gelee- each piece of seafood was perfectly tender and flavorful Course 4- BEST of the evening, Oxtail ravioli- al dente handmade pasta encasing a rich oxtail stuffing all swimming in the most perfect veal consomme with carrot, mushroom and veal bone marrow to accompany. Course 5- Venison in 2 styles- The rack was med-rare and juicy with a well complimenting sauce of berries and chocolate-Very tasty. The Venison sausage was overpowering and dry-OK Palate cleanser- Pear sorbet- light and refreshing Dessert- mint ice cream sandwich- beautiful presentation- lacking in flavor. The oysters(according to my gf) were not good and fishy The Canlis Salad- dressing was good, the coddled egg giving it great consistency. but it was just a salad The Lobster- Fork tender with out a hint of rubberiness. sweet and full of flavor Service Excellent service although a tad distant. I didn't feel like I could have a conversation with our waitress. She would check in on us and then disappear for 15 minutes. Ambiance Definitely a special occasion kind of place. A beautiful view of the city, a great pianist rocking the whole spectrum of music and a long dining experience that will ensure you plenty of face time with your significant other. Great experience, but just not my thing. I was originally going to write a 3 star review of this place because my first visit had numerous lapses in timing and inattentive service. &#160;The food was quite good, but I felt like I was held hostage for about three and a half hours, the majority of it waiting while staring at the window.I wrote them and received a personal response from the owner with a small incentive included to give them another chance. &#160;I visited again, and the service this time was quite prompt. &#160;The food is always quite good here, especially the presentation, which is superlative. &#160;However it is quite pricey.I would like to give them 5 stars based on the quality of the main courses and the service in my second visit, however first impressions do count and my first visit was somewhat disappointing. &#160;Overall though, you can expect to be treated very well here. I always question how to rate this type of restaurant. &#160;Food:Price - 2 stars. &#160;The apps were good, but the dishes were underwhelming for such a famous spot. &#160;I had the king salmon. &#160;It wasn't good. &#160;Also, I would have expected a daily menu, it appears to be standard.Service: 4 stars. &#160;Excellent, but slow. &#160;It took 2 hours to eat a 3 course meal and we told the guy we were in a rush. We went there for our anniversary. &#160;The service was excellent and the food was very good. Nothing amazing though, but very good.We ended up paying $130 per person.We will go back, maybe in 10 years for our next big anniversary. The boyfriend and I came here to celebrate my new job, our life in Seattle, and our upcoming move to San Francisco. &#160;We were placed at "Table 1" the famous Peter Canlis table. &#160;Fun, but we didn't get as nice of a view as we'd prefer.The service was amazing. &#160;When we got there, there were only a few other couples, so everyone had their own waiter/waitress to take care of them. &#160;We had Jackson. &#160;Now Jackson seemed a bit nervous when we started, but quickly got in the groove of things and was fantastic. &#160;He made sure that we were well taken care of throughout the night.We started the evening with cocktails. &#160;I'm not usually a cocktail girl, I enjoy wine more...but we opted for cocktails and I'm glad we did! &#160;I ordered some drink with bourbon and lots of juices (pineapple, orange, grenadine) and it was so tasty. &#160;The boyfriend got the Waggner Remix (scotch and orange, I think) and enjoyed it so much he ordered another one for "dessert."The boyfriend, on a suggestion, ordered the Peter Canlis prawns. &#160;We'd heard a lot of hype about it, so he wasn't sure what to think of it. &#160;We've been sorely disappointed by hype in the past. &#160;He took one bite of that and I asked him "so, is it as good as everyone says?" &#160;His response, "Actually....yes." &#160;He proceeded to declare it was the best prawns he's ever had, as it was cooked to perfection and you could just taste the quality. &#160;I'm allergic to prawns, so he rarely gets to eat them...so I was glad that he enjoyed them so much. &#160;He ordered the NY Strip and found it to be fantastic. &#160;It was delicious...however, I ordered the Wagyu Tenderloin and really there's no comparison. &#160;Best, melt in your mouth, steak ever...even with the foie gras butter on top. &#160;We also got a side of the twice baked potato and thought it was fantastic. &#160;Dessert consisted of the chocolate covered chocolate. So good, but so overwhelming full by the end of the evening!The best part of the evening? &#160;The telephone. &#160;One of the hosts came to greet us in our meal to make sure things were going well. &#160;Since we were sitting at Peter Canlis' table, there's a phone next to it. &#160;He dialed the front desk and had me talk to the hostess from my table. &#160;Later, the phone rings, and it's the front desk again checking in with us. &#160;It was silly and simple, but it definitely made the evening memorable and fun for us. Thanks Canlis for a fantastic Seattle sendoff. &#160;We'll be back to visit. Amazing restaurant! I couldn't find a single thing to complain about. Everything was impeccable from the view, the service, the food, atmosphere...I loved it! I've been to Canlis twice in the past two weeks. Once for a girls' night with the Restaurant Week promotion, and once for an anniversary dinner. They were both great visits, but for different reasons. First time: girls' night with the $25 tasting menu. I had the chilled crab and cauliflower soup, the halibut, and the shortcake - and cocktails. The cocktails were nice, well prepared, with wonderful huge ice cubes in the appropriate places. The tasting menu was an exceptional deal at $25, but would have been appropriate at a higher price point, too. The soup still sticks out in my mind, smoky and spicy but so beautifully white! The halibut was pleasantly crusty, perfectly cooked (not too raw, nor too done,) but the sauces with the halibut were over-strong. I'm not a dessert fan, so don't listen to my opinion on the shortcake. I didn't like it, but it's not the shortcake's fault.The second time: anniversary dinner with the stuff that caught my eye the first time around. More cocktails, this time with the Canlis salad, twice baked potato, steak tartare, crab cake, and Muscovy duck. The twice baked potato was excellent, though a bit confusing - more like mashed potato with cheese crust in a Staub cast iron pan - since I'm used to twice baked potatoes in their own skins. The steak tartare was nice, with lots of capers and some very crispy toast. The crab cake was good though not like my Platonic ideal of a crab cake - it was moist and crabby but not exceptionally crisp on the outside. The crab cake was garnished with a fresh pickle of granny smith apples, which was delightful. The Canlis salad had a nice bright dressing, and the herbs in the greens were pleasant bursts of flavor, but the salad was overdressed, something one of the girls at girls' night was saying as well. The duck was the only dish I didn't finish - it just didn't compare to the Peking duck I had in Beijing. The duck was pleasantly prepared, medium rare, with the correct seasoning to take away any gaminess, but the skin just wasn't as good as a good Peking duck. There was an unpleasant fattiness that I couldn't choke down, as a vegetarian who occasionally eats meat (mostly at very nice restaurants.)We were given the green gazpacho as an amuse bouche with both meals, which was bright green and exceptional, and some fluffy profiteroles to finish with both meals, as well. Elegant, delicious, and a great view! Definitely a splurge restaurant but well worth it. The staff is incredibly welcoming, kind, and attentive. The food is always good regardless of what you order. wow, this place was pretty amazing. &#160;we had a great view of the gasworks park and the piano player was playing awesome music. &#160;the service was phenomenal. &#160;we started with a plate of canlis shrimp which was in a lemony butter sauce, and a plate of pork belly. &#160;the sauce on the shrimp was great. &#160;the pork belly tasted like an extremely high end hot dog which was awesome, though its the first time i ever tried pork belly and dont have a frame of reference. &#160; we had a couple glasses of champagne with our appetizers.we ordered a really nice bottle of chardonnay from southern france for our entree of lobster, which we never order but thought a good chardonnay would pair nicely with the lobster. &#160; glad we did that because it was really great. &#160;the wine was called "clocher de preusse-chardonnay, la cuvee du president, limoux, 2006. &#160; the lobster came pre shelled so it wasnt messy. &#160;it had a nice buttery sauce with little mushrooms in it and there were about 10 pieces of gnocchi mixed in. &#160;the gnocchi was cooked perfectly.all in all, one of the best meals we have ever had. I've had so many hits and misses at this place throughout the years--but my last visit was uh-mazing. &#160;The views are uh-mazing. &#160;The foi was uh-mazing. &#160;I don't know if they got a new chef or what, but the menu seemed re-vamped and I was all over it. While recently reading my copy of Bourbon Dandy, I realized that, while I'd eaten there a few times over the years, my "K-Bar" list of bars I've visited still lacked an entry for the bar at Canlis, and I'd never sampled their new cocktail menu. &#160;With the stalwart aid of a couple thirsty friends, this was rectified last night.Frankly, I'd love Canlis regardless of the food and drinks, as long as it preserved that great Pacifica-style cantilevered structure, the fine stone and cedar decor, and the excellent view. &#160;But of course Canlis joints are renowned for their fine (and fairly pricey) food, and if that were not good enough, they've recently decided to put a renewed focus on upgrading their cocktail menu, under James Mac Williams. &#160;Even the ice has been thoroughly upgraded, filtered multiple times, frozen with a Cryovac process to minimize gases, thawed, and refrozen, and arriving in your Old Fashioned in a magnificent tiny ice berg lodged to the bottom of your chilled glass. &#160;I myself had an Our lady of Thermidor (strawberry infused vodka en sous vide, bitter lemon elixer, Champagne &amp; a dash of Campari) which was good, and the l'Abbatoir d'Amour, which was excellent. &#160;My friends were just as much impressed with their Manhattan and Old Fashioned.If you're ready to drop some significant cash for dinner, you can count on Canlis to get it right, and you'll appreciate the famous extra touches -- the servers ironing the table cloths, the valets having your car waiting when you leave without ever taking your name or number, and the other small things that have made them the James Beard runner up for best service in the country a couple times. And I was pleased to see the Canlis family still not only operating, but taking a very active role -- a few questions to my server about some of the more tiki elements of the old days prompted a nice visit from Mark Canlis.But even if you're on a tight budget you can still enjoy the decor -- you can do as we did this visit and just drop into the lounge for a couple cocktails. &#160;They are a bit pricey ($12 to $18 for our choices), and you'll want to be a at least moderately dressy, even in the lounge. &#160;But if you're in the mood for an upscale experience, Canlis delivers. Impeccable service-except the valet did something really strange to our parking brake. Went here for our anniversary, the view was the best part. Food great too, and couldn't have been treated better. It just wasn't the most amazing meal of my life. I'd rather go to Serafina or one of the other amazing restaurants in town. This place really is as good as it gets. I've eaten at some pretty fancy places around the world and this competes with the best of them. From the perfect valet service and coat check to the quiet elegance, wonderful view, pleasant piano and delicious food Canlis nails it in ever aspect. The crowd is a bit older, the conversations a bit hushed. It's very romantic but also good for a small family gathering but probably better to leave your kids at home. Did I say the view is spectacular? Great wine list too, if that's your thing. Plan to spend a couple hundred bucks but it's well worth it. You can check out the menu online. I can't wait to go back. If not the best, this is one of the best places to eat in Seattle. &#160;The views are amazing, great live piano music, and magical valets =). &#160;When you get there it is valet parking only, and they just park your car with out even giving you a ticket or taking your name. &#160;When you are done eating your car is just out there waiting for you, crazy. &#160;The food was sooo good. &#160;It is the only place in the Seattle area I have seen Waygu steak on the menu and in my opinion is by far better than any other type of steak. &#160;I can't even compare the steak houses I have eaten Waygu at with other steakhouses because it just wouldn't be fair. &#160;Also the service was great. Friendly, elegant atmosphere. Superb wine list. &#160;Impeccable service. To die for food. Hands down the best in Seattle. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. I have mixed feelings about Canlis. &#160;Just saying the name stirs up oohs and aahs because who doesn't look forward to an evening of top notch service and food? &#160;But this restaurant is always an option rather than the actual choice when it comes to fine dining and last weekend's dinner solidified this. &#160;My parents took my husband and I here for his birthday. &#160;The service was impeccable. &#160;The ambiance was stunning and I felt like a red carpet A-lister. &#160;It was nice to see people dressed up so it gets an extra star just for a dress code! &#160;Unfortunately, the food was boring. &#160;Good, but no wow factor. &#160;Husband and I order the two most expensive items on the menu - the wagyu beef and lobster. &#160;Both were just okay. &#160;I've had better versions of both. &#160;The best thing was actually the free item not on the menu - the complimentary celery root soup. &#160;It was liquid crack in a cup. &#160;The shortribs were velvety and buttery, but lacked some serious flavor because they were boneless and the bones are where the flavor comes from. &#160;If you want to feel like a VIP, come to Canlis, but if you want to eat to-die-for-amazing-can't-stop-talking-about-it food, then maybe you should consider twice. outstanding experience! worth every penny. The Ultimate 50's experience in Seattle... 60 years after the fact. The food has suffered the ensuing six decades, but the service and style has not.Having grown up in Seattle a little after its heyday, I remember when this was THE restaurant in town. Like, FANCY. So, of course, we never went there. Recently, I finally made it to celebrate the myth that was Canlis at a family occasion. It was pretty much exactly as I had imagined... with the exception of the food, which was subpar.The best part of Canlis is the service and the look. If you love 50's architecture... this is your place. You can imagine Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint dining here while on the run from some shady characters in a Hitchcock film. It is virtually immaculate. It WAS, however, the second most expensive meal I've ever had (next to Wolfgang Puck's Cut in Beverly Hills, where we dined across from George Clooney). I didn't expect a celebrity sighting on Queen Anne, but I did expect more from the copper-clad kitchen.What I did love, however, was the dress code. It totally keeps the screaming, spoiled rich kids out and the riff-raff looking good. In ultra-casual Seattle, it makes people rise to the occasion. This is not a bad thing. On our non-weekend night, it was mostly younger couples (under 30), business people of all ages, and couples over 60. All looking nicely turned out. Except... one guy wasn't wearing a blazer and and one who was in shirt sleeves. Hey, guys! You made me sit in a warmish room in a blazer. That wasn't fair.We asked the friendly host and hostess for a great table, got one, had a fantastic server (Hi, Linda!) and a cute, efficient young blonde who kept filling our waterglasses and serving us rolls.The affable Mark Canlis, a third generation Canlis, stopped by and introduced himself. A nice touch.The valet parking is added to your bill... it is a reasonable $5 and you don't need a ticket... they recognize you on your way out and get your car. There is a half-empty bar by the excellent pianist which can give you the ambience (if not the view) for a far more reasonable price.We went in spring, which means it was light all throughout dinner. I think this place would really rock in the dark.SO glad I went. Not sure if I'll become a regular, but am happy they're keeping a stylish Seattle tradition alive and well and that I got to finally experience it. Great Service, Great Atmosphere, Great Food. &#160;Why 3 stars?First off, the service was the best I've ever had. &#160;I never felt pressured, never felt rushed, and felt that everybody was there to help at every turn. &#160;I couldn't even make a trip to the bathroom without a staff member sliding my table out for easy access. &#160;I was also nice to not have to get a claim ticket from the Valet. &#160;They just recognize you and hustle to get your car. &#160;Service: &#160;A+Atmosphere: &#160;Really warm and elegant with a great view. &#160;Lighting was perfect, place is extremely clean. &#160;It was fun watching the staff clean crumbs off the tables, and use a cordless iron to make sure the linens were looking perfect for the next group of visitors. &#160;A+The Food: &#160;Here is why the restaurant gets 3 stars:The starter bread was really tasty, the starter soup was incredibly unique. &#160;It was cold, green colored, and served in a dish about 2x the size of a shot glass. &#160;This was one of the best tasting soups I've ever had. &#160;I'd have paid $14 for a bowl of it. &#160;We ordered the famous Canlis house salad, and both of us felt it was unique and tasted good, but we weren't falling all over ourselves about it. &#160;Our main dishes were the Halibut and Salmon. &#160;We wanted to have seafood, not steak simply because there are a handful of steakhouses we could have attended for 2/3rds the cost. &#160; Those meals were very tasty, but we both felt that the Lobster Shop in Tacoma on the water had superior tasting entree's for about half the cost. &#160;The other problem was the portions. &#160;I realize a top notch restaurant isn't going to have a claim-jumper type platter with enough food to feed a village, but the portions are too small for the price being paid.Really great food, but not the best out there, plus portion sizes that are too small yet with the highest pricetag results in 3 stars, but I'm still glad we went. If you go, do it with realistic expectations. This was the first place we went to check out a great Seattle restaurant after moving here from NYC. &#160;The service was perfect and the surroundings were gorgeous, including the great Lake Union view. &#160;The food was really amazing, and it could match up with New York dining easily. &#160;The cocktail menu was great and the wines were incredible, too. &#160;Will be back as soon as we can! Our dear friends took us here for a special birthday dinner. The architecture and view (what bits we could see) were lovely. The food was rich and delish but not worth the price. We had some yummy little rich buttery soupy thing. A great salad and crab cakes for appetizers and then I had the Lobster and my peeps had beef. All very tasty. The service was not the best. We had to wait quite awhile for our reserved table, for drinks, for our order to be taken, for dirty plates to be cleared, etc. A mix up with wine glasses. Little things, that I would expect to be impeccable with this level of dining. The wine menu was out of control- a 10 lb book, pages and pages. The wine guy was very helpful and good with my jokes. Our waitress was friendly and informative but liked to talk about herself. My favorite part was when a group of servers would come out, each carrying a plate to be systematically, choreographically placed in front of a guest. They were like syncopated swimmers. Was a bit creepy when it was our turn. The history, pretty cool. What else?...Um, the bill...Left us feeling very very guilty.
The Sushi here is awesome. It is the best I have had in Seattle. I recommend sitting at the sushi bar and talking to the sushi masters. These guys have been trained for years in the art of sushi preparation and have interesting stories to tell if you are willing to talk to them. I also want to recommend that you request real wasabi. They charge more for it, but the difference between what most places give you and the real stuff is huge. Great sushi, really nice environment and interesting chefs to speak with. I highly recommend it. One caveat: it is a bit on the expensive side, so you should be prepared to spend around $50 for a good meal. But well worth it. This restaurant boasts extremely delicious sushi and excellent service. &#160;I think that their prices are too high. &#160;The high prices do not seem to slow down business--my experience has been that you need to make a reservation to eat here...I am now questioning the wisdom of writing a review that might cause MORE people to go here... This is definitely one of the best sushi place in Seattle. We went there for 25 for $25 event, she had the plate of various rolls &amp; nigiri sushi, I had a dish called the Dynamite, outside of the 25 menu. The sushi was very fresh, fish was smooth like butta' . I definitely like it a lot, even the vegetarian roll was very well made, fresh and tastes great. Dynamite is a mix of Scallop, Geoduck and mushroom soaked in broth, topped with some cream in a gratin dish. This was pretty rich, but it goes great with some steamed rice. I would definitely recommend Nishino to anybody. Prices are just about what you'd expect for a sushi place. We had Oyster on half shell appetizer - $8. My dynamite dish is $12It's not overly expensive, I would say it's fair for the quality we're getting. I am spoiled. &#160;I live in San Francisco, where very good sushi is as ubiquitious as a good burrito. &#160;In Seattle, visiting my friend who just moved here, we decided to scour yelp, friends brains, and other sources to try and find some really good sush. &#160;This place came up a few times, so we decided to give it a try.The foie gras that Erin V. would commit "heinous crimes" for, was BURNED, and FLAVORLESS, and the sauce was thin and pretty meaningless. &#160;Seriously, for $14.50, i would have rather eaten 2 california rolls. &#160;The uni was the highlight for me - fresh, delicious, excellent. &#160;While the sashimi was fresh, and the other sushi items on par with decent places elsewhere, the uni was really above average. &#160;Uni is generally the barometer for me, but in the case of Nishimo, it was unfortunately NOT a very good indicator of overall tastiness. &#160;For the price (I admit, my buddy paid so I can't complain), i'd get a burrito and a bottle of veuve clicquot Definitely the best sushi in Washington state. I visited during the 25 for $25 special, a three course meal for $25. The menu was limited for this, but for the price you can't go wrong. We made reservations hours before as I had been told the place was popular and not very large (but I spaced at making reservations earlier). We ended up being about a half hour early to our reservation but it still only took them 5 minutes to seat us (pretty good since we were there around peak dining time!), probably would have been impossible to sit at the sushi bar though...For the appetizer I had crab cakes, which were lightly fried and had a great flavor. My main course was the cod marinated in miso, which was perhaps to die for. I hadn't had fish cooked this way since I'd been living in Japan; it was delicate and flaky with a really great flavor. Dessert was another choice, I went with their home-made sorbets - mango, raspberry, and shiso (if I remember correctly). I had forgotten that I really don't like shiso (a Japanese mint leaf, sometimes found with tuna sushi) but the sorbets were delicious.In addition to the fixed courses, we had also ordered a few pieces of sushi. Everything came out perfectly - the rice was seasoned well, and the fish was fresh and delicious.We also had great service, a rather knowledgeable server who was really attentive and ready to offer suggestions. The restaraunt itself has a really nice atmosphere - not too crowded or dark. Definitely have to do the Omakase dinner. &#160;It is Chef's choice of a 5 course dinner (or 7 if you pay a little more) that is out of this world. &#160;The price is very reasonable for both quality and quanity of food ($55 for 5 course Omakase). &#160;You need to call at least 24 hours ahead and let them know of any food allergies that you have so they will avoid using those items in the dinner. &#160;My absolute two favorite things that was part of the Omakase dinner were the halibut cheeks (it melted in my mouth) and the mushroom soup that was delivered in individual tea kettles. &#160;The food presentation is artsy, which enhances the entire experience.In my opinion, this is the best Japanese restaurant in town. There is a starter on the Nishino menu that I would commit crimes for.Heinous crimes.It's that good.A shitake mushroom cap, perfect tuna, seared foie gras, and a red wine reduction. Two mouthfuls of bliss. This is one of the most well-executed examples of fusion that I can imagine. The sushi is impeccable, and there are many other lovely and delicious dishes on the menu - all well worth trying. Great sake selection, and a Pearl Martini that should not be missed. Nice service, but it is definitely crowded - and the last time I visited, the dining room was far too warm to be comfortable....But that amazing appetizer is what lingers. Make reservations. Dress lightly. And consider having a criminal defense attorney on retainer - just in case. This was one of the best meals I've ever had. &#160;Not to mention, it's the best bang for your buck if you're planning on spending some money anyway. &#160;Their deluxe omakase meal (at least when I went), was $65. &#160;Think now...for the cheapest omikase meal at Nobu, it's $80. &#160;This one had 9 courses, and was served by an impeccable staff that timed the courses perfectly. The sake cup was never empty, the sake selected for us (on the budget we requested) was excellent, and it complemented the dishes very well. &#160;Do make reservations, as it was crowded, but crowds mean fresh food, and keeping the place in business.It was excellent dining in Seattle, and I'm comparing this to a few places that always get super high ratings. I have to go with Rick on this one. It's good, but not "oh my god there's a party in my mouth and the entire world is invited" good. Plus, they do foie gras which I am, like, totally against. Force fed duck liver in a sushi place? WTF? I came here with a group of people, some of whom knew how to order from this place. Apparently it's an art and you need to get it right. This is my second WTF moment with this place -- if you're in the in-crowd you're OK and get decent food, but if you're just out to have dinner you're screwed? What we had was quite nice, but at about $80 a head by the time we were through, I would rather have had a couple of sushi meals at lower end places. &#160;They are pretty militant about their seating policy too. They have scheduled seatings for dinner, and you had better book. Seaweed Salad - OK. &#160;A weird mix of 3 different kinds. &#160;And $8? &#160;Ouch.Soup - Mushroom clam miso sounded like a great idea, but after a few sips I wanted to put it through a stainer and drink it plain.Osyters - Mediocre. &#160;That's really all I can say.Saki - good, but $16 for a small bottle? &#160;Also, it was served in a clay (not ceramic) jar, causing it to go cold after 15 minutes.Granted I was in a weird mood, but at a good Japanese restaurant you expect more hits than misses. &#160;Based on the other reviews here, it sounds like if you don't go for the 5 course Omakasse you're in for a let-down in term of quality and a big hit on the wallet. Definitely one of the top Sushi restaurants in the United States. NOTE: this is not a cheap place (some Yelpers who reviewed Nishino before me were bitchin' heavily about the price.. from their reviews it was clear they had no idea what to order..). If your main agenda is to save money from food, go to Dennis or something!However, an experienced connoisseur of Japanese cuisine that is not freaking out about their financial situation and is more concerned with getting supreme ingredient quality, virtuoso culinary art, and prompt &amp; friendly service, will know how to appreciate this restaurant. The chefs are experienced and originally from Japan (our chef was from Kyoto)- they are very kind and friendly to newcomers. If we get a chance to visit Seattle again, this will be one of our top dinning choices!PS. I am really surprised by some of the negative reviews of Nishino. You guys should understand- this place is definitely not for just anyone. I can only say one thing: through the prism of being a Los Angelino. if Nishino was here, in Los Angeles, it would have definitely got a full 5 stars rating (average). For some reason that I find hard to comprehend, this restaurant of of high-end taste is not fully appreciated and accepted in Seattle... Is Sushi an acquired taste to most of you?
I recant my last review. It must have just been an "off" night, because I ate there this evening and while yes they have raised the price, and the portions have gotten a wee bit smaller, it is every bit as delicious as the first time I ate there.This evening I took my mother there for Mother's day and we found out upon arrival that there was a private party, but that we were welcome to eat at the bar. I am not that picky, so that didn't bother me in the least. The party turned out to be a party for 2 twin 18 day old baby girls. They were darling dressed in pink and white ruffles, and the place was just so fun and festive. I loved being a fly on the way for a gathering such as this!Anyway, the food was diving. I had enough to fill me up and then have leftovers for later. The service was friendly as always. I have eaten a lot of Ethiopian in the past year and I still say this is the best I have had thus far. I even have dinner plans there on Tuesday next week! I have to agree with the more recent reviews. I've been back a few times and the food and service has been really hit or miss. &#160;I did notice the portions getting smaller and my favorite dish, the green chicken, didn't taste as good as I remember. &#160;But, the real downer is the service can be really great one day and lousy the next time. On one of my bad days, I had gone there with a few friends and it seems the further away you are from the kitchen, the slower it is to a) get your food and b) get any replenishing of water. &#160;I didn't get it because with the exception of the folks around the bar, we were the ONLY group sitting at a table that day for lunch. Also, when we had asked for plates (since we were sharing), it was like we had asked for a huge favor. I should really downgrade to 3 stars, but will give them the benefit of the doubt for now. &#160;I will update my review accordingly since I go there quite frequently. This place is fun! Music, people, great food and lots of options. Went here the first time for a birthday party and it was great. Slow service, but such is the Ethiopian style, it's all about socializing with your pals. Ordered the green chicken, and the bread stuff is gluten free.Prices are decent, people are cool. I'll return. Ambience lost them a star. Decided to try this restaurant out since 1) I live fairly close, 2) I bought a certificate on http://www.restaurant.com.Pros: I loved the laid-back atmosphere and how spacious the restaurant is. The food (we ordered 3 entrees -- chicken, beef, and lamb) was very delicious but a bit too spicy for me. Ample parking outside, very easy to find.Cons: It took almost an HOUR for our food to be ready. I wasn't in a hurry so it didn't matter much, but my boyfriend was getting a bit impatient because he was starving. Even after we were done eating, it took another 10 minutes for them to bring me my check, and another 20 minutes for them to figure out how to apply my certificate to the bill. What was supposed to be a quick dinner in the neighborhood turned into 2 hours of waiting/eating/waiting. I really wanted to give Lucy a good review, but I can't. Two stars is generous. The layout is nice, the atmosphere cozy, seating pleasant, and the service is speedier than average for an Ethiopian joint. And I really appreciate a glass of good tej. &#160;But I've been noshing on Ethiopian food for 30+ years across the globe, and over several visits, Lucy's food is barely mediocre. That trumps everything else.This last visit, the food was truly awful. The meat combo is a mess of indistinguishable hint-o-berebere Ragu sauces. The kitfo came raw as it should, but had no spices or butter, and tasted like it'd been spooned out of a safeway hamburger package. &#160;The gored gored didn't have discernible meat in it. The doro wat didn't seem to have any doro in the wat. Wat? &#160;At least the veg tikil gomen and gomen besiga were slushy but edible. Yeah, the whole thing was thoroughly disappointing. I suppose some folks would like this place, and the Zilzil tibs served to the Ethiopian couple across from us looked and smelled delicious. Too bad we didn't get any, even though a little was supposed to be on the combo. &#160;(Am I just too white to get good food here?) Oh, and the happy hour menu is fries and mcnuggets. Seriously. &#160;Ew.With one of the best Ethiopian restaurants in the city just a short drive north to135th (see my review of Gojo Ethiopian), and a whole bunch of better options in the Central District, there's no reason to suffer thru Lucy. We went back for dinner and noted the same changes as Marissa S. Definitely smaller portions. The injera in the entree was cold and stiff where there was no food piled on top, while the injera on the side was slightly better (but still mostly cold) . What's up with that?I don't recall any price changes though.We'll be moving on from this place. Bummer because they are close! Lucy is in the Oaktree Cinema complex, on the opposite side of the IHOP. Ethiopian is one of my favorites to go out for. There's now a really good restaurant that people in the north end of Seattle don't have to drive to the CD for. My mom and I got the meat/veggie combo, with a beef sambusa to start. Some may not like that the service is a little slower, but this is something I have experienced at all Ethiopian restaurants I've been to- the emphasis is on talking with your dining partner(s), from what I've noticed. I'm not sure if the injera here is 100% teff, but my mom, who reacts to gluten, didn't notice any after effects. Lucy, as well as Habesha close to REI, has much more of an upscale feel. The food was awesome, and varied: two types of lamb, ground and stewed beef, lentils, split peas, and a stewed carrot/sweat potato dish I had never had- there was a little spice to cut through what could have been otherwise a very sweet dish. We were also given a caraffe of water- I hate having to flag down someone for water, so this was a bonus for me. Sambusa, coffee, and the two combination were just under 30 dollars. Between the two of us, we ate what three or four normal people would have tucked away (don't judge... we were hungry!), and there were still leftovers. Raw, raw, raw. Yes, back for the kitfo as promised. Not cooked. Raw. I've repeated it about as many times as I had to in order to reassure the waitress that yes, I wanted it raw. As in uncooked. I suspect that not many non-Ethiopian patrons go for this option, based on her persistent clarification....Rrrawrrr! A lovely chile-red, warmly spiced mound of meaty goodness. The kitfo arrives heaped in a serving dish, accompanied by a smaller dish of Ethiopian cheese (think very mild, with a chevre-like consistency) mixed with herbs. What beautiful alternating mouthfuls: injera and cheese, injera and kitfo, with spices and smoothness and sweetness and sponginess all melding into a truly simple yet irresistible food experience.Since this was my kitfo-cherry-poppin' dinner, I haven't much to compare it to. So I'll be excited to try it again...since we all know the first time is never the best. I was impressed as this is the nicest Ethiopian restaurant I've been to. Great tables and booths, good lighting (I guess I am a sucker for lighting since I always mention it in my reviews), and non-tacky decor. I hadn't had Ethiopian in a while so I forgot how much food you get! Definitely enough to share with someone. I cannot remember the name of what I had which sucks, but it was a spicy beef dish that did not disappoint. Everything looked really good, especially the vegetarian combo platter which is probably what I will try next because I WILL be going back! I love Lucy.I have only been here once but I shared the veggie combo and STILL had enough to take home. Which, although still full from the night before, I promptly ate for lunch the next day. The injera is great and I didn't find it too spicy (LOVE spicy!)...except maybe the one red dish in the middle. I have no idea what the heck I was eating but it was good and since it's vegetarian, I didn't have to worry that it was something I'd be so horrified finding out that I ate it, I'd projectile vomit. The quick version: As a frequenter of many Ethiopian restaurants, this one is the best. Just go already. Or, read my review because it's interesting and stuff.Lucy was first discovered beneath the Ethiopian soil in 1974. Her brief life as a proto-human, even though she could walk upright, was probably lacking in perfectly-spiced food. The good news for Lucy is that her fossilized bones were destined to be unearthed and examined as the oldest living ancestor we humans can find.Of course, this isn't the pliocene, and when you're hungry in north Seattle, you aren't thinking about important paleontological finds. You're interested in good food, and that's what Lucy does best.I'm talking about Lucy Ethiopian Restaurant &amp; Lounge, the new and popular ethnic restaurant at the oak-tree strip mall. Let me tell you first that I'm no first-timer when it comes to East-African food. I lived right in the heart of Cherry Hill, Seattle's "Little Ethiopia" and have had the privilege to eat at several different places that offer Ethiopian, Eritrean, and Kenyan fare. The experience varies little between the central district locales, and I don't think standing out from one another was ever much of a goal. Some shine above the others, but none will let you down. Lucy isn't surrounded by competitors, it's surrounded by starbuck's and BURGERMASTER. When I entered, my eye caught the Mesobs with low-seated chairs. The place was nicely-lit, and had some nice East-African pop music softly playing. There's a TV on the wall playing some infomercials. It smelled great, and had all of the atmosphere of the more established places, even if you were aware of the strip-mallness of the location. Extra star for cleanliness of the dining room. We were directed to a cozy booth (one star already added for these cushy booths), and within 20 minutes had green chicken and a veggie combo presented at our table. It was very good! The spice combo was delicate yet came packing a nice amount of flavor. I was not weighed-down by the soupy food, despite the ridiculous amount that I managed to eat. I'd recommend grabbing a lunch here (buffet style for $8.99) or a long leisurely meal before a movie. Room for improvement: The tiramisu was pretty bad. I hope they can find a better supplier for this dish. Was in town for business and came to this place with a friend for the first time. &#160;I would've been happy just sitting there smelling the wonderful spices. &#160;I was greeted warmly and directed to a table.My friend and I each got a combination platter, which neither of us could finish -- a TON of food. &#160;We shared a tomato salad, which was good for my dish which had no vegetables (meat combination -I'm not complaining!). &#160;The salad was nothing to write home about, but a good balance for the spices.The meat combination was outstanding, with two exceptions -- one was a meat dish that is lightly/undercooked. &#160;I understand that is the way it is served, and I tried a bite, but really disliked it. &#160;The other dishes were phenomenal. &#160; Judging from my friend's plate as well, they seemed to have put the spiciest dish in the center of the plate. &#160;The heat was definitely there, which I like.The servers don't rush you, so it's a great place if you want a long, leisurely meal. &#160;The acoustics are a little challenging, so when noise picks up it can be a bit challenging to hear. &#160;We were there on a Sunday night and it looked like they were setting up for a dj or some other live music, which I can only imagine could overpower the place.A few things I wish had been different: our table wasn't clean when we sat down, and I had to ask to have it wiped -- and even then it was a pretty cursory job. &#160;I also wish that, as in other Ethiopian places I've been to, they would have offered us wet towels or wipes at the beginning and end of the meal.That aside, though, the food was truly amazing. &#160;I'm definitely going back next time I'm in Seattle. I missed the UYE on 1/23/2011. But, I've been craving for Ethiopian food since they posted the event. In addition, I really wanted to try this place since it was a few blocks away from where I live. Therefore, I went there with my sister. It looks like that Monday is a slow night. We walked in with only one table full of crews. The interior of the restaurant is very modern and the seating is very comfortable.We didn't know what to order. I was happy with the meat and veggie combo. The meat combo has I believe both beef and lamb. We pretty much ate everything in the meat combo. It was very yummy! We didn't finish the veggie combo. However, we really like the cabbage in the combo. Eating with fingers is always fun! I washed my hand a few time, but I can still smell the spices on my hands :-) Comparing with the one place I've always gone to, Lucy has more selections of food on the menu. When I first walked in to the space for dinner I thought, "I could definitely hang out here for a drink or two." The atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming and I loved the booths that make up most of the seating area! We ordered the meat and veggie combos and I have to say that there were dishes I liked more than others but none that I didn't like at all. We had plenty of leftovers to take home and I thought the inerja (bread) &#160;would turn into a soggy mess but it held up remarkably well. I've only had Ethiopian food once before and while it was good I never really planned to return. After checking this place out I'm sure I'll be back. Oh my Goulash, this was good stuff! &#160;We got the veggie and meat combo plates to split between 3 people. &#160;There was a ton of food, and an excellent variety. &#160;I do have to say, it IS spicy like many have said. &#160;My son really couldn't eat too much of it, but he LOVED the injera. &#160;Speaking of injera, I was very impressed with the flavor and texture - it wasn't too spongy, and had very robust flavor. &#160;The service was awesome - such friendly staff. &#160;I really appreciated the warm colors in the restaurant, and the lighting was wonderful! &#160;All in all, I'd recommend this place to anyone who hasn't tried Ethiopian food before, but would also give a heads-up about the spice. I don't know Ethiopian food well but I like it and I thought the food was good here. &#160;Service was friendly. &#160;Minus of this place in my opinion is the night club decor (really dark shiny surfaces and big TV) that is culturally congruent but detracts from the experience if you are just having dinner.How to find: It's on the north side of middle out-building of the Oak Tree complex next to Aurora. &#160;If you can find the Starbucks, it's a few doors down. Since I reserve single-star reviews for the places that actually give me food poisoning, two will have to do. But two feels terribly kind for this place, which couldn't have been more disappointing. I'm a big fan of *good* Ethiopian, of which Seattle has more than one might expect, but this ain't it -- incompetently spiced and served cold. I'm interested that anyone here is complaining about small portions; I was glad there wasn't any more to choke down on that plate than there was. Service wasn't so hot either; definitely got the sense that I'd interrupted the waitstaff's soccer viewing, which was pretty much all I got from her; would have preferred, I don't know, a beverage or something useful like that. (So rude of me to come in during happy hour, I know.) I won't be back. Great Ethiopian food. I am vegetarian, live in the neighborhood and go frequently for take out. They are fast, very cordial, friendly and the food has always been good.The veggie combo in Ethiopian food is one of the most healthy, flavorful ways to eat vegetarian and they give you a TON of injera so lots for leftovers. It is a must go to! Decent and convenient Ethiopian food in my neighborhood. The atmosphere is good, food is fine but not fantastic. I'll be back, they are close. Delicious, vegetarian options, huge serving size, and good prices. &#160;Big time win! &#160;Carry out, or dine in the attractive and pleasant space with plenty of parking. Modern decor, great service, excellent food, we get the veggie combo too. Fun traditional basket tables available. Classy place. Terrific food. Once you get past the fact that it's in a strip mall on Aurora, the atmosphere inside is tasteful and pleasant. It's modern, warmly inviting and scrupulously clean. Service was prompt and attentive. Most importantly, it was &#160;some of the tastiest Ethiopian food I've had in a long while! Veggie combo and green chicken were enough to satisfy a family of four (including a typically picky eater). If one was dining with an outrageously non-adventurous eater, they do have a spaghetti entree available as an alternative. Great prices too. Why would anyone eat fast food when you could come here and feed four, with gracious table service for $24 (plus tip). Hope they make it. They've been open only a few months and from the empty tables, have yet to be discovered. Finally, good Ethiopian food returns to North Seattle!Having been to Ethiopia twice, I'm going to feign authority here and call this the most authentic cuisine in Seattle. The food is savory, spicy, and not overly oily. The injera is perfect. It's probably the only Ethiopian restaurant in town with good ambiance and comfortable seating, and the service is remarkably fast.I was very impressed with their meat dishes; they were spicy, but not oily. A lot of Ethiopian restaurants add too much niter kebbeh and wind up serving spiced Mazola -- same trick as Chinese places that add too much corn starch. Lucy gets the sauces right, however, and the results are *spectacular*.I look forward to trying their lunch buffet. I ate there for the first time today. I had the Green Chicken which was awesome and the Ye Beg Lega tibs. &#160;Had to eat that later because the Green Chicken was enough to fill my stomach. &#160;I had take out and sat at the bar while the food was being prepared. The service was good, the waitress asked if I wanted water while I waited. &#160;My second dish was equally good and I am sold on the Green Chicken.. although I would love to have a bit more greens and cornbread served with it. lol Best Ethiopian around. Not cheesy like most. Great, Authentic Ethiopian food, very pleasant servers, and beautiful decor! This was a great night out. &#160;We went here on a Wednesday and the place was pleasantly busy. &#160;The service was great and the food was delicious not to mention affordable. &#160;They also have a cool selection of Ethiopian beers. &#160;The owners were very nice and came over to make sure everything was going well half-way thru the meal. &#160;Overall, a great experience.
If you like import beers, this is THE place to go. AMAZING selection of both bottled beers, and drafts. But make sure you take a good look at the prices. It is NOT cheap. You might also be waiting awhile for another round, the service can be pretty slow. A great selection of beer, but the wait staff can be very slow or very rude, depending on who you get. Great place. Life music sometimes. It feels huge and kinda cold when it is empty, but when the crowds role in it makes for a great bar where you can hear your neighbors when they talk to you. The two floors make for plenty of sitting room. The beer selection is really not to be beat. Each beer comes in its designated glass - some can be pricey so check the list before ordering. (Great staff as well!)
I was craving fried chicken, and low and behold in Pike Place, all of the sudden this place popped up! I was excited, everything looked so fried and greasy! YUM, exactly what I had been hoping for. The fried chicken drumstick was all I got. (After-all I do have to fit my wedding gown in 4 months). The fried part was the best part. Once I got into the chicken part, it wasn't as good and that kinda let me down. Oh well, at least I got my fried chicken fix met, and cheaply too. Fried chicken Liver and Gizzards.I will overdose on this stuff everytime I go to Seattle.'nuff said. Fried chicken livers and gizzards! &#160;Well seasoned bites of umami deliciousness in a bag. &#160;1/2 lb. is like $3.00, and more than plenty of goodness.Great snack to nosh on while perusing the rest of the market.Always a smile and friendly service here. I cannot go to Seattle and leave without a trip to the market for a bag of deep fried chicken gizzards. &#160;For less than $5 a pound, I ordered 2 pounds on my last visit for self-indulgence. &#160;I consumed the whole bag so fast that I almost couldn't eat anything else for the rest of the day and the next. &#160;However, it was well worth it! &#160;Like Tanya T, I can totally OD on them. Had the jumbo drumstick for $1.65. &#160;Was good, but not the best. &#160;Inside was hot and juicy, the outside could have been a little more crispy. &#160;I would probably try the regular drumstick next time. &#160;Still a good value.
If you're a vegetarian/vegan and you haven't tried Ethiopian food yet, go out and fix that now! Ethiopian is so great for vegetarians/vegans. It's cheap, plentiful, delicious, and you eat with your hands! I've tried many Ethiopian restaurants in Seattle, and Saba is one of the best for vegetarians/vegans. The Veggie Platter is HUGE (fed four of us) and is only $12 or $13. We also added the Shero Wat (a chickpea stew with Garlic and Onions), traditionally it's cooked with butter, but Saba also offers it with olive oil for people who don't eat dairy. It was a delicious meal. And we had plenty of leftovers. The waitress was great too! She brought us more injera without asking (at most places I've had to ask for more).Bottom line: Cheap and delicious food! I definitely recommend this place and I will be back. We went on Monday night, and by 6:30pm this place was packed with mostly locals. I think our table and another table were the only non-Ethiopians in the entire restaurant. The Ethiopian beer we got from the bar was interesting too! Now I can say I have tried beer from Africa.The wait staff was friendly, but not very attentive. It took us a long time just to get our order in and a long time to wait for the food. This place would definitely get 5 stars if the service was just a tad better, but since the food was delicious I would definitely go back. I got the spicy lamb tibs and my friends got the beef tibs and they were really good with generous portions. :) Delicious. Good sized portions. Friendly service. I definitely recommend this place.
I use to loved Grilled pork, but not anymore. &#160;Lately the gilled pork wasn't great, to dry and chewy, &#160;I don't know because meat cook and leave it to long and reheat. &#160;The daikon and carot pickle the taste so light. &#160;I know $2.50 cheap. My bahn mi was okay, but I wasn't really impressed with them putting their stockpiles of gallons/barrels of oil/grease in the front area for all the customers to see. ... Plus, after trying Paseo's, Tubs, and Salumi in Seattle, it was just hard to eat at Saigon Deli. They set the bar high. My favorite vietnamese spot. Don't go there as much as I'd like to, but I never have complaints. Love the sandwiches there especially when they are still warm! Need to hold on the mayo sometimes, but very yummy! Best to go right before it gets busy for lunch because most of the food is already made and is totally fresh. My one stop shop for vietnamese sandwiches, bun, fresh spring rolls, fried egg rolls and meat balls. There's also a whole ala carte deli I still haven't tried. Prices are great and the food is always fresh. I was once a Seattle Deli fan, but now after tasting the sandwiches here have been converted. There's a special sweet mayo sauce and the bbq is freshly grilled, not the dried thin stuff you get at other places. yum! cheap!i like to eat a little bit of everything so - variety!$10 would get you so much food you don't know what to do w/ yourself. my favorite is banh mi thit nuong but sometimes i like the ga (chicken) if i feel like it. other then the banh mi and the desserts/pastry stuff wrapped on the tables, i haven't had much else.my bf doesn't want to try the hot food there - he says it looks dirty &#160;LOL The only have take out service, but one of the cheapest/best Vietnamese sandwhich in town. &#160;I usually get the tofu or the chicken. &#160;The have a decent buffet which you'll have to just point unless you speak Vietnamese. &#160;I love the fried dough balls rolled in sesame seeds. &#160;Be adventurous and try one of their many cold prepared Vietnamese dishes. &#160;They have some bottled drinks in the coolers, but not a great selection. &#160;Parking is usually easy in the lot or just off 12th Ave. I know it's a bit like apples and mushrooms, and it won't be popular, but what do you think of this:a 'sandwich-off' between Paseo and Saigon Deli...........Paseo vs. Saigon Deli in a battle to the death sandwich-off............any takers? This is the first Vietnamese sandwich place I've been to in Northwest. I've had my fair share in LA, so I have certain expectations.As one of the reviewer mentioned, the sandwiches had a bit too much mayo for my taste, otherwise they were good. I loved the fact that the sandwiches were warm, which made the bread crusty and really elevated the experience.This will definitely be one of my standard go-to place for "fast food." I don't get that excited about Banh Mis anymore, but the sandwiches here were good. Hard to give extra stars for the price when all the other spots sell em for cheap too. Bread and toppings were good, slightly heavy on the mayo. I had the chicken (shredded) and it was OK, slightly sweet. I also tried the Xiu mai (meatball) which was probably a tad better. Grilled pork was like char siu, ok too. They have cheap lunch specials 2 items $4. Be forewarned though, there are no seats inside, strictly to go business. I wasn't thrilled to find that out on that cold winter day. What? &#160;Grilled pork sandwiches you say Yelpers? &#160;Ok, ok, I'm no banh mi expert, so I trust you guys! &#160;And grilled pork sandwiches it was that I ordered on a sunny Sunday afternoon before my occasional treat-meself trip to Trophy Cupcakes. &#160;Tucked somewhere in the Vietnamese area of the ID, you'll find this hole in the wall with limited parking space. &#160;Careful that you don't confuse it with New Saigon Deli though, further down. &#160;Upon first entering, it was somewhat of a mass confusion for me. &#160;What? &#160;No line? &#160;Are you in line? &#160;No..oh. Ok, I'll order 2 #1's please..and an iced Vietnamese coffee. &#160;Back to the waiting crowd. &#160;Ordering off the menu was easy as pie, no Vietnamese needed. &#160;5..6...7 minutes later, our sandwiches are done and we head back to eat them.Mmm! &#160;Yum! &#160;I only wish it were bigger b/c I wasn't full though. &#160;(Could be b/c I am eating for two...) &#160;I must have been too hungry but next time, I think I'll get two for myself. &#160;Bread was fresh and meat was tasty. &#160;While the coffee was good, strong but a bit sweeter than I liked, I won't be ordering that again. &#160;I had like 5 sips and it was gone. &#160;Way too much ice in it I tell ya. &#160;But thanks to Yelpers for all your insightful foodie reviews. &#160;I've found me another food diversion to sink my teeth into. All I have to say is, thank goodness! &#160;Now we don't have to move back to California. &#160;We found authentic Banh-Mi in Seattle! &#160;You don't know how happy this makes us. &#160;Hubby and I are HUGE fans and were sorely missing our Vietnamese sandwiches. &#160;We tried one place in Factoria which sucked so bad...omg, SO BAD! &#160;We were worried we wouldn't be able to find it here...then we found Saigon Deli. &#160;SO DELICIOUS and SO CHEAP! &#160;$2.50 for the everything sandwich. &#160;We found out about this place like a week ago and we've already been there twice...we live in Issaquah, people. &#160;This is major. &#160;I LOVE SAIGON DELI! If this is the best Banh Mi (Viet Sandwiches) in Seattle, I miss Bolsa (Little Saigon for those who don't know). I mean it wasn't bad. It's the best I've had in Seattle, but a far cry from Bolsa. This place would not survive in the OC but I guess it will do for now. You could do much worst. Trust me. I've eaten in those places. This is place is well worn and is the 'other' walk in joint for my quick fix. It has been my 'saving grace standby' if the Seattle Deli is too busy or out of pork bahn mi's. Whew- talk about an emergency once you have the craving and you are told they are out of pork!I feel that the meat is a lil more chewy here than I like, but not too bad..at least &#160;the buns are always toasty. Tip: they have a great deal on whole box meal of meat, veggies and rice for like $4 bucks that my hubby swears by!
I was supposed to meet somebody for dinner this past Friday, but was so hungry a couple hours beforehand, I had to have something to tide me over. &#160;Since it had been over a year since I had last been to Matt's - and a hot dog sounded just right - I pulled in.Everything seemed the same, including the welcome mat hung over a beam in the kitchen that simply said, "Hi, I'm Mat."Like previously, I ordered the Chicago hot dog. &#160;But this time around, the wiener was a much better quality. &#160;It also seems like it had grown in size! &#160;The chilled refreshing condiments that were added- diced white onion, relish, jalape&#241;os and mustard made this an absolutely delish dog! This is hot dog old style - natural casing, lots of 'snap,' great texture and taste. &#160;Matt's a charmer, and really knows his stuff when it comes to putting together the dogs and burgers. &#160;Chili dog is awesome, as is the Chicago dog, and the burgers are mighty fine too, but the star of the show is the slaw dog (chili, onions and coleslaw, just like you'd find down in West Virginiia or the Carolinas). &#160;I can also recommend the fries (plain or with chili and/or cheese) and the soda fountain style shakes. &#160;Not a lot of seats inside, but you can always opt to eat out on the picnic table. &#160; I've tried hot dogs from the sellers outside of Quest Field, and from a couple of the street stands, and though there are is some good product out there, I don't think any of them can hold a candle to Matt's. This is a solid four and a half star dog stand. It gets five on the review because tie goes to runner and Matt was working the counter when I came in. I asked what was good and sat down to a chili-cheese dog, half-order of cheese fries and a small straberry shake. Dog was great, bun fresh and perfectly steamed, chili good, fries crispy and shake was handmixed, just like 1950's style, all for 8 bucks. Matt is an afficianado and could write an authoritative article about the 125 best hot dog stands in the USA and that's the kind of guy I want cooking my next meal. i pick up veggi dogs for lunch sometimes, and they totally rule.
They make the most delicious crisscross fries with bleu cheese!Established in a former garage with a wooden deck where the car entrance used to be, this grimy and grungy place is the perfect environment for those yummy, greasy, saucy tidbits of chicken meat. Should your tolerance for spicy food be of herculean proportions then step up to the plate and order the infamous 7-star wing. There are other tasty treats like the aforementioned fries but you don't go to place called Wingdome and not order the wings!
Eats has recently started serving breakfast which makes it one of the few breakfast spots in West Seattle, especially as far south as Westwood Village.I love the banana and walnut covered waffle, it's sweet but not so much as to be decadent. The iced tea is great, they make their own blend of leaves. They cook bacon and eggs properly, no soggy bacon or runny eggs unless that's what you ask for. The prices aren't a bargain but I wouldn't call it expensive. Definitely a restaurant that I like being in the neighborhood. When I first moved to West Seattle, I repeatedly whined to friends about not having a great breakfast/brunch spot to go to. Well, I've finally found one.Eats Market Cafe is hidden inside Westwood Village, located right next to Bed, Bath and Beyond. Although it's a small space, the tables are far enough apart that you won't feel like you are sharing it with other people. Their brunch menu is excellent. I always get the farmhouse breakfast. The bacon is just the right amount of crispy. Eggs are fresh. The herb roasted potatoes are flavorful. If you're not a protein fan, they also have tasty french toasts and waffles. Prices aren't cheap, but it's not unreasonable either. If you're in the neighborhood (or not), it's definitely worth a trip to Eats Market Cafe.
This place is very nice! I went to the one in DC - and I really liked that one. I don't know -something here didn't feel 'right'. I just felt like our server (really nice guy, though) was trying too hard with fancy vocabulary and a straight face, knowing that he does not talk that way outside of work - Later finding him sayin, 'aww hell naw!' on the phone outside during a quick break. Strange. But other than that, the food was good- a little pricey though. The service was great and we were seated in less than a second. Very nice! I'll definitely come back! It was actually by lucky accident that I even stumbled across this recently opened restaurant in downtown Seattle. I was meeting a friend for lunch late one afternoon this week, and while googling restaurant options I mistakenly entered the wrong name of another downtown eatery. Coming across The Capital Grille I thought hey, why not!?!?Being later in the afternoon the restaurant was relatively empty when we got there, which provided a great look at the interior. The walls were covered by giant oil paintings many of which were famous Seattle icons. We sat across from Jimi Hendrix at the front of the house. The restaurant itself was clean and elegant with a mix of contemporary style and classic hard wood. The bar offers a great social gathering spot and on the way to the restroom you can enjoy the glass enclosed wine cellar.Our meal started with a cup of French Onion Soup and the amazing Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella with Vine Ripe Tomatoes. Along with our appetizers we ordered a bottle of The Spellbinder red blend from Slight of Hand winery. It's a great food friendly wine, and best yet one of the less expensive wines found on the massive wine list. One that includes hundreds (maybe thousands) of bottles from all over the world. There were many big reds to be found. It is a steakhouse after all.For my lunch entre I very much enjoyed the Lobster and Crab Burger. But this was a tough choice given the many delicious sounding options. They even had a Lobster Mac n Cheese, of which I am a true connoisseur. But that will have to wait for another day. The Truffle Fries were really good as well.The wait staff at The Capital Grille were all very friendly and accommodating. I think throughout the entire meal we had no less than 8 different people visit our table. At one point one even brought a round of pineapple infused vodka for us to try, which I gather The Capital Grille is known for. Again, yum! Unlike some local steak restaurants Capital is not just a great place for a good meal but also a good time. I highly recommend. Where's the best steak in Seattle? &#160;Ask that question and your carnivore friends may all have a different answer. The new Capital Grille will surely add another name to that discussion. The Capital Grille is a part of a chain, whose parent company also owns the likes of The Olive Garden, Red Lobster and Longhorn Steakhouse. This isn't an Olive Garden. It's a well oiled machine with a highly trained wait staff and kitchen turning out some great meals. It offers all one would want in a steakhouse experience, at least on par with the other established national steak houses and I think better than the other downtown local favorite. It has the mandatory bar just to the right of the entrance, a nice ambience that I'd expect to see at a steak place in NYC. It is somewhat localized with paintings of famous Seattle people throughout the restaurant. Again it is well staffed, our waiter was there when we needed him but not hovering when we wanted to socialize. While there was nothing extraordinary on the menu, the food was excellent. The lobster macroni and cheese is a killer side. Nice selection of wines with I guess reasonable prices, many under $50. Yes, The Capital Grille is spendy but no more so than its competitors. I suspect many of the patrons will be business people on expense accounts. I'll surely welcome an invitation to be taken there. Amazing service, amazing food. &#160;Have the lobster and crab burger. &#160;The chips that come with it are good, but I like to order a side of veggies instead. A friend and I were fortunate to be invited to the preview at Capital Grille the week of January 28, 2008. &#160;The location is in the heart of downtown Seattle, on the corner of Fourth and University. &#160;It is hard to imagine the space in its prior incarnation as an airline office. &#160;The decor is swanky and inviting and includes horseshoe booths, jazz music, art and crafts ceiling lighting, and large pieces of art that do not take themselves too seriously. &#160;For example, a huge oil painting of Jimi Hendrix hangs in the bar area, complete with estate lighting above it.The staff were attentive and overly-nervous, but hey! it was their first week. &#160;We ordered medium-rare steaks, french fries with truffle oil, ceasar salad, and clam chowder. &#160;We had to chuckle when we were not quite finished with our first course, and the steaks arrived. &#160;We would not have objected had the steaks had been delivered at that point, but the wait staff acted as though a major faux pas had been committed. &#160;Cute.The steaks were aged in-house and were superb. &#160;The fries were drenched in truffle oil, and who can complain about that? &#160;The ceasar salad was tart and salty and crisp, and the clam chowder was chock-full of clams and obviously homemade. &#160;Wonderful.The highlight was the cheesecake with a carmelized top, placed upon a bed of fresh berries, including raspberries and blackberries. &#160;It was like eating a chessecake and a creme brulee combined, and the fruit was plump and juicy. &#160;Welcome, Capital Grille! THE LOWDOWN:1. Service: The service was fun and cool even though they were wearing coats that would establish something more upscale. They managed to not be pretentious while still taking care of us (I think our server was Robyn). And a nice interesting personal touch is that our server had a business card to give us to invite us back.2. Food: The food is a bit expensive but the menu that they have totally calls for it. I had the most perfect smoked salmon and a fantastic asparagus (my favorite vegetable). A great meal and probably my new pick for the last meal I should have.3. Atmopshere: I like the ambiance, it had nice, refined and warm touches. It's a good reprieve from the chilly cold and rainy Seattle. It seems like it would be a perfect place for groups or something more intimate should you prefer.All in all, a very good choice. I loved it, from the moment I walked in. Loved it. The staff there is so friendly and had such a warm charm to them that they could care less that we had all stumbled in from a wet and rainy opening day at the Mariner's.A typical Seattle spring day ended in an amazing steakhouse experience. Everything was great. I had one of the best rib eye's i have ever had; some of the best lobster mac n cheese I have ever had and even great asparagus - which I usually avoid. Its pricey - but its a steak house. I would compare it to the Met - without all the hub bub - Morton's with windows, and the Brooklyn without the oysters. Our server, well, the entire staff we met, was really nice. Downright fun. They are never fun at the Brooklyn, they may have been 42 years ago, but not anymore.The drinks were great - they even had some house infused vodkas. The pineapple was dangerous. It tasted like juice! They had a great list of vodkas and bourbons - that's all I needed and then some!A+ on the new guy in town! Nicely done! I just dined at Capital Grille Thursday night (still in their first week of opening) for my birthday with 6 friends. &#160;They have FREE VALET. We started at the bar while waiting for our table and the bartenders were very helpful with wine choices and attentive (some great options by the glass - if you like big wines the Wilderness Cab/Syrah blend is wonderful). &#160;Our waiter, Ryan, was friendly, knowledgeable and capable. &#160;I started with the lobster bisque (not on the menu, but I saw it online) which was very good. &#160;The highlight of the evening was my seared tenderloin with lobster. &#160;The tenderloin was cooked to perfection, silky, and practically melted in your mouth (I ordered it medium, but with this cut medium rare would have been fabulous). It was sitting atop an extraordinary lemon/butter sauce and creamy mashed potatoes. There were two large lobster claw chunks sitting on top, which were moist and also cooked perfectly. &#160;I also tasted the porcini rubbed delmonico, which had very good flavor (it was huge), and although very good I didn't think the kona steak lived up to expectations. Both were a bit overcooked for my taste (at the request of the people who ordered them). The pork chop was very generously spiced with a lot of flavor and even some heat. &#160;The citrus salmon was good, not overcooked with great texture, but nothing special. &#160;One person in the party ordered a 2lb lobster, but they apparently ran out of those so our waiter brought her a 3lb lobster at the 2lb price. Great lobster, but again nothing special. &#160;The lobster mac &amp; cheese had huge chunks of lobster and was very good - I also wasn't a big fan of all the crumbs on top, but it didn't diminish how good the dish was. &#160;The creamed spinach was good with a touch of nutmeg and the truffle fries were amazing.There are a few bottles of very good, very reasonable priced wines (the beaujolais-villages was a great starter and went with all dishes, only $26 and we also had a spanish bodegas that went great with the red meats as well as fish and lobster, $27). &#160;I did enjoy that we were given plenty of time in between courses, just enough time to make more room. &#160;They seemed to take quite awhile to bring the dessert menu, but then brought out a complimentary coconut cream pie. The people at the table that are not coconut fans even liked it. &#160;Our waiter then brought out another complimentary flourless chocolate espresso cake with raspberries. It was ok, but did go very well with my after dinner port. &#160;I got a trio of sandemans ($11), graham's ? ($11), and the Taylor Fladgate 1985 ($32), they were out of the 1997, and oddly they all tasted the same. Overall service was impeccable (with the exception of the hostess who forgot to tell some of our party that we were already at the bar) and the food and wine was excellent. Decor and atmosphere are also very nice. I haven't yet tried the Met or El Gaucho, but I only gave 4 stars since restaurants like Canlis and Herbfarm are a notch above. Like the first two reviews, I too got to preview this new restaurant before it opened to the public. Gretchen was right....there was a ton of wait staff there to greet us, take our coats and seat us. Our waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu and how the food is prepared. I started with the Tomato Mozzarella and Basil Salad. This salad was great. It had huge slabs of mozzarella cheese. It almost had too much cheese...if that's even possible. I love cheese! I selected the Dry Aged Sirloin Steak for the main course. Our waiter explained to us how the pieces of steak are hung and aged for almost three weeks to bring out all the flavor. Let me tell you....this steak had tons of flavor! It was by far one of the best steaks I've had in over a year. It was cooked just right, and at 14 oz it was a good portion. For the preview dinner the chef selected the dessert. We were served a bowl of mixed berries in cream sauce. This dessert was excellent. We capped it off with a cup of coffee. I know this was a preview dinner, but if The Capital Grille's service and food remains this good they will definitely be one of the best steak houses in Seattle.Oh, one cool thing about The Capital Grille is the art on the walls. They have huge oil paintings of famous Seattlites. When you walk in the front door to the left is a painting of Chief Sealth (Chief Seattle). To the right on the side wall is an oil painting of Jimi Hendrix. There are also oil paintings of John Nordstrom, Eddie Bauer, William Boeing, and Bruce Lee throughout the restaurant. The decor of the restaurant is similar to most steak houses, but it's not as dark as El Gaucho, and not as cramped as the Metropolitan Grill. Do yourself a favor and check out The Capital Grille.
3.5 starsThey have definitely expanded a whole lot more then what I remember as a child. It has not expanded out into what was once more parking space. I appreciate this in some senses but then when its busy and theres no room, I dont care for it.Nonetheless, this place has a good amount of varieties when it comes to asian/island culture food. The best thing about this place is their fried chk wings! We always get a tray (half or full) or parties. Its a deal, half trays are $23 and full trays $40. The trays are usually full, its tasty as heck! Anything else regarding veggies/meat, ill get it else where. Too crowded for my taste. One to the two threeCruise on the hill, gettin food at Fou LeeGonna take more than a few to fool meOnly get this timin if you study Kool G ooooh weeeeeBlue Scholars know wassupand you should too.I work at a non-profit. &#160;When we need a large mass of food to feed hungry, inner-city folk both adults and youth alike, we choose fou lee. &#160;They got the cheapest prices for large trays of chow mein, pinakbet, fish, eggrolls, bahn mi's.. you effing name it, they got it. &#160;For large platters, order a day ahead.Westernized folk don't get it. &#160;And sorry, but that's more fou lee for me :) P.S- Yes, the parking lot is a disaster. &#160;Now you know. &#160; Fou Lee is worth it I've been shopping here since they first opened and they have improved their store a lot over the years. &#160;What is a Chinese grocery store has since accommodated to their Filipino customers. &#160;Here, I buy my packs of tocino and longanisa. &#160;You get so much more for the same price you'd pay for only 8 longanisas by Espi's.What I especially like about going here is their party trays you can order. &#160;You can order fresh spring rolls, deep fried chicken wings, fried rice, and even desserts such as puto, kutsinta, etc. Cheap!! I love foulee! &#160;If they know you're a filipina they will always call you maganda! haha that's wussup!I grew up with this place and it just reminds me of childhood. :) &#160;They have a great fusion of food &amp; a lot of filipino dishes! &#160;Their fried shrimp is prrrrrettty bomb!I've never had a problem with customer service here and I think it is a great local market! The only problem is parking, but its it's workable! A great little store that caters to Filipino food. The prices are cheap and the vegtables are fresh. I have been going to this store for many years. I always wanted to visit this market after hearing about it from a song from the Blue Scholars. When I got here, it was definitely an older style market. It's not like those typical warehouse markets that you see, but rather a good ol' Ma n Pa style where the prices are affordable and the amount of Filipino goods available are great. They also have a area where they sell food items are a decent price. I'm from california so seeing a Filipino based market is awesome. Enjoyed the time buying goods here and hopefully can come back PS: parking is bad. This place is very very clean in comparison to most Asian grocery stores around Seattle. It does not smell at all. It's clean and their prizes is fare. Their vegetable are fresh. Their take-out food is not too expensive and they make it pretty good. They also sell bubble tea. It's owned by Vietnamese but they are like Filipinos. They make Filipino food. Amazing to see Vietnamese people make Filipino food. It's great. They are very friendly and helpful. They are not grumpy and impersonal like most Asian stores around. They are professional and know how to run their business. They are well organized and facility is clean. I would totally recommend this place.
Mezcaleria Oaxaca does serve black people, as well as people of any other race. What they don't do is let people who arrive late join a party that's already been seated - this policy is for people of every race. I suspect either the people complaining below didn't know this policy, or thought they could circumvent it and when Mezcaleria Oaxaca stood their ground, they got upset. Their seating policy is posted on their Facebook page (and seems to have been done so in direct response to this issue):Just a friendly reminder .... (as has been the policy with La Carta de Oaxaca for the past eight years). Mezcaleria Oaxaca is a small, family operated restaurant. We do not take reservations. Please note that all members of your party must be present to be seated. Also, we do not allow additions to tables that have already been seated. No exceptions. Upon arrival, please provide your name to the host to be placed on the waiting list. Customers disrupting the dining experiences of other guests may be asked to leave. Thank you for understanding and support of Mezcaleria Oaxaca... Underwhelmed. &#160;Chips and guac were good ... as were the homemade tortillas. &#160;Aside from that, I had the goat and wasn't very impressed. &#160;My boyfriend had an enchilada with mole and a piece of carne asada. &#160;His family is from Oaxaca and he was less than impressed. I'm a fan, a welcome departure from standard northwest Mexican fare. I had a tamale of mole and chicken, the goat (tender and spicy!), and one other app. dish. Definitely brought me back to my recent Mexico trip. Service is super fast and there's a salsa bar in the bizarre super bright back room. Who doesn't love a salsa bar? Peeking through the front windows at the small bar area with seating, you may not notice the long hallway to an equally small rear dining room. &#160;The walls are covered with wonderful photos both old and new, some interesting Mexican bric a brac, and the rear room is dominated by a wonderful photo of a Mexican lady looking down approvingly at the plates of food. &#160;And, she should. &#160;As much as I enjoy Mama's Mexican Kitchen for it's funk and combo meals, I enjoy more the authenticity of Mezcaleria Oaxaca. &#160;How many Mexican restaurants serve goat? &#160;Their mole is the best mole in town. &#160;The best. &#160;There is a bar of house made salsas of varying types and you help yourself to your favorite(s). &#160;The obligatory chip basket is an extra charge here though it does come with guacamole. &#160;The food is so full of flavors, so interesting and often unique we gladly paid the extra charge for the chips. Tacos Al Pastor are delicious. I recommend and I am definitely coming back to this place. After spending one month in Oaxaca, I can tell you this is the real deal. I for one loved the food in Oaxaca, so was happy to come home to Mezcaleria Oaxaca. I have to say the dishes I had here are exactly the same as the food prepared by my host family. &#160;Just like any country different types of food come from different regions- keep this in mind if you are expecting large diarrhea inducing, cheese soaked, &#160;Mexican food. From my experience, Oaxacan food comes in smaller portions, is made fresh and does not use a lot of greasy oily cheese and this is what you will find here! I'm such a big fan of La Carta de Oaxaca in Ballard I was thrilled when I heard they were going to open another restaurant in Queen Anne. Food and drinks are amazing. I had goat for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. FYI they dont take reservations and wont seat you untill your entire party is there. Don't know about this whole racist thing, Ive been a long time customer and find this hard to believe. I guess we will see... My husband and I tried Mezcaleria Oaxaca in Queen Anne on 1/25 Wednesday at dinner and had a wonderful experience. &#160;The decor of the space is beautiful, the food was delicious, and the service we received from the host and our waiter (who was also the bartender) Damon was excellent. &#160;In particular, the margaritas were delicious and my husband absolutely loved the Posole. &#160;My favorite dish was the tender pork tamale served with a mole sauce. &#160;The prices are very reasonable and we did not have to wait long to be seated. &#160;We can't wait to go back and try more of the delicious items on the menu! Hmmmm....Yes, so good. &#160;Atmosphere was great, just 'down home' enough but still well put together, not a whiff of 'lame nightlife' but still a flirty fun bar.However, I'll say that between serving a cute little beast as your special, the taxidermy and hairchair, those abstaining from meat for ethical reasons might want to move down the road.My friends took me here with one thing in mind. Get the goat.We can't wait for the goat. &#160;The goat is so good!But you'll never guess what they were out of at 8pm on a Saturday night?Yup, the goat.What I ordered was really good, but not so good I remember what it was.My cocktail was strong and delicious, something on their suggested menu.I'd go back and admit, this is not your average Americanized Mexican place, but I think I'm spoiled growing up in Long Beach, CA. I mean, I remember those goats tied up outside the taco stand.Don't pet them, mom would say. Now I know why. La Carta, all grown up....That's how I feel in Mezcaleria. Even when it's crowded, the bustle is quieter and the voices less boisterous. The bar is downright spacious, and the salsa bowls sit quietly all the way in the back of the restaurant (only three salsas, and sadly no tomatillo to be seen). But...goat. And masa. If you need a reason to come to Queen Anne instead of Ballard, let it be that. Those.For anyone who has yet to nibble on the tender flavor-soaked falling-apart strands of cabrito, or spoon up the gently-sweet masa (a new preparation for me, much like a very loose and grainier version of corn pudding), let tonight be your night. Goat is a rich meat that lends itself well to low-and-slow, like barbecue, (lingual mother: barbacoa). It's a special highlight here for a reason. Go early, so they don't run out (although when it was ordered on two of my three visits, they had it). And wash it down with the mezcalerita, apparently the bartender's choice for best drink. I'll be back to taste that one! I've also tried the pozole (brothier than I'm used to, but with fork-tender pork and plump hominy) and the halibut tacos. Those were a real standout as well: succulent creamy halibut in generous chunks topped with a tiny smear of guacamole and a generous line of spicy orange-chipotle sauce, fresh and bracing. The plate offers three small tacos, so it's an excellent choice if you plan to do some feasting on chips and drinking of margaritas and mezcaleritas but don't want a huge meal otherwise (although pretty much everything served here at MO, as at La Carta, avoids behemoth status - thank God).There's something about MO that makes me miss La Carta; I think Queen Anne is simply not my place, and so this spot feels bit too family-oriented or subdued compared to the liveliness and constant stranger-brushing you endure for a Ballard table. On the other hand, it's nice to be able to walk in on a weeknight and be seated immediately at the bar with no waiting, so there are advantages.Either way, let there be goat.... I have long lamented the lack of amazing Mexican restaurants in Washington state. I got spoiled with a plethora of them in more southern reaches, and since moving back north I've yet to be truly wowed about anywhere I have been. I've found good places, enjoyable places, but never anything that made my mouth water simply thinking about the establishment. That is until I came here...I've yet to try Carta, and I know people can go on about how this is Oaxacan food and therefore different, but I don't care. All I know is I can eat that cabrito until there are no goats left in the PNW to satisfy my desire. My company chose this spot for our date -- so HE got the cabrito, I got the asada enchilada con mole. The asada itself was perfect and the flavor delicious and savory, the mole quite flavorful but a little sweeter than I would have preferred. A healthy (and maybe sacrilegious?) douse of spicy salsa on top made it just right. But the cabrito. Every time I was offered a bite i greedily took it and groaned. Smokey, flavorful, and absolutely delightful when rolled up into a fresh made corn tortilla. When I come back, which I plan to often, I won't be getting anything else.My margarita was boozy and a great accompaniment to my meal as well. Their horchata was divine and a warning for those allergic to tree nuts - has a sprinkle of crushed pecans (I myself loved that!)Decor is cute and themed as one may expect. The place is a bit small, but there is extra seating in the back. We sat at the bar right in front of the employee who was making the tortillas and it was super fun to watch (and handy when we wanted an extra one). We went dutch, and checks were easily split.I have found my shining star of Mexican (Oaxacan) cuisine in Washington, and my belly and I couldn't be happier. Carne asada tacos muy fant&#225;stico! Chips are delish. Prices reasonable. Service is excellent and friendly, and plenty of seating. Not sure what a couple of the whiners are going on about, but we've been to Mezcaleria twice, and Oaxaca many times, and it's some of the best regional Mexican food in town. For those who think it should be just like Oaxaca (yes, we've been there) they should have been in Seattle when we came her in 1978 - this town was a Mexican food wasteland; it didn't exist except for Guadalajara downtown. Dinner two nights ago for four of us. &#160;Very fresh and unique Mexican dishes, we each had a different meal. &#160;Personally, I thought my roasted goat was perfect. &#160;Must have the guacamole, but beware...the salsas are sauces are very hot for all 4 of our tastes. &#160;My son and I said we'd go back, but the ladies said "no". &#160;Recommended if you can handle some heat. I went here very shortly after it first opened. Great food! Went here yesterday for lunch with a friend, and everything was absolutely delicious! We ordered 3 plates since they were pretty small portioned and all of them were amazing, especially the banana leaf pork tamale. This is definitely Oaxacan food, not your run of the mill Mexican food. YUM! The food is incredible by itself (tomatillo enchiladas, omg!), but the bartender, Damon is the lime on top. He went into beast mode and dealt me some of the best tequila concoctions in ages! WELL worth the climb up the hill- ten billion times better than pesos frat party b.s. atmosphere. Go here now and drink some Cazadores! This more than an ok 3 star review btw.After finding out that the creators of Carta de Oaxaca opened this Mexican joint I had to try it and see if it offered the same quality.I got there around 7 pm and the place had a waiting line but after checking in for two, no later than 5 minutes and I was seated,their menu is small and simple offering from chips an guacamole to complex dishes like chile rellenos.After looking over the menu I finally landed it on a seafood stew which I had not eaten in many many years probably since I was like 12 years old and now at my roughly 20 I had to eat it again and go back in time. My date ordered the asada tacos. Food came promptly and fresh the first thing I noticed is that the tacos were on the small side(normal mexican taco) but I'm sure most of the people will think they are small since they are used huge Americanized tacos :) anyways my seafood stew had crab, shrimp and fish and it comes with tortillas, onion, lime and cilantro.If you order the stew I'd strongly recommend to eat the fish slowly and expect bones in it otherwise you could cut your mouth:SOther than that food is great Mexican flavor! I'm lying in a haze, my stomach happily protuberant, my mind warmed by a few tasty margaritas. My tongue is hanging out, and I swear there is a pair of tiny Mexican men dancing around it like a sombrero in the sand.Great food, fast service, cool space. So, so....why no 5 stars?Well, because my wife is vegetarian, and their veg offering was a squash of some sort deep fried in an egg batter. I tasted it. It was interesting, but I could easily see how one could be put off by the heavy smoke flavor. She didn't like it. My wife asked if there was anything else, but was told no. Really? I've cooked in a serious Mexican restaurant, and it was pretty easy to offer many dishes like tacos, burritos, etc....with a veg option. Its not like you have to risk a lot of expensive ingredients to offer it. &#160;There you have it folks. A carnivore bitching about vegetarian food while Mexican men dance around his tongue. LOVED IT! Came here with my bf, parking was a little bleh, but hey, what are you going to do? And don't look for a sign outside, you won't see one. It was a little busy inside, but one of the guys came right up to us and asked how many in our party and that it'd be 10-15 min. for the wait. Not too bad. Then the bartender came over and got our drink order, I got a sangria ($8), which are sooooo good. About 10 min. later, we saw a spot for 2 open at the front bar and took that right away. Apparently, the bar section up front is first come, first served, so be warned. The back area is where you sit when you get on the waiting list. The bartender got my bf's drink order (Dos Equis...and they only have Mexican beers, I'm pretty sure) and then asked if we wanted chips and guac ($5) and those are so yumm. Shortly after we took a look at the menu, we ordered our dinner. I got the chile relleno ($10?), yumm, and my bf got the enchiladas (forgot which ones, they had a green sauce, white rice and pinto beans). The staff is fast, friendly, and informative. The space is small, but I can't complain, the food is so good and the drinks, too. Overall, our bill was about $40, not too bad for a Saturday night out. My bf didn't like that the plates weren't humongous, but not everywhere is Azteca, I explained to him, haha. It's good, homecooked food and it's authentic, you just can't beat it. I'll be here again soon! I met up with a friend for some drinks and some grub. I've always been picky about Mexican food (perhaps from being spoiled by living in Socal for two years). I'm still fairly new to the Seattle foodscape and am always on the prowl for some good eats. My friend often frequents the one in Ballard and we decided to give this one a try. She warned me that you have to come a certain time before it gets packed and I saw that she wasn't kidding. We got real lucky when this couple left and we were able to snag the two chairs at the nearly crowded bar. With that said...The margaritas were amazing--it had that perfect balance of sweetness and sourness that I like. Often times I've had margaritas where one usually overpowers the other. I also enjoyed the tortilla chips and the guac, but I really fell in love with the tortillas. Now, moving on to the food. We ordered the carne asada, the goat, and tamales. I really liked that the carne asada was very tender and fresh, but I felt that it was lacking that special "kick". I added a bit of the sauce from my chips to the meat to give it that extra "oomph". I felt that the goat was okay and the tamales were way too sweet.Overall, I felt that it was a great place to meet up for a drink or two before moving along. There's not a whole I can add here that hasn't already been said by a bunch of others. The food here is great but you should come expecting Oaxacan food and not "Mexican" food. I've read some other reviewers describes this place as being "authentic Mexican" but that's a bit misleading. Oaxacan food and Mexican food, while very related, are not the same thing. So, for example, if you order the enchiladas, don't expect the cheesy, goopy stuff that you would get at a Mexican restaurant. It's still very good but it's really a different dish.As much as I love this place (especially since it's within walking distance for me), I think it's sister-restaurant in Ballard is probably a tad better. It could be that they are still working out some kinks here and perhaps in a few more months it will be just as good if not better. Let's hope so. I went on a Thursday night. It was about 6pm and it was already buzzin'. I ordered a regular margarita(Mezcali I think). It was delicious! Arn the bartender knows his tequila! Plus, he's pleasant to look at;) I stood at this little table in front of the bar waiting for a stool to open up. I was approached by a gentleman that was enjoying a drink next to me. We started chtting about this and that, but mostly about the food/drink and ambiance of this new restaurant. It was a lovely interaction with a complete stranger. Left the conversation with a smile on my face. I sat down at the bar and Arn said, "So I see you meet my boss...the owner." I blushed immediately! I think it's GREAT that owners take the time to speak with customers to get a feel for the customers opinion. Very business savvy:) I had the Tacos Dorados, which are basically like taquitos. It was very tasty! The pork rolled inside has a sweet but smoky flavor to it and was accompanied by all the right fixins.They have a salsa bar in the back I hear, but I didn't venture that way. It was pretty busy around 7, so expect to wait about 15-20 minutues. Well worth it though! The photography is amazing and it seemed to attract all sort of people/personalities...couples with young children, gay/lesbian, old, young, etc. I highly recommend this sister restaurant to La Carta De Oaxaca in Ballard. You won't be disappointed! I tried this place twice before I would review it. Sadly I just cant get into it. I think our favorite things on the menu are the tacos.Also the salsa bar is pretty wonderful as well. &#160;With that said I think the ambiance makes up for any of the food shortfall. Small portions. Maybe 3rd time will be the charmer. We shall see Tied for best mexican in WA. &#160;Fantastic. We had just returned from Mexico and needed a taco/margarita/cerveza fix. &#160;Mezcaleria Oaxaca really hit the spot! &#160;We were the first to arrive when they opened at 5 but the place almost immediately filled up. &#160;My Sauza margarita was strong and very tasty (my boyfriend had the Mezcalerita, which he liked, but was a bit too smoky for me). &#160;We had chips and salsa (they have a self-serve salsa bar), followed by two kinds of tacos, and everything was fresh and delicious. &#160;Having spent the past week eating "real" Mexican food, we found this place to be surprisingly authentic and would definitely come back. Great food and service. &#160;It was a bit of a wait on saturday night (not unexepected) but the bartender was great about providing drinks and chips while we waited. Goat Smoke! If you head to the back dining room at Mezcaleria Oaxaca- that's all you'll smell. They have this amazing slow cooker/roaster in the corner of the back dining room where they roast the "Cabrito" for hours. And when it's done- it's one of the tastiest things I have had in a long time. Queen Anne is immensely lucky to have this awesome new restaurant. Ballard has been lucky for a long time to have a restaurant run by these folks (La Carta de Oaxaca)- and I think they have perfected their goal of bringing Oaxaca to the Northwest in Queen Anne. They have only been open a couple of days- but already they seem to have found their groove. It's amazing what they have done with the space- it's beautiful inside. The service was top notch- Gerome at the bar let us taste a few Mezcals (kinda like smoky tequila)- and he makes a nice Sangria that wifey really enjoyed. To start- we had the Ceviche- which was super fresh and tasty. Mostly fish. Comes with a chipotle orange sauce that has a little heat. Then moved to the Mole Negro with Pork Ribs. The serving was a little small- but I honestly ate every last morsel and almost licked the plate it was so good. Their Mole is some of the best in Seattle I think- little sweet, little savory, little smoky. Finally had the Cabrito (roasted goat that is). It comes with Masa (kinda like Southern Grits)- and a dark sauce that was really delicious. The goat was just a little gamey and super tender- it was honestly the best Goat I have ever had. They bring out freshly made tortillas- so you can make little tacos. They have a salsa bar (like in Ballard)- with Pico and a couple of salsas for on the side. The hot one is my favorite. Get to this place soon before everyone knows about it. I think it's better than La Carta de Oaxaca in Ballard- and if their level of business is any indicator- pretty soon it's going to be tough to get a seat at Mezcaleria Oaxaca. If you have to wait though- do it- it's worth it. Queen Anne is lucky to have Mezcaleria Oaxaca in the neighborhood. &#160;The menu is similar to (but in my opinion more interesting than) the sister restaurant in Ballard, and the mezcal margaritas were GOOD. &#160;I found the decor and atmosphere much warmer and more welcoming than Oaxaca in Ballard. &#160;There were lots of seating options and the waitstaff was SUPER friendly and on-point. &#160;I can't recall a single instance of waitstaff in Ballard stopping back by the table to check on how I was enjoying the food, etc. &#160;Finally, the goat was DELISH. &#160;We'll be back soon, and often!Also, this whole racism thing is ridiculous. &#160;If you have experienced a problem with service first-hand, fine; vent away. &#160;But if you have just "heard" that this restaurant doesn't serve certain types of people, don't post scathing reviews that could damage their business. &#160; Give me a break. The food here is incredible!!! Very authentic. Do yourself a favor and try the caldo de mariscos, it is the best I have ever tried north of the border.I'm not sure how the racism charges started but I find it strange how all the people making these charges are from California and have probably never even set foot in this place. Their policy has always been that they will not seat ANYONE late to a big party because of the way their dining space is set up. If the people making these charges had ever been to the place, or the location in Ballard, they would know this. Great restaurant, great people, and great food and i for one welcome them to Queen Anne. Mezcaleria Oaxaca is owned by the same people that own La Carta de Oaxaca in Ballard. &#160;I love that place. &#160;I have dreams - dreams, I tell you, of the entomatadas with the green sauce. Back to the new place - I LOVE it. &#160;The menu is different, but the service, the food, and people are the same. &#160;Great service, amazing food, and all of the people there are really nice. &#160;Start off with a margarita - trust me. &#160;I like the chips and guacamole, paired with the pico de gallo from the salsa bar. &#160;I have tried the pozole, the goat, and &#160;the tacos. &#160;All of it amazing. &#160;Delicious! &#160;I am so happy that they are here in our little hood! I went here for three reasons:1. Though my family tree contains zero Latin blood, I strongly believe I'm part Mexican. Mexicans seem to believe this too. I'm cool with that.2. My foodie friends raved about this place.3. I read Jennily D's review and promptly resolved to prove her ignorance with regard to knowing what "authentic" Mexican food entails (i.e. They cook with MEAT. And they drink strong drinks.) and to off-set her ill-informed review with my 5 stars.So I went. And I am just giddy that I did. First of all, they are open late. And they don't turn people away. Yes, it gets busy. Probably because all the other lame restaurants on QA close the kitchen by 9-9:30, even on weekends. The food was amazing. It's the real deal. Handmade tortillas (we sat and watched the poor girl churn out about 100 while we sat across the bar from her, downing margs). I had the cabrito which is one of my fave dishes. I can't turn it down if it's on the menu. This was no exception. It was flavorful and tender and despite my desire to exhibit self-control and get a doggy-bag, I ate the whole damn plate. After eating a basket of those perfectly-salted-made-to-order tortilla chips. Hey, gotta justify my gym membership somehow, right?The bevs: Could I tell a difference between the margarita and paloma? No. But for $8 a pint, I didn't care. They were both delicious and refreshing.The chips and guac cost $5, which didn't bother me, but if you're looking to curtail extraneous spending (and/or calories), keep that in mind. I personally think they're worth it. Especially with the addicitive salsa bar.So for chips/guac, two entrees, and three rounds of cocktails, we came out at just over $70. I think that's a damn steal. Especially for the quality of food/bev. I am not sure how people consider $10-$13/entree "overpriced," but maybe they should stick to Old Country Buffet. Or the dollar menu.In summary, we have:1. Reasonably priced/sized cocktails2. Authentic and delicious food3. Handmade tortillas3. Real Mexicans actually making Mexican food4. Open lateSounds like WINNING to me. Oh, that, and the fact that they totally humored my Spanish-speaking attempts. This place will change your opinion of "Mexican" food. You won't find burrito's swimming in cheese, sour cream, beans, rice and guacamole here. You won't leave feeling fit to burst. You will have a better understanding of what carefully crafted Mexican food can be like. The mole is outstanding and the tortillas are hand made every night. The bar is well stocked with every type of Tequila imaginable and the atmosphere is the best of any restaurant on Queen Anne hill. Service is finding its way as the place is newly opened so don't be a hater. If you want to experience a Mexican family meal, made with love, this is the place. Have your patient socks on. GREAT food, good service. I'm a super huge fan of their sister restaurant in Ballard so I was happy to hear they opened another place in a different neighborhood. &#160;The bar here is much more spacious and if there's only 2 in your party, you can pony up to the bar or one of the small tables in the front and eat without having to wait for a table in the back. &#160;I had 3 friends with me so we enjoyed some margaritas out front while we waited, always a good thing. &#160;I was happy to see that the menu items vary from the original Oaxaca. &#160;We had to get the chips and guac to start, a must! &#160;We also shared the ceviche and tamales con mole - both great. &#160;For an entree, I got the enchiladas con mole which were very tasty. &#160;I wanted to try the goat but one of my friends got it instead so I got to try a bite. &#160;Reminds me of the lamb barria at Oaxaca, very yummy! &#160;We always get the standard margaritas but decided to try out the mezcalaritas since that's their specialty here. &#160;They are much more of a sipping drink with just the right amount of smokey taste. &#160;I will have another one when I go back, which I will hopefully do soon! &#160;I'm just as in love as I am with the other place, so good!! Food was pretty darn good, but the portion was a lot smaller than what I'm used to from a Mexican restaurant/foodtruck (lol).Decor is a lot like their other restaurant La Carta over in Ballard.Service was great and attentive! GIVE ME MORE FOOD NEXT TIME!!! =) ZOMG!! I wish that I could give this place 6 stars! It was that good. I'd read such glowing reviews of this place, notwithstanding one vegan who apparently doesn't understand how or where she should be eating out in Seattle. :-| We also L-O-V-E its sister restaurant La Carta de Oaxaca. Note to all vegans: Don't go there either. ;-)We started with the guacamole, which was fresh and flavorful. Their tortilla chips were also excellent, thin and fresh-cooked when you order them. I found their salsa bar to be a wee bit wanting in that there were only three salsas. I hope this is something that they'll expand somewhat in the future. But what was there was excellent, and I'd rather have three great salsas than six that are so-so. ;-)For the main attraction, I had the barbacoa de cabrito, one of my favorite Mexican dishes. This was the BEST rendition of that dish that I've ever eaten anywhere, including Mexico. My spousal unit had the enchiladas con mole, which included some very tender and flavorific carne asada (her favorite Mexican dish). She also had the Margarita Sauza, which gets two thumbs up.We finished off our wondermous meal by splitting a shot of the very tasty &#160;Zacatecano Reposada mezcal, which was recommended by our waiter Victor.The service was top flight for the entire staff. We sat at one of the 2-person tables where we had a view of the kitchen. I highly recommend sitting there or at the bar where the seats are well-spaced and also provide an entertaining view of the kitchen. Like their sister restaurant, the authentic decorations were very nice.Oh, and our tab for all this great food, 2 margies, 2 Negro Modelos, and an ample shot of mezcal? Only $53.75 before tip. What a bargain! Vamos a volver pronto!! After drooling over the tortilla bar for 40 minutes while waiting for our table, we finally were seated...at the bar. ??? I thought we were waiting the 40 minutes for a table, but greedily thought, "whatever gets me closer to the tortillas." At least the hostess went above and beyond in giving us unprompted updates on our table status while we were waiting. Brownie points for her.Mezcalerita. WOW. One of these yelp stars go directly to this smokey, lime infused dream that just outdid it's cousin, the marg. Crushed Ice is always a plus.For the entree...had a pretty delicious barbacoa goat dish. I ate it all, but wished for more than two little corn tortillas. Wishing was all I could do because I think I saw our server once. My friend's carne dish didn't look like anything special, but I wasn't really concerned because mine was delicious. I did not experience order envy.Not a lot of space in here, it's better for drinks &amp; perhaps some snacking. But all is forgiven as long as my stomach is happy. Which it was.Mezcalerita. This place is a lot like their other location. I enjoyed the food, wasn't as keen on the mezcal-margarita, an acquired taste I guess. Seafood stew &amp; the goat were both unique &amp; tasty. Portion sizes are smaller than what I would expect at a Tex-Mex place, but this isn't a Tex-Mex place. Besides most places in this city have made portion sizes smaller in recent history. Cheery space &amp; good service. There is a sign on the door that says they cannot seat you unless your entire party is present, maybe not the most popular policy, but considering their table turnover rate, I get it. Not sure about all of the "this place is racist" talk, it's the exact same staff that's been working in their Ballard location &amp; they've never had an issue as far as I can tell. Food is very tasty and they use fresh ingredients. &#160;When you enter in, it doesn't seem very big until they take you to the back of the restaurant. &#160;There are several tables back there that can accommodate large groups. &#160;When I was dining there, it was only 2 of us and we were escorted to the back. &#160;The only problem was that it was very loud and I couldn't carry a conversation without yelling. Service is quick and friendly. The handmade corn tortillas are super yummy! New place? Tasty drinks? Cute bartender? Okay!I was notified of the sister to La Carta in my neighborhood, and thought I'd join the Friday night festivus. Thank goodness my friend showed up and pawed on the glass at opening time, or certainly we'd have waited who-knows-how-long with all the other schmoes in the joint.Mescalerita, a nice smoky twist on a margarita, but nothing special save the use of Mescal. For foods, my friend got the pozole, which appeared to have chunks of meat that were spoon-tender and savory. I sampled the tamale, enchiladas, and chiles con rellenos (I brought stuff home for my people, jeez!). Of those, the tamales were tasty, I think a mole sauce was present. Either way, a nice balance of salty, cheesy, corny goodness. A bit on the greasy side and the banana leaf was like an oily wet blanket. Sod off, garnish! Enchiladas were tasty, though smallish, and could have been meatier. The chiles rellenos was a massive disappointment. The pepper was overwhelmingly hot, which reduced the other seemingly-complex flavors to mere afterthoughts. The meat tasted as though it had been cooked with sweetened earl grey tea. Is that normal? The restaurant is loud and crowded: expect a long wait. And other folks at the bar seemed unusually nosy (only-the-lonely dude that reeks of Drakkar Noir, I'm looking at you!)All in all, a tasty Mexican dinner. Not the best in town, but easily in the top few. I visited twice in one week and both experiences were vastly different. On a Saturday at 7pm it was jam packed compared to the wide open restaurant on Tuesday at 6pm. That said, after being told it would be a 25 minute wait on saturday we were actually seated within 5 minutes. I had the carne asada tacos, which were really good but teeeeeeny tiny, 2-bite tacos. You have to pay for your chips, which is fine but the first time I was there I was not informed that there was a help yourself salsa bar! I thought it seemed weird that guacamole was the only option! &#160;The second time around I was able to try a few of the salsas and ordered the enchiladas con mole, which made me happier....except for the fact that there's no churros! Mexican food starts with beans and rice, and the Mezcaleria does both very well. The mole is exceptional; try it via a banana leaf wrapped tamale. The wait staff is knowledgeable and ambiance fits the food (not sure how else to describe, but it works). I personally enjoy La Carta's overall vibe more, but this place suits upper QA quite well.If you've been to La Carta (their other restaurant in Ballard), you can expect similar quality, dishes, drinks, decor.Good stuff. Mezcaleria deserves to do well.
Seriously, how do you mess up pizza? This place has found a way to do it. I have had a lot of mediocre pizza in my time on this earth.....but hands down awful? Mad pizza may be a first.Good salads...but the absolute worst pizza I have ever eaten. I always ask for my pizza well done. This came half way raw, with the toppings thrown on top - the cheese was not even melted.The ingredients are high quality but who cares when it tastes like garbage? Worst pizza sauce I have ever had. &#160;Nearly inedible.I am compelled to urge you to eat elsewhere! When I walked in last night to spend 21.00 on a small pizza!!!!! The employee acted like I just interrupted his leisure time. Not only is the pizza extremely over priced but the workers seem to think they're not there to do a job. Why is it so hard to find decent pizza in Seattle??
The decor is cool, fun mexican place. The area in Queen Anne has quite a few bars close by. The mojito I had was ok but the Ahi Tuna I had, I must say, was quite bad. It had a weird salty taste, and I was starving but could barely eat it. The chips and salsa were pretty good though, so I chowed down on that. I may have ordered the wrong dish. The other dish we got was steak fajitas and tasted a bit overcooked. Very average food. However, I won't complain because the waitress knocked off my dinner from our bill. Also it seems this place is packed with men, is the ratio in Seattle in women's favor? I would say go for the drinks and a fun time, not for the food though. We went to Pesos today and missed happy hour by 15 mins :( No big d though, we didn't have to wait for a table. Service was quick, we ordered and our food was there before I could ask Jor how his day was. I had asked for the pico on the side and when it came on the steak tacos, the took it back without making me feel bad, which was nice. Jordan had the pear salad. Both were good.One thing, is that they kinda trick you. I ordered the tacos and she said do you want rice and beans, and I said just beans and ended up having to pay 2.50, which is a rip off. She made it sound like it came with the meal but oh well. I'd return! Besides one bitchy waitress who I think was just new I had the best time at peso's. We got in there pretty tipsy and needed some fuel to sober up and make the drive home and it was incredible. Calamari was my fav, and the nachos were bomb.  My favorite part, our bill was 17 dollars with a manny's and 3 appetizers for the happy hour. That's killer. Although, we went in with the drunchies, I feel that sober, peso's will deliver. My boyfriend and I got into our hotel across the street at around 11pm and, hailing from SoCal, expected to be S.O.L. in terms of finding decent food at that hour. Our concierge pointed us over to Peso's, who served until 1:30 (?) to our surprise. Wow this place has some awesome atmosphere. It's all Dia de la Muerta-themed - very dark and completely candle-lit aside from some cool dimmed hanging lights, skeleton chandeliers, and a really neat bar. Someone put a lot of work into this place. We ordered 5 or 6 tapas dishes (not such small plates) and a couple of beers and were definitely sitting happy and full when we were done. The food is not fantastic, but definitely good for the price. Every dish (they have two happy hours, one early and one late) was about $4-$6. The only complaint I had was the service. One girl purposefully ignored us when we walked in, and our server was definitely nicer, but did forget our order. Also the crowd and the music was a little...how do I say this...douchebaggish? But I was almost too awestruck by the decor to notice... The wait staff are really bitchy as if they would rather be doing something else, and I encourage that they do because their service has been of no service to me!However, the eggs benedict in the morning is really good and I have always liked the location and atmosphere. I went there on a Sunday morning. &#160;Well, was kind of told to go there by a friend. &#160;The crowd was young and fairly annoying, but the drinks were good and the bartender was cool.I order some carnitas and it SUCKED! &#160;It was chunks of pork in kind of sweetish sauce (was that cinnamon?) &#160;I like my carnitas shredded and boiled in lard, not done up like some health food plate. &#160;Anyway, not at all what I'm used to and not very good. &#160;My friend liked her eggs though. &#160;I thought it was funny that on the same menu they had "eggs" and "huevos" for various dishes. &#160;Maybe not on purpose, but I thought it was funny anyhow. Great place for people who live outside Seattle to "come in to the big city". Food isn't anything special, breakfast is ok. I've been here once for lunch; it was really good and memorable, an interesting menu with fresh ingredients, and more exotic choices then your run of the mill mexican.I've atempted to go back a couple of times, however the place gets so crowded in the evenings its a joke to think you could even squeeze in. Its rumored this place turns into quite the meat market on select evenings; not really my scene at this point in my life as married pregnant chicks are not really in the "in" crowd.Too bad or I'd frequent more often! This place is my favourite Mexican joint so far....being from the UK, we are not seasoned Mexican food critics so I am new to this game. However, I sure have made the most of the culinary delights my new home has to offer and this is one of them.The place is always lively, the staff are excellent and I love love love the food! Go. You will like it. YUMMMMMMMMY YUM YUM YUMBeen here twice so far.. &#160;and the atmosphere is cool. Check out their BREAKFAST MENU! &#160;This place is bomb that's all I can say, I thank my friends for telling me about this place...Will probably add more to this as I keep going there to eat.lol The girls and I stopped by Peso's for our first stop on our "Drunch" (Drunk Brunch) Saturday. &#160;We had some fantastic drinks and food. &#160;The stuffed french toast (with cream cheese and strawberries) was just amazing! &#160;We scored a big table in the back away from the crowd and spent a few hours there enjoying our drinks and breakfast.If you haven't been here for brunch, you MUST go soon. Not bad! Went with a couple of friends/co-workers and had a few drinks and a few tapas plates (spicy lamb taquitos, stuffed jalepenos, and shredded pork).........tasty morsels, the beer was just like Manny's anywhere else.In other news, service was good enough and not snotty, ambiance was decent (didn't go on a weekend-wouldn't go on a weekend), and now I can say I went to Peso's.............................so.............&#173;..............Hey, I went to Peso's. I have been on a nacho kick all this week, but since I have also been running around the Film Festival, convenience &amp; location near a theater was key to my getting them. Thus, a trip to Pesos - a place which I think has GREAT food - I just usually can't stand the people who go there. Stopped in after an Uptown screening for some steak nachos (SO delicious) and a sangria. Everything was fine until the crowd started rolling in around 10pm - women shoving past me with no apology, bumping into me, and basically staring us down wondering when we were going to leave. We finally got choked out by some guy doused in cologne. Pesos, I really do love your food and your servers are nice too. I just wish you attracted a different clientele. Went here last Friday for the breakfast happy hour. &#160;That's right. &#160;You heard me correctly. &#160;Can you believe that there's a BREAKFAST HH? &#160;How awesome is that? &#160;$6 on all breakfast plates. &#160;Too bad it's only available M-F until 11am. &#160;Apparently, we weren't the only one that realized that we could take advantage of having July 3rd off and make it down There for AM happy hour. &#160;By the time we got there at 10:30, there was already a waitlist. &#160;We were sure we wouldn't get a table in time before HH is over but thanks to our kind waitress, we were able to put our orders in right at 11 AM. &#160;Sweet deal! &#160;And props to the waitress in the bar area.Anyways, about the food. &#160;I had the crab benedict which was pretty good. &#160;They give you a lot of fresh crab meats. &#160;The eggs and the hollandaise sauce were OK...I've been spoiled by really good egg benedicts so it's hard for me to compare. &#160;My 3 other friends all enjoyed their dishes as well. True to the HH spirit, they serve mimosa and Bloody Mary. &#160;Since it was the weekend of the 4th of July...I knew I had to save room in my liver for the celebration...so I guess I'll have to try their Bloody Mary next time. My boyfriend and raced to get to Peso's Wednesday before 6 to take advantage of their Happy Hour-- food only, which makes me sad and doesn't seem like a real Happy Hour. We would have welcomed a good, cold cheap beer to wash everything down with and probably would have stayed longer. Regarding food, I enjoyed my steak tacos. However, I didn't realize until i looked on their website that they have more Happy Hour food that was on the bar menu. Apparently, you have to ask for the "expanded" menu to see the sandwiches, etc. What's up with that? No me gusta.I've been coming to Peso's off and on for years, and to tell the truth I was disappointed. The place is in need of some TLC. For sure, it needs a DEEP CLEAN: the skeleton and the bottles at the top of the bar are covered in inches of dust (and probably grease). It's gross and makes me question the cleanliness of the place in general. And the women's restroom needs some help too--broken latch on the stall door (has been that way forever) and not very clean...Too bad because I used to really like this place. Peso's: &#160;The feel of a Mexican-themed frat bar, the taste of la revolucion!A fan of all things beef, I recommend the Late Night beef bites and the Breakfast Carne Asada (Mexican Steak and Eggs). &#160; At other restaurants I often order my meat rare and hope that I'll get it medium, but here I order it medium rare and get it, yes believe it or not, MEDIUM RARE.The music is obnoxiously loud, it is always packed full of creepy leering men, and the service isn't great.... you definitely suffer for the delicious food. &#160; and it is totally worth it. I've had fun the few times I went drinking at Peso's. To be honest, I don't recall eating anything, so I can't comment on that.It is pretty crowded on the weekends, and I'm not sure that it's really "my scene," anyway, but like I said, I had fun (probably in part because of the people I was with).My one complaint? &#160;One night, a friend (who, yes, was rather intoxicated) put her head down on the table. &#160;We were asked to leave. Yes, all twelve of us were kicked out. &#160;We asked if she could just leave with one of us to take her home, and we were told that no, every single one of us had to leave. That sort of annoyed me, and I haven't been back since, but it's a decent enough place. I'd be interested in going back to try the food sometime. Found the douchebags! Was forced to go here on a Friday night. Scary! OK, OK, not horrifying but def not my kind of crowd. Plus the bartender managed to be both out of it and a dick. I literally said "Can I please have a Corona, a water, chips and salsa, and whatever she's having", and he accused me of being "ambiguous." Maybe he just learned the word. Not subtracting any stars cause I'd still go here for brunch or on a weekday and the free chips and salsa are so damn good. I stayed across the street at the MarQueen hotel this past weekend and the doorman there suggested Peso's happy hour as we were looking for some food &#160;right after we first checked in. The food was excellent! I had an ahi tuna poke tostada which I dreamt about the rest of the trip. It was only $5 dollars which was amazing to me. There were two huge tostadas on the plate with possibly the tastiest dressing ever and some really amazingly delicious and fresh fish. I also had chicken tacos and my boyfriend had lamb flautas and beef tacos. We shared the bacon wrapped prawns. Everything was really good. Why is this place not getting five stars? Mainly because the service was bad. Everyone there had a serious attitude problem. Charing for chips and salsa? You must be joking? But no. Here in CA, chips and salsa flow freely at establishments such as this. And honestly, after paying the money for chips and salsa, I was really disappointed. The chips were stale and the salsa was just bad. Go for the food, don't stay for the great service cause it's not there. If it weren't for the green chile mole nachos with shredded chicken, Pesos would be getting a 2star review from me. &#160;Pesos' food is very good. &#160;The menu is well-conceived and well executed. &#160;IMHO I like the food here a thousand times better than the Matador, but I can't give Pesos any more than three stars because the service is mediocre. &#160;Admittedly, the cocktail servers have very little room to work and too many patrons to handle, but my friend and I noticed obvious lack of common sense displayed by our server. &#160;If it weren't for the more attentive manager/expediter (couldn't quite figure out his role), then we would have never gotten our food and drink.Luckily, I left with a sweet margarita buzz that made me forget that I was in the right place at the wrong time--Pesos on a Friday night. Came here for brunch on Sunday after the pride parade. With two people we were able to get seated right away. The music in here is pretty loud, but omg the food is totally worth it. First off, the salsa that they bring with the chips while you're waiting is so good. It actually has some kick!I ordered a migas dish and it was really delicious. Their menu is pretty extensive and there are a bunch of things I'd like to go back to try. My companion ordered some carnitas breakfast thing. The carnitas were mighty tasty, but the corn tortillas that came with them weren't great. Seemingly harmless Mexican restaurant by day, margarita fueled Snoop Dog jamming Greasy Horror Show by night.For those of you that are new to the term "greasy horror show," I have become quite fond of it over the past few weeks, I'll do my best to provide an accurate definition:Greasy Horror Show, noun: A group of sloppy drunk people, generally female, making fools out of themselves. Usually involves crude sexual gesturing, table dancing, and erratic emotional behavior. Often ends in blackouts and decisions that will be regretted the following day.Loved Pesos - you can't buy that kind of entertainment. Did not love my 6 AM flight home. I live two blocks away and have been to Peso's several times. Never for dinner or the late-night crowd - I wouldn't want to be in the sea of people I can see from the window. BUT, it is one of the only breakfast spots in the neighborhood, so I often set meetings there (would be great to open pre-9am). &#160;They have a huge menu and I've never been disappointed. Lunch yesterday was terrific. Yucatan Rockfish Tacos, delish! And we had two margaritas each that sent us into a surprisingly stiff buzz! I'm impressed Peso's, that means something! Thankfully i had the day off...Great to have a consistently good spot close by! I arrived at noon hoping to enjoy the awesome breakfast I keep hearing about. It indeed was great. &#160;It's wierd to be here in the day time, it's like it's a totally different place. Wait, what? Less douchebags? Dope!! &#160;There are still attractive people all around, but there were actual elderly people enjoying Bloody Marys and huevos rancheros. You really don't see people older than 38 in Peso's at night time, except for the random old creepy Trout looking for some young girls. &#160;Anyways, the hostess was very polite and friendly (besides being really cute) and told me I'd only have to wait a little bit. &#160;I had to wait for my friend to get there anyway. &#160;Had a great window seat where I could look outside and enjoy the absolutely gorgeous Seattle day. &#160;I enjoyed seeing girls jogging by in tank tops and shorts with sunglasses on. &#160;Is there any place better in the US than Seattle on a nice and sunny day? I don't think so. &#160;Our server was Meg and she was of course hot and provided great service. &#160;I ordered one of the breakfast specials, the Chorizo Scramble and it came to my table in less than 4 minutes. Wow! that's fast, thanks I was starving. &#160;I hardly ever order scrambles or omelets, but felt like changing it up and I'm glad I did it. I love the fresh and thicker-than-standard flour tortillas they provide to go with it. &#160;The flavor and seasoning is perfect, the thinly sliced ancho chiles really help the dish out with a slight hint of heat. &#160;Definitely was something that I'd order again if I saw it as a special. &#160;My only negative was that the potatoes were a bit overcooked, but were somewhat revived by a generous ketchup helping.My OJ was fresh and cold, and my friend's coffee was refilled at the right times by our server. What a great way to start off a gorgeous day, if you're in the mood for a non-plain breakfast then Peso's should definitely be on the short list. &#160;Can't hate a place with great food and Biggy Smalls playing loudly. Ahhhhh, Peso's. One of the first bars I visited when I moved to Seattle. My initial thoughts in 2006 mirror my thoughts in 2009. Outside of the center field beer garden at Safeco Field, Peso's is the Puget Sounds' biggest meat market. The food is good, but not great. The place is too small, which has kept us from even attempting to make the 4 block walk many times for fear that the wait might top 45 minutes.The service seems to lack (especially in the bar area) when you're not a part of a table full of horny UofW males... which provide the bulk of the tips to the well-endowed waitresses.If you want Mexican food, there are many other options (Cactus or Matador) where the food is better and the drinks just as plentiful. However, if you're searching for a young crowd with good food and loud-n-rowdy happy hour, Peso's is the place for you. Peso's rocks for breakfast. Last Thursday I waited over an hour to get seated, and ya I bitched a ton while I was waiting, but it was well worth it to cure my hangover and kick off the new year with a wonderful breakfast and great drinks! You MUST try the bloody mary drinks, and request it to be spicy! The make their own bloody Mary mix in house and it is the best I've had in the Seattle area. I'm a loyal fan to the carnitas with corn tortillas. They also make great eggs Benedict. You pretty much can't go wrong with anything you choose on the menu. Peso's doesn't take reservation, but the deliciousness is worth the wait! Just got back from my first happy hour here and was impressed. &#160;The place was packed but we managed to find seating no problem. &#160;Started out with two pints of Hefeweizen (forget the brewery) and the infamous chips and salsa I have heard so much about. &#160;Tastefully spicy.When it came time to order I went with the jalapeno lamb tequitos and golden fried calamari w/ jalapeno aioli. &#160;WOW! &#160;If you haven't tried it yet I highly recommend the calamari. &#160;The aioli's flavor is upper-echelon.Will definitely go back in the future. I am on a mission to find the best breakfast restaurant and Pesos has hit the top of the list. &#160;I have yet to find anything that beats their crab benedict. &#160;It's that good! &#160;The flavors of the crab and the corn salsa is pure heaven. &#160;And I have also been there for lunch and dinner. &#160;No need to look at the menu, just order the crab and shrimp enchilada. &#160;Done and done.Gracias Pesos! I was in Seattle for work over the weekend and came in for dinner with one of my co-workers. We came on a Sat night and it was extremely crowded. We got lucky and snagged a seat at one of the bar tables. The chips and salsa here are sooooo good! We ordered a carafe of the Spanish Pomegranate Sangria.....yum!! We both ordered veggie tostada salads which aren't on the menu but our waitress was super sweet and had the kitchen make them especially for us =)The salads were alright, I've had better...but after that carafe of sangria was empty I didn't really care too much. The atmosphere was lively and fun. If I'm in Seattle again I'll definitely be back! The breakfast here is simply DELICIOUS. From 9 - 11am is the breakfast happy hour where dishes are only $6 ($9 for breakfast dishes with seafood). I came here with a group of 6 and everything we got was so good! I got the classic benedict with ham and my boy got their most popular dish, the chicken-fried steak. Everything had a mexican twist to it and all of our dishes (except the french toast) came with picco de gallo, which tastes SO fresh. The hash brown potatoes here are nearly perfect. Nicely seasoned and slightly crisp! Portions are extremely generous and we even had leftovers! I HIGHLY recommend this place for breakfast! One of the best places in Seattle along with 4th Street Grill (but um it's technically in Renton, haha)I'd try and come early to beat the crowd. When we got to the restaurant at 8:54 there was a line of people waiting outside (but we were able to get a seat just fine) and when we left, there was still a line! The fajitas were decent.The margaritas were potent.The crowd was hilarity on a stick.Everyone in the bar appeared to be wearing a sign around his or her neck that read: &#160;Look at me! &#160;Love me! &#160;Notice me! &#160;Pick me!Sad. I have now been to Peso's for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and happy hour and I can say that the food is great anytime of the day. I do, however, avoid Peso's at night b/c I am not one to contribute to booty call and meat market hour. Margaritas without fail are always good. Bartenders and House Margaritas are great. I am not the biggest fan of the Cucumber and Sage Margarita, but I have friends who are, so try it and see if it fits your taste. The D' Anjou pear salad is fantastic. Happy hour includes a number of seafood dishes. I will always recommend their prawns, calamari, and crab spring rolls on their tapas menu. Brunch is crazy to die for! Had the crab omelet with cheese and veggies as well as the chicken fried steak with jalapeno corn gravy. My dish came with a side of fried potatoes that were cooked to perfection! Washed everything down with Peso's specialty Sangria, which is oh so good! Cheap happy hour Mexican food. That's a good thing but the food wasn't too great. But what can you expect from a place that's apparently the frat boy hangout of the neighborhood?However, the food did hit the spot for late-night. That's all. After watching some Shakespeare we decided Mexican food would be a good follow up. &#160;Othello takes place in Guadalajara, right??I was pretty surprised it was so crowded! &#160;It was 11 or so at night on a Tuesday and it was pretty packed. &#160;While we waited by the front door, some douche bumped into me and shoved his ID in my face. &#160;Uhh... whaaaaaaat? &#160;I can only assume he thought I worked here and was the doorman/bouncer? &#160;Hahahaha. &#160;Why even bother showing me his ID when he only flashed it.... I couldn't even tell what state it was from....Anywho, we snagged a table and looked over the menu. &#160;it was Happy Hour. &#160;It made me happy =) &#160;I ordered a Cucumber, Sage Margarita because it sounded interesting.... and it was. &#160;I'm not sure if I'd ever order another one, but I enjoyed it. &#160;Very unique and flavorful and while the cucumber did make it light and refreshing, the strong sage after taste made it sort of heavy. &#160;For food we had the Nachos, Halibut Tacos, Seared Ahi and Crab and Avocado Spring Rolls. &#160;The Crab and Avocado Spring Rolls was my favorite. &#160;Full of crab and Avocado, freshly fried, perfectly crispy and hot. &#160;Yummmm. &#160;I have no idea what the brownish sauce that was served with it was, but it was yummy. &#160;The Seared Ahi was cooked well, extremely tender, and was served on a "creamed corn sauce" (so said our server). &#160;I'm not at all used to Tex-Mex style Ahi, but it was yummy. &#160;The Nachos were fine as were the tacos. &#160;Forgettable, but fine. &#160;The prices were good for the quality of food and service was pretty darn attentive.... my water glass was always full and I was crazy thirsty that night. &#160;My one complaint (and this will make me sound really old) is that the music was really loud. &#160;Like club loud, except no one was dancing. &#160;I don't understand why it was so loud! &#160;Loud music aside, it was a fun time! I've been coming here for about 8 years since I turned 21. When I first turned 21 in 2002, we would come to this place every weekend. Awesome drinks, fabulous atmosphere, retarded good happy hour. Seriously back then this was the only place in the city where you could get steak tacos, 7 layer Nachos, black sea scalops and calamari for three dollars a piece. Four friends and I would absolutely fill the table with food and when the tab comes its always a pleasant surprise. Awesome music. Wu Tang Clan, Out kast, Mickey Avalon, Two Live Crew, &#160;whatever you need to keep your night cruising right along. The people here are always in a good mood. To the bar for jeager bombs all the way till the end of the night. One thirty o clock the lights go on and its over to dicks.. to shut the night down. You know what else is awesome about this place, "The Hang Over Breakfast." On sat and sun morning they serve the most bitchingest breakfast in the city with a spanish twist. Huevos Rancheros, Breakfast burritos, cafe vita coffee and a Diablo bloody Mary. This will cure any hangover faster than you can say Pedia Lite. We love to come to this place early in the morning before heading to Seahawk Home games at 1. This is a night spot, happy hour hang out, breakfast joint all in one and you know what the food is god damn awesome. So Awesome that the matador which sprung up after pesos was able to open 2-3 sucessful locations based on the pesos model. Pesos you were and always will be the original. Thank you for providing me with 8 years of good times. I LOVE PESOS. For drinks, for dinner, anything really. Lovely environment and great staff... they have an awesome happy hour menu also. Their nachos are out of this world. It was my Birthday, so my buddy and I decided we would just eat food all day. Great excuse, right? So after a long day window shopping at northgate, we ended up at pesos. Absolutely beautiful decor! It was truly stunning in there. &#160;Our server seemed slightly irritated with us as we were overwhelmed by the 4$ appetizers &#160;and couldn't decide. They all sounded delicious! Yeah, they were weird. Like, not mexican at all weird! The steak quesadillas came with au jus which was really tasty &#160;but I thought it was &#160;strange. &#160;Then we got some bacon wrapped jalapeno peppers with some goat cheese filling. Sounded lovely but tasted like death. Thank god she took it off the bill. &#160;all in all the service was okay. It was an okay experience. This place is good. The food is great- chips and salsa are a staple. My only beef is having a happy hour and not having any drink specials. yeah the food is cheap but if a can of Tecate is almost $5- where's the value.Our server (Shelby?) was fantastic. Helpful, attentive, friendly and knew the menu.This palce is always busy so expect a wait for a table.Have not tried breakfast yet but I hear it's great. I'm not a fan of the abundant post-college, I-don't-know-what-to-do-with-my-life-so-I'm-going-&#173;to-come-here-every-Friday crowds. But you know, sometimes the food is just amazing and well-done, and Pesos is one of those places.My favorite dish is the biscuits and habanero gravy. It's just absolutely to die for and the portions are huge. One time I came here and the waiter forgot to put in our order, so after 45 long years...err minutes, we said something and we got our meal for free (of course). Despite that horrendous experience, I'll keep coming back because the food is laced with some addictive stimulant. Haven't been here since I lived in Seattle for college (until 2005), so this review probably isnt too up to date, but i did recommend it to a friend who lived in seattle this past summer and it sounds like its still pretty much the same...loved the decor, loved the drinks (back when i liked margaritas), loved the chop chop salad (minus bacon), and loved coming here on friday or saturday nights! also, i love queen anne, and when i almost moved back to seattle this month, this would have been somewhere i'd probably frequent again! Pesos is my favorite place to go for happy hour. They don't have any drink specials, but their food specials are worth it! The best fish tacos in Seattle for only $5!! Totally worth it.I wouldn't venture here too late because you'll get bombarded with party girls. If you're there for the food, get there between 4-6 pm and you won't regret it! Well unfortunately my plan of getting my married friends into a Sunday worship carnal threesome due to numerous bloody marys &amp; mimosas never came to fruition. &#160;Damn you to hell, Peso's!However Peso's did fill me up with some yummy grub, and finely made spicy BM's. &#160;Great Sunday brunch atmosphere, cause you can tell half the people stayed up too late when they got there. &#160;Plus it's got that Victorian Spanish look going on the inside.The choice of the day was omelets for us and eggs Florentine. &#160;The veggie omelet was good, but the hash browns were better. &#160;And I usually rate a place on its sauces (be them alcoholic or not), and Peso has got a hella good Hollandaise sauce cookin'.Also, if you're feeling &#160;a good buzz when you walk out the door &amp; take a right, then take the time to spin the carousel horsey that is part of the ironwork adorning the outer windows. &#160;If nothing else you'll get a kick out the severe envy of iron things that you create in passing pedestrians. Well, what can I say. &#160; The decor is unique, the food is also unique, kind of a fusion and creative. &#160;Love the breakfast on a weekend after a night of drinking and debauchery. This was the happening place Saturday night when I was in the area. Most other places were half full but it was packed here. Most people were dressed nice and looking good . Too bad I didn't have more time to stay. This place has consistently good food! Great Margaritas. Can get bit loud.. and the crowd is always interesting... everything from the average cougar- to the married guy with a permanent dent from his ring that is now in his coat pocket, to folks like me who live walking distance away and just want a good meal and good drinks. Interesting how we are in the middle of 'recession' and there is always a line! Ha... anyways.. OH breakfasts you can't go wrong. When I went here, it was pretty busy. &#160;It was our second night in Seattle and for a Wednesday night the place was much busier than we expected - we actually had to wait. &#160;The bar was also full.I wouldn't say it was the most fantastic Mexican food ever, but it was definitely good. &#160;They also give you free chips and salsa - and let me tell you - the salsa is spicy and great. I've been there a couple of times. Once last Thursday. It was great!The waitress was terrific - she said she'd been there like 10 years. She was polite, made good menu recommendations and had our table well taken care of.The bar filled up fast and people genuinely looked to be having a good time. My nephew knows the owner. I met him on my first visit. Nice guy. He's doing a good job. Breakfast / BrunchI was a fan of the food. Every neighborhood has the standard-quality Mexican place, and Peso's is LQA's. &#160;Hooray! &#160;The food is pretty good, the drinks are pretty good, the service is pretty good. &#160;I can't say that I was blown away by any part of it, but the portions are ample. In fact, i got an appetizer and an entree and even after splitting some of it with a friend I ate waaaay too much. &#160;It hurts just thinking about it actually. &#160;Gross.To be fair, the presentation of the meal was very good, and I'm a well-known vocal supporter of leaving a bottle of water on the table so you can refill your own drink. &#160;So there's that.I think the most noteworthy feature of Peso's is the decor. &#160;Great color choices and good atmospheric lighting make it a very inoffensive place to eat (and drink, presumably). &#160;I'd say 'bueno', but not 'muy bueno'. &#160;I'd also sound really patronizing because that's the extent of my Spanish. &#160;Hasta la vista. Pesos is one of my favorite places to hang out in Seattle. &#160;Coming from Los Angeles this past September, I was really sceptical about the Seattle night life. &#160;Thursday nights are awesome with great music, awesome employees, and great food. &#160;I recommend trying their Sangria and their Beef Bites (my favorite appetizer in Seattle).PESOS KICKS ASS!!!! Went there this morning and showed up a few minutes before my friends because they were parking. &#160;I asked for a table for 3 and I was told I would have to wait for my friends to show up before she would seat me. &#160;There was only one table left in the place. &#160;If I would have said table for 1, they would have sat me there. &#160;Guess I should have said that. &#160;Three groups came in within the 10 minutes it took for my friends to show up. &#160;So we had to wait. &#160;The other tables that came in before me got their name on the list before I did. &#160;I was absolutely furious. &#160;I have never had a restaurant not seat me because everyone wasn't there. &#160;Especially when there was only one table left in the place and they would have had to seat me there ANYWAY!Minus 2 stars for this bullshit. &#160;I would never go back there but their breakfast is so fucking good, I'll put up with it.Elitist pissants.Back again today, for happy hour. &#160;Mind you I never get IDed at this place because I'm 30 and old looking. &#160;Well, I get IDed today and apparently my ID had expired a few days ago on my birthday. &#160;I was kicked out rudely. &#160;Fuck I'm in a bad mood now... My friend took me here during my visit to Washington. &#160;The happy hour prices for food were competitive and the food was solid. Try the chile rellenos! &#160; However, the mojitos and sangria left something to be desired. &#160;Maybe I am spoiled with great mojitos and sangrias because I am from Los Angeles. Also, this place is good for groups under six. Anything larger they frown upon.The atmosphere is fun and the music is ecclectic. &#160;I've never been in a bar that plays sublime and michael jackson in the same set. Great variety.Would go here again. Definitely the best chicken fajitas I've ever had. &#160;They were served sizzling to perfection and oh-so-seasoned. &#160;yummy!!! &#160;And the Cazadores Margarita was on-point! &#160;After a long day it hit the spot. &#160;The chips and salsa were a nice start to the meal, and the salsa has a nice kick.I sat in the back bar where it's dimly lit and with mini overhead lights. &#160;Cool atmosphere and hip staff. Peso's has a good breakfast and great margarita's.It's not a good place to go at night because it gets way to loud (can't talk to the person sitting next to you let alone someone at the other side of a table) and the waitstaff can be very slow. I would give it 4 or 5 stars for my breakfast experiences at it but the times that I have come at night have left a bad taste in my mouth. I had always gone to Peso's for drinks in the evening but then last month I went there for breakfast, by far the best breakfast I have ever tasted and have been telling everyone I know to try them out. I had the crab omelet with holiday sauce on it. WOW. Try it out for breakfast! I don't love to go here at night...but for my money, one of the best brunch things in the city. Huge menu and everything I have ever had for breakfast has been really good! Ok - I am spoiled for good Mexican food from close to the border in Texas, California and Arizona - but seriously, this was very mediocre food. &#160;Tortillas around tacos were cold - chips were very greasy. "Avocado" on tacos was processed "guacamole" - had to scrape it off. Only plus was Dos Equis on tap I am from New Mexico and I love how this place does Mexican. I felt like I was in Baja California. There were fish tacos, yummy enchiladas and drinks. The prices on the food were great. Went here with my better half on Sunday after taking a walk around Green Lake...I've been told to check out Peso's for breakfast from my sister and a couple of my friends...and we finally went. &#160;This review is based only on their breakfast.When we received our menus from the server, we were in shock...rarely have we ever been to a place where every single menu item was "orderable". &#160;I wanted to try their most popular or signature dish and the server told me that their Carne Asada w/Eggs and Chicken Fried Steak were their signature items. She also told me that their "Benedict's" were popular as well. Our server was very friendly and fast. &#160;The restaurant wasn't too busy since we arrived a little after 9am. &#160; I ended up ordering the Chicken Fried Steak with the Jalepeno-Corn Gravy and my better half ordered the Crab Omelette with Hollandaise sauce and Asparagus. &#160;Price-wise, it cost a little more than what you would normally pay for a traditional breakfast but it was worth it in our opinion &#160;I also ordered a glass of their freshly squeezed orange juice, which was very good too. &#160;Both of our meals came with home fries and a side of pico de gallo. &#160;With my chicken fried steak, I requested my eggs over easy. &#160;The jalapeno corn gravy was simply amazing. &#160;The color of the gravy was a light brown color with hints of green in it from the jalapenos...with pieces of corn kernels mixed around. &#160;The sauce was very creamy and had a good spice to it...the jalapenos definitely gave the gravy a little kick. &#160;The chicken fried steak was nicely breaded and flavorful. &#160;I can see myself ordering this again. &#160;My better half's meal was equally delicious. &#160;She had an egg omelette with hollandaise sauce on top and in the middle, it is stuffed full of dungeness crab...there was also asparagus on the bottom of the omelette. &#160;She told me that this was the best omelette she has ever had. &#160;Overall, I can easily say that this restaurant deserves to be on everyone's list for breakfast. &#160;I'm already looking forward in trying out their Carne Asada w/Eggs... This place is always fun. Cinco de mayo is going to be great, just like it was last year. Best of all Peso's doesn't attract the normal Seattle crowd, thank god. Those losers are better off staying up in Capital Hill drinking dark beers and wearing flannel shirts. The food is good, the service is great and besides an occasional Subaru driving Seattleite that comes in to complain, the crowd is great too. I recommend this place for both dinner and socializing. If you happen to be good looking you'll feel right at home but Peso's doesn't discriminate, uglies are allowed in too. While I am not going to rave about Pesos, I do need to get one thing straight. They do have good food. I don't know what is wrong with your taste buds Miki T., but the food here is way better than taco bell. And as for everything being fried... THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ORDER ALL FRIED ITEMS!!! The Happy Hour Menu Does offer Soups, Sandwiches, salads, fresh poke, lettuce cups, tacos, etc. So don't hand out a poor review due to you lack of ordering skill.Now on to the rest of my thoughts... Strange Bartender. Wasn't rude or anything, but was just a bit weird. I suppose you would expect an outgoing friendly person behind the bar in a place of this caliber. We ordered a blanco tequila, and since it is so friggin dark in the back area, I couldn't really tell in had the amber color of a reposado. Then when ordering a second, he realized that we had originally ordered the blanco. We recieved the blanco this time. Great!Bill comes:Reposado (2@$14)=$28Blanco (2@$11)=$22C'mon Man! Don't charge us for something we didn't order! Thats customer service 101... I would have made it up in gratuity anyway! And to finish, Jenn P is right. The Skeleton does have a hairy fuzz on it. I thought at first, &#160;it was part of the "Dia De Los Muertos" theme, but after further inspection, it was just the collection of lint and stuff on a greasy piece of art. Someone please!- Ownership, manager, bartender, server... Please clean the fuzz of that damn skeleton! I love the Happy Hour and drinks! &#160;The bartenders are great and I always have a good time! &#160;I"ll be there tomorrow for Cinco de Mayo!!! I have been here several more times since my last review. I am upping to 5 stars because I've never had a bad experience here. The food is always good, my margarita is always strong, and the service is always great. The last time I was there they had a larger happy hour menu...not sure if that's a new addition but I love it! Even more cheap food! I liked it ok, the guacamole was divine and the meal was pretty good (I had encheladas) and the decor pleasant enough. &#160;It was a busy Friday night but our food came quickly and it wasn't too crazy. &#160;They charge alot for a side of guacamole but it really was super good. A &#160;year ago, I totally would have given this place four or five stars for one reason and one reason alone...their hanger steak nachos. &#160;You can get drinks anywhere, the food though...the food. &#160;Returning the other day for these fantastic nachos my order yielded what looked like a third of the size they used to serve...but for the same price. &#160;Super sub par. &#160;If you are going to scale back the size and quality you might as well scale back the price. &#160;Nachos were meant to be piled high... in fact, the higher the nachos the higher the rating!Their other steak items however were still fantastic... what is that marinade!? $6 breakfast happy hour! Had carne asada and eggs... steak was cooked perfectly, as were the eggs. Potatoes were OK and I think I would have rather had some tortillas with it instead. Next time will try the migas. I've been looking for a place that serves mexican style breakfast at breakfast time... this is it. Very good for brunch, although the place is a little noisy the vast demographic that makes a early morning weekend crawl into the restaurant is a fantastic spectacle. Seattle has officially soured me moreso on the late night food scene in Orange County (if that were possible) and it did it in a dazzling way.Upon my denial from Canada (BASTARDS!), my girl and I redirected into Seattle and found ourselves a hotel, which was directly across the street from Peso's... so we strolled in there more out of hunger and lack of options than high anticipation.Upon entering, I was not very thrilled with the two girls who aptly ignored that there was anyone standing at the door; especially after one looked right at us, turned her back and didn't acknowledge us the rest of the time we stood there.After finally being seated, we marveled at the very ghastly, ghoulish decor (in a good way) that transplanted me into either a Tim Burton film or a Gomez Addam's owned tapas bar. In fact, due to its Tapas theme and obvious Spanish influence... we'll call this the Guillermo Del Toro bar... the Pan's Labyrinth of Seattle, if you will. The wooden bar is impressively and darkly grandiose and its muerta-ornate decor meshed with the well-developed skeleton chandeliers and candle-lit taupe walls does create for the single coolest bar I've ever been in, tied with SF's Bourbon and Branch. If only the clientele was equally as unique... I felt like I was transplanted back into LA's douchebag culture with tight-shirted, steroid-injected bros and Puma-aged (expletive-deleted word for "loose woman") traipsing around with their fake tits under kid's shirts. Not my style. Like Phoenix, only gloomy and gray.The food is something to attest for and that's why this place receives its three stars... I'm usually not much one to rule on clientele; however, it was so overburdening at this place that it loses a star for it, another two for service and gains one back for the decor and the food, which is ridiculously well-priced and very tasty. Big dishes for $4. A transplanted, decorative experience, good beer and cheap flavorful food does make this a place you should probably check out if in Seattle. I just warn you now, depending on your persons preference, you'll either love this place or spend your night scoffing back at the bitches and dude bros scoffing at you. For me, by far, the best breakfast meal you can get in Seattle. &#160;I LOVE Mexican food and this feels like home when it comes to b-fast. &#160;I am a Seattle-ite who spent his Summers in Mexico at a cabin and however this is neuvo-Mexicana this is the best you can get in the AM. &#160;Do yourself a favor and get in here for breakfast and their AMAZING El Diablo Bloody Marys. One way to know your at Peso's and not the Matador is the food....it's better at Peso's. So I adore the food, the cute bartenders, and the margaritas that they just keep bringing. They have a great breakfast, and the happy hour menu is great. Here's what I don't like.....the Friday-Saturday night bridge and tunnel 20 somethings that turn this place into a crazy meat market. mmmmm feeling under-dressed now that your boobs and ass aren't hanging out???? Hopefully by the time they show up: 1. I have a seat at the bar 2. I'm too drunk to notice them. So I recommend when the meat market crowd shows up...walk down to Spectator.... ahhh much better. Went here for breakfast HH a week ago and showed up at 11:01 AM, but our server still gave us the happy hour prices! I got the garden scramble, which was deliciously mushroomy and cheesy, but maybe a little too heavy for so early in the day. It came with potatoes which were pretty tasty. My boyfriend got the stuffed french toast and it was a little too sweet, but overall pretty good. I think between the two of us, we had a good balance. I wasn't too impressed with my visit, but I'll definitely give it a go again. A friend of mine from Seattle brought me here when I was visiting out of town. It was awesome - huge portions, great price, really good food, nice ambiance. I've been a couple of times since moving here (I live just down the street). It's never quite lived up to the first time, but it never disappoints. Wow, we loved it. We were seated in the "hot waitress section" I believe...as our waitress was pretty hot. AND she was nice! Food was all tasty...crab benedict was the standout...and my boyfriend loved all the music they played. It's obvious this place is trying to be "hip"...but who cares? The food is really good...and service was adequate. Very cool place and the food is fantastic. They also make killer margaritas. The place almost turns into a nightclub after 10pm which made me feel really old. ;-) The music gets louder and louder and you start to drink more and more! Love the happy hour.The food and everything was good..but the way the waitress treated us was rude. It was a 50/50 experience. I came in a group and everyone was excited to eat and get drinks. &#160;Our waitress asked us if we wanted anything to eat and we said we will get drinks and order when its happy hour....we were about 20 till happy hour. &#160;She gave us rude looks and her tone of voice was inappropiate. &#160;Then my friend called her out and they were both arguing about her service. &#160;She called my friend a b*tch . &#160;After that my friend demanded to talk to her manager. &#160;I do not like sitting and watching people argue back and forth. &#160;Everyone is just trying to have and good time. Then when we recieved our bill...we did not want to tip her and since there was already gratuity added...my friend talked to the manager and told him that she does not deserve a tip for treating her like crap. So it is a meat market, but I do love this place - especially breakfast (which helps if you would rather enjoy your food than get hit on). &#160;Seriously though the Carne Asada here is delicious and the margaritas are too - yes breakfast margaritas. &#160;Happy hour here offers a solid menu at cheap prices. &#160;Pesos is one place you want to hate, but it keeps you coming back for more :) I don't come here during the night hours, because it's just such an odd crowd. &#160;However, you'll definitely find me taking advantage of the happy hour breakfast. &#160;Every morning until 11am, breakfast is $6-9 (even though breakfast is served until 2pm), and completely out of this world delicious. &#160;The crab benedict with avocado is amazing beyond belief, and the potatoes are perfectly crispy and seasoned. &#160;The staff is also top notch--from the servers to bartenders...they're great! Still okay for breakfast, but I finally went here on a Friday night and it was absolutely filthy with douchebags. &#160;I guess it's no worse than anywhere in Fremont, so if you don't mind that then knock yourself out. &#160;I miss my Ballard dives. Loved the New York steak with a side of the garlic shrimp. Just amazingly good. The steak was cooked perfect to medium rare, had a rich butter taste and the garlic shrimp was just garlicky enough. The side of beans and rice were great as well with the fresh corn tortillas. Loved it all. Oh, Pesos, you could have had so many more stars but for the breakfast. It's horrible. All the egg dishes are the same, just organized differently on the plate. And how can you make Andouille gross? I had the breakfast tacos with Andouille sausage and it was uninspired and boring. And if the wait is going to be an hour, please tell me--don't say it's going to take 30 minutes. Then I can make a decision. The only reason it got two stars is because I did have a pretty good lunch there. Pesos may not need another review, as they seem to have plenty-- however, I've been working through a list of places and this one is definitely on it. Pesos sticks in your head and makes you want to keep going back. The food is really good. It reminds me of San Diego mexican food (vs the kind we get for the most part in Denver...baha vs texmexy). The fish tacos, the carne asada, the shrimp, the nachos, the salsa, and the margaritas are all excellent. The service has never been spectacular, but its always been interesting. There are a lot of eye catching servers, that's for sure. Pesos can be very dancy and almost turns into a club scene at night (although I've only been there on week nights and never weekends, which I'm sure are even more rowdy). On Cinco de Mayo, the line to get in wrapped around the block--it can get crowded. &#160;In summary, the food and margaritas are noteworthy, the music is fun, the company has always been "fun", and I'd highly recommend Pesos if you are looking for a lunch, happy hour or dinner place that is unique and never dull.
Quite simply the best effing noodles you will ever put in your mouth. Go there now. Buy me a beer. Best pho around in the city. Awsome broth, fresh meat. And the fried roll is amazing. Hard to find a pho that has good broth and a lot of vegetables, herbs in it. &#160;This was bland and customer service was slow. &#160;Hence the 2 star. Lovely atmosphere, but the the pho was disappointingly bland and the prices were a little high for the quality. Would probably rather try some of the other restaurants next door if I'm in the neighborhood again, and stick to Than Brothers for my pho needs. A little expensive but good food. I enjoy the spicy broth pho and extra noodle is free so I always get that. Fresh rolls - although expensive, are great. Diappointing. &#160;I wanted to support Pho Viet Anh because I was recently disappointed by a new vietnamese soup cafe which recently opened up in QA. I ordered the beef strips with vermicelli noodles. &#160;The beef slices were almost the length of my palm. &#160;The American palate think they want this kind of preparation? &#160;Twice I could not swallow the meat. &#160;I took a picture, but opted not to share because it looked to disgusting. &#160;Second, I ordered a bowl of soup-simple with broccoli and snow peas-hold the carrots. &#160;No snow peas in sight and the broth was the pho broth. &#160;I did not order vegetarian pho soup. &#160;On a positive note, the waitress was very nice to a family who stopped in to use the restroom. &#160;Without hesitation, she graciously directed the entire family to the restrooms. &#160;I will return and try Pho Anh, again. Pretty generic as far a pho goes. The broth was nothing to get excited about and the condiments seemed on the other side of fresh. The spring rolls were also lacking with somewhat tough rappers and all-in-all not packing much flavor. Service was fine, but there are definitely better bowls of pho to be had. I just got back from lunch here and I was pleased. &#160;It has a fun, clean decor but it's pretty dark inside (even on a sunny day) and the Musak was killing me! &#160;The pho was good and I enjoyed the spicey broth but the selection was limited. &#160;None of the more adventurous stuff like tendon or tripe. &#160;I'd go back but not before Than Bros if I was closer. &#160;$8 for a large is on the high end of the price scale. Pho Viet Anh, is fast, delicious, and affordable. Enough said? We were looking for a quick and convenient eatery before we dashed to make the Opera. &#160;Pho Viet Anh is situated on a neighboring corner outside Seattle Opera - about as convenient as one can get. And the meal service was dashingly quick!Let me scream "Novice Alert!" Outside of my Aunt's Vietnamese cooking, of which I have had relatively little, Paramour has taken me to two Vietnamese restaurants, one in Denver Co, where our dish was something entirely different than what I experienced at Pho Viet Anh -- &#160;this place was a delight for my taste buds!I had Curry Chicken with Rice Noodles served up in a bowl.My curry was savory enough to make me want to lick the bowl clean! And at the same time it was not overwhelmingly curried. The carrots still had body (not mushed) and the noodles - well my inexperienced taste buds were delighted - I could have cared less if there was chicken - which there was a plenty soaking in the curry sauce (and not overly cooked - kudos to the cook)The place is tiny, with tables so close you bump elbows with your neighboring table. Definitely not a "finer dining" establishment -- it was cozy and clean (but then I did not peek into the bathrooms or the kitchen - yikes) and, a roaring "YAY," there was NO carpet on the floor (one of my pet peeves)!I would say this place would work for kids, its noise - so your kids will blend right in; food service is FAST - so they won't have time to get bored. So yes, its kid-friendly...Now I have two entirely different savory treats for my pre-Opera dining. Pho Viet Anh and the Ethiopian joint whose name escapes me presently... (note to self: remember name and write experience review) I wish this place existed in the SF peninsula. We went on a small 3 day vacation to Seattle a few weeks ago. On our 2nd day, We needed some good grub that wasnt fast food or burger type grub. While looking for parking around Seattle Center, We spotted this little spot. My wife immediately spots the word "PHO" and starts screaming like a little girl at a Jonas Brothers concert.The place looks real small and unassuming on the outside. When we walk in, It is completely packed. We were served real quickly. My wife ordered the Chicken PHO and I get the Chicken Bun. So mutha***kin good. Everything about the food was amazing. It filled the spot completely and all at very reasonable prices. It was so good, We went back the next day, knowing we had to catch a flight back on Monday at 6am. Again, Delightful food, Quick &amp; friendly service. Highly recommended. We cant wait to go back. Lemon Grass Onion Chicken nooodles. BEST. Pho Viet Anh is in the space of the rotating Asian restaurant. Over the last ten years, that space was home to at least two other Asian restaurants. Those restaurants were so-so. Pho Viet Anh is a refreshing exception. Finally, decent pho in Queen Anne/Downtown area. The veggie pho is great, and you can get fresh tofu instead of fried tofu in there. Also a nice mix of vegetables to go with that. Spring rolls are also delicious. The restaurant is a little expensive for "fast food" but it's decent price for the neighborhood. The decor is also snazzy enough that you could go here for a nice meal before a Seattle Center event. Love it! Quick, cheap. White meat chicken. Even the steak is good. Veggie fresh rolls are yummy too! I'm a huge fan! Closes at 8pm daily. The reason we liked this place so much is that it reminded us of Vietnam. Pho Viet Anh isn't fancy by any means, but the food we had was pretty darn good, which is typical Vietnam. We had spring rolls to start then rice vermecelli bowls with pork for a total of $23. Not bad for a filling dinner in Queen Anne. We'll definitely be back. I just got into Seattle and my previous dining experience has been horrible excluding mike's. but today I'm happy to say there has been a place that made me smile.I was discourage when i went inside and it looked fancy. then seeing that they have 4 broths. A traditional one, some spicy one that I'm not sure about, chicken and vegetarian.What really caught me off guard was they had the cuts of meat that i enjoy. The last time i was able to get it done right was San Jose.Service was polite and friendly and i do apologize to the folks in there, i was singing along to their elevator music. :) Even though it was over 90 degrees last night my friends and I decided we were in the mood for Vietnamese food and to me Vietnamese food means pho! &#160;I'd been to Pho Viet Ahn one time previously and was happy with the basic pho with beef broth. &#160;I decided this time to try their Hot and Spicy broth which had flavors of lemongrass and ginger...a really interesting take on a basic broth. &#160;i ordered it with the standard brisket and within 5 minutes my pho was on the table. &#160;This pho comes with the standard fixings of been sprouts, basil, jalepeno, lime, and or course sriracha. &#160;The hot and spicy broth is what makes this pho special and it was certainly better than the basic beef broth that I had the last time I went to Pho Viet Ahn. &#160;Overall I think the food is good, the service is fast, and it's conveniently located for those who live in Belltown and Queen Anne. Kind of leaning towards pricey when it comes to pho... The other stuff is ok. There's nothing about this place that makes it really memorable. The service was eh. The food was eh. Not a diverse crowd. The pho was almost bland.Go there... don't go there... It's ok. This is a good choice for reasonably priced delicious pho. For entrees, I have only had the chicken pho and tofu pho in chicken broth, but have been impressed with each. The broth is particularly good, with full flavor that is not overpowering or too salty. The sprouts/basil were very fresh as well. Their fresh spring rolls are good, which is the best thing I can say about any spring roll. All in all, this is a great option in lower Queen Anne on a cold rainy night. Let's Get Pho'd UpNo really. Let's get pho'd up at my favorite new (to me) restaurant.The interiors actually resemble a real restaurant, they serve yummy egg and spring rolls, and last but not least, really really good f-ing pho! What makes Pho Viet Anh stand out from the rest is their variety of broth. Their spicy broth deserves an honorable mention because it's tangy, spicy, and full of flavor.Don't fret if you're more of a traditional pho kind of guy yourself. Their regular beef broth is just as tastilicious.
This was only based off one visit &#160;for dim sum as we were passing through the area.Food was decent, and not too bad. It would definitely fill your dim sum needs. Variety was decent also. Service was excellent for a Chinese restaurant. Well, maybe people in Seattle are just nicer all around, but definitely hospitable and will go the extra mile for you. That in itself is hard to find in dim sum houses around the world. Prices were more than decent. Quite inexpensive actually. Less than anything we've ever paid, and we were more than adequately stuffed. by the way, bathrooms were clean also. Great variety for dim sum, especially for not even being in the ID. They had a congee cart, a steamed cart, a baked cart and a dessert cart making the rounds.The carts came through quickly, and actually came back to offer seconds. The ladies were a little pushy, but not too bad. And all of the food was actually hot!Prices are fair too - nine plates cost $30. My family and I were on our way to our usual dim sum at joy palace, but we figured we should try something new. So hk seafood was on the way.. All in all, the business was a lil slow, although we were there around 1130. The staff was friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, I think the reason why they were friendly is because we spoke the language. Anyways we ordered the shui mai (ok), chicken feet (awesome, tender/soft like butter), spare ribs (ok, not as tender as i'd hope), bean curd wrap (ok), the deep fried tofu with the shrimp on top (disappointment! 1)not enough sauce 2)lack of flavor with that minimal sauce; all in all, Im complaining about not having enough flavorless sauce) and some other things I cannot interpret into english. None the less the food was hot , it wasnt joy palace or jade garden but it was enough. We were full with a bunch of left overs but we had to get egg tart!The egg tart was yummy! Although, i'd say the tart n egg ratio isnt on the spot. I dont think theres enough egg &#160;The bill came out to be 31 n some odd change. Not bad, we'll be back. I tend to only leave reviews when I'm upset or very happy... And I judge the stars based on the quality of the food more-so than the service and atmosphere.My sister and I went late at night. At about 9 (they close at 10) and they do dim sum all day. While we were there, they were only taking orders. That was great though, everything was very fresh. They brought things out as they finished so that we got everything hot. It was good. I'm not usually a big fan of shuy mai but theirs is delicious. By far the best I've had to date. All of the shrimp dumplings (steamed and fried) had great flavor and texture. Nothing tasted like it had a bunch of filler products to cost less. (whether it does or not, I don't know, but everything was very good). There are certainly a few things we will try when we go back. Because we will most definitely be back soon! :) I don't really have a favorite dimsum place. I like dimsum house in renton. this was good. They just seem to bombard you with everything and don't listen.the food was good though. they are pretty authentic and they are pretty fresh. I would probably go again. Good waiter service is hard to find. keep looking. Overall the dim sum is quite good. I am surprise to find such decent dim sum. I like the chicken feet, siu mai and bean curd wrap dumpling. They remodeled recently and ambient is good.However, taro cake was cold.congee was ok as it was quite flat in terms of taste Great dim sum! I love their sticky rice pork thing. Their egg custards are soo yummy!I also love their pea vines!! The lobster I had there was pretty good too. The flavors are amazing. I recommend it to those who love lobster, you can't go wrong with it. Brought in a friend's mother that was diabetic and told the wait staff that she was so that they could accomodate. They brought out steamed fish, ginger green onion lobster, and some garlic pea vines. It was amazing. Everything was so fresh and you can taste it because nothing was lathered with sauce like other chinese restaurants. The steamed tilapia had a light soy on it and went great with the steamed fish.The Lobster itself was sweet so they didnt have to do anything to it but accent it with green onions and ginger. The pea vines were extra fresh and crispy. Light garlic and pinch of salt made the freshness stand out. The parents loved it and i got an extra star in their book =0) Thanks Hong Kong restaurant! My husband and I come here with family for dim sum on weekends and for dinner on weekdays when we don't want to cook. &#160;The food and service are consistently good and we recommend this place to everyone! Check it out!! I have come to realize that I am truly turning into a food snob. &#160;I just expect quality for a fair price. &#160;Here you will get quality dim sum, friendly service, fast and the food is all of great quality. &#160;By that I mean some dim sum restaurants will not de-vein the shrimp and expect the customer to just eat the poo...Well not here. &#160;This dim sum is fresh and priced fair. &#160;I have ate dim sum at perhaps some 20 establishments and this is by far the best in every way. &#160;Give them a try, you won't be disappointed. &#160;Very crowded on the weekend but those carts come around frequently. &#160;Thanks! We've been eating here for the past 10+ years. Food is great- so happy they re-opened. &#160;Dimsum is delicious - &#160;my kids love their congee and my &#160;husband loves the chicken feet. &#160; Everything on their menu is good- my favorite is their Peking duck - but you'll have to order ahead of time.
For sure the the highlight was the ambiance. &#160;Decor is dim and comforting. While it might sound like a date location the noise level is crazy high. &#160;I struggled to hear people next to me and if you were an extra seat away you can forget about it.The food was meh for me too. &#160;Had the Cesar salad which came as whole leaves of lettuce. &#160;So I wound up cutting the lettuce with a knife. &#160;I get for a wedge salad that the cutting work is required, but for a Cesar? Had the Gnocchi which was also a strictly ho-hum affair. &#160;Desert was some caramel flan like thing which as the person seated next to me mentioned....seemed to have quite a bit of fiber. &#160;Somewhat gritty.This isn't the cheapest place on earth to eat either. &#160;And while I am absolutely fine with upscale prices they need to be backed up with some delicious food. So just Meh from me. I give very few places or even movies on Netflix a 5* rating. However, this place was really exceptionally great! &#160;The service from the host, bartender, to our waiter was exceptional. Not over the top friendly, just genuine and sincere. Much of that is probably tied to the vibe of the people in Seattle. Still. The history of Pike Place Market, the sunken feeling of being slightly below ground and the elegance of the restaurant was fantastic. So I guess I should speak of the food. Crap... As I'm writing this I can't friggen remember. But I know it was good. This was our a first year anniversary dinner of being together so we spent $$$ there. And I think a venue like this is perfect for it. If for nothing else, stop in for appetizers and ask about some history from the bartender. They are more than proud and happy to share. O la la! This would appear to make for a lovely date night.I end up at the bar and swore I met Ice Cube's twin. Of course, the dude's heard that before... what?! He's a cool bartender with a subtle, composed demeanor who offered some darn nice suggestions off the HH menu. Them goat cheese crostinis were good. Also had the sausage crostinis, soft calamari (some acquiring for me) and a whiskey sour. My friend and I were walking around downtown when we realized we were hungry and it suddenly occurred to us that it must be HH at that very moment SOMEWHERE in the city. &#160;After looking at a few places on Yelp, we chose Il Bistro. &#160;It took us a while to find it because Google Maps will tell you that you're there once you've reached Pike's Place Market...but I'm glad we persevered until we found the right spot; and we made it just as HH was starting!Everything sounded really good, so we shared a bunch of food: the goat cheese crostini, the bruschetta crostini, the Rigatoni Bolognese, the Cozze e Vongole, and the Sausage and Peppers pizza. &#160;We ordered the bolognese before our pizza came out, but had we waited, we probably wouldn't have ordered it (it was just okay in flavor AND the pizza ended up being plenty of food for the both of us!). The crostinis, pizza, and clams/mussels were all delicious though! &#160;Simply done and delightful. &#160;With $3 Pinot Grigio to wash it all down?? Yes, please!It was a cute spot - small and intimate (away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist attraction that is Pike's Place Market) - with flowers on each table, dim lighting, etc. &#160;After reading other Yelper's reviews, it looks like I'm going to have to come back for their regular menu. &#160;Thanks Yelp! You were successful once again! &#160;I probably would have never come here had it not been for you. :-) Sat outside while eating dinner here this past week -- great meal. &#160;My husband's pear and Gorgonzola ravioli with spinach, cherry tomatoes and a brown butter sauce was well-balanced light (if you can believe it with butter and cheese) ...My lasagna was a monster -- enough for 3 meals, literally. &#160;Again well-balanced and somewhat light (not as light as the lasagna at Cafe Lago or the Pink Door), but great flavor and texture.The bread for the bruschetta al pomodoro could have been toasted more for my liking, but the tomatoes were fresh and sweet and there was a sufficient amount of garlic and basil.I like the atmosphere in the bar and at a couple of table inside near the windows. &#160;For me, the other tables are just too dark, and some of them have an almost cave-like feel. &#160; Really enjoyed sitting outside watching a wedding party take photos, tourists come and go from visiting the disgusting "gum wall," and hearing the introduction to the Market Ghost Tour. I went here for a dinner date, and it was the perfect place for this! It is not an easy little restaurant to find, but it is a definite hidden gem tucked away in the infamous Pike Place Market!When entering the restaurant we were greeted and then sat immediately in a quiet, two-person table in the back corner of the restaurant. This was perfect because the atmosphere was just right for a dinner date! We were then greeted by our server and immediately given water to sip on! We didn't even have to ask for it! He presented us with the specials and then even offered to give us recommendations!For my appetizer, I had the fresh mixed greens salad with carrot curls and a goat cheese crostini. The salad was a classic well put together combination of simple yet flavorful combinations. For dinner, I ordered the pear and gorgonzola ravioli with a brown butter sauce. The ravioli had an unique taste that paired well with the sauce. I would highly recommend it! The server even mentioned that all the food was fresh from Pike Place, which was a definite plus too because we were eating nothing but the freshest ingredients!Our dinner was excellent and the service was spot on! I will definitely be coming back and recommending this restaurant to many of my friends! My boyfriend and I celebrated our 1st year together but unfortunately he forgot to make a reservation for us to a restaurant we both like, so we started yelping for I decent place to to for a very late dinner (it was 9:45pm) and we found Il Bistro!!!!We only made it for the late night menu but it was so good that the next time we went there we waited till 10pm so we can enjoy it again. We already took there a couple of our friends and they all loved it!Waiting for our next anniversary to try their dinner menu as well. We tried this place Saturday night - loved the bar area, the ambiance was great (except the couple in the corner who were lit and fondling each other). We had a few drinks while waiting for our friends to arrive - wasn't cheap, but it was expected.Once our friends arrived, we sat and ordered a couple of appetizers, the bruschetta and the carpaccio, both good. For dinner, &#160;I had the bolognese, which I was told was their most popular dish - I found it to be very lacking, it was almost all pasta, very little meat and very light on the sauce. One other person in our group had the bolognese and expressed the same sentiment - all others were happy with their meals, but nobody seemed to be overly impressed.I think that because it is located at the bottom of the street gives it a more romanticized aura about it, but if it were located in the Tukwila mall, I don't think it would do the same business. One of the aspects it is known for is being open late, which certainly is a plus - not many restaurants stay open til 2 am. If you are in the area, it's a great place to have a drink.All in all, I think it's a good place to try - we will give it another go, but I will definitely sample something else on the menu. I love this place. It's got the kind of urban nook and cranny setting that far too few places in Seattle have--you duck down a cobblestoned side alley, and there it is in the corner of the daylight basement. There's dining, and there's a bar. So far, I have always opted for the bar, but the food is supposed to be pretty good.The bar is a simple old-wood and marble setting, always with a well-versed and very engaging tender on duty. They have a great scotch list. It's a perfect recipe--sneak away down a side street, duck underground, find a utilitarian but charming and sophisticated bar, and start drinking some single malt. It never gets old. Came during our food tour, and got a taste of a well prepared risotto. I enjoyed the history lesson of the building and surronding too. Location: Down a old looking hill with bricks from SF, Lower street level of Pike Market. Already creating a nice atmosphere. It made me feel as if i traveled back in time. Atmosphere: Again, Time Traveled right when you walk in. The Bar was beautiful. Food: The risotto was all we had, but it was made technically well. Oyster and mussel to finish it. I wish we could have tried an entree before we left, but it is what it is. However, judging byt the one dish we had, i feel any dish would be done well there. Overall: I want to go back. Went here for a the first time last week after it was recommended by a friend.We also had the Passport Dining packet; which gives you discounts at many restaurants in the Seattle area. Il Bistro participates so we were able to buy one entree and get one free. They did have a happy hour going on, but we didn't do that as we had the passport dining.We went around 5 pm on a beautiful Wednesday and there was only two other couples in the dining area. Usually that's a bad sign, but our waiter told us it gets really busy after the market closes and the sun starts to go down. The pros of this place?- Romantic setting; I went with my boyfriend so it was perfect.- The attention by the staff is so great. It might be because there was hardly anyone there, but regardless, they were always there if we had a question and were very friendly. Our waiter even asked our names when we said we were going to come back and said he would definitely remember us. Rare to get that kind of service these days.- Great flavors. We had the mahi mahi special and the tortellini which were both very good. We also had the cheesecake dessert (which is definitely big enough to split, so glad we did that!). - Good location. It is a little hard to find as it is tucked away in the alley next to Pike Place, but it is in a great location to lots of great shops and places to go, so that's nice.The cons of this place?- Pricey, but we had the passport dining so it wasn't too bad. Although - you do get what you pay for, and the portions were just right and very good, so I would recommend it.I'd also recommend making a reservation if it's later in the day (past 6), as our waiter told us we came at the perfect time because they were going to be full later that night (on a Wednesday).Overall, good place and great food!-----Update: Went here again last night for my birthday.. better than the first time! Their flavoring on the sauces is SO good, and the attention and help from the staff is always excellent. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants! Headed to Seattle for business. &#160;Need to find a place for dinner for the Trustees. &#160;Saw the reviews and booked this place for 18 guests.The host was there the whole time and came by and made sure we were ok. &#160;The waiters came by to make sure our wine glasses/ drinks were not empty.I was the youngest person there that night, ranging from late 30's to 70's. &#160;I thought taking my kids out on the town was bad, these guys acted like 10 yr old. &#160;I was surprise the host did not come by to tell us to stop being so loud. &#160;We had a long table so they yelled across the table to each other. &#160; They were throwing things around. &#160;I was pretty embarrassed but the host didn't seem to mind. &#160;Maybe because they kept ordering drinks and because it was a weeknight.Over all the rating comes down to this....**** Service*** drinks (only because my cocktails tasted like non alcoholic drinks not enough to give me a buzz at all)**** was wonderful and it came out all about the same time for 18 guests!*****dessert was awesome. &#160;ate it all and didnt share!Would def come back here again the next time we are in Seattle. Pretty great place!I had a hard time finding it at first - it is located down a conspicuous set of stairs. &#160;If you don't know where you are going I'm not sure you will be able to find it! &#160;We had to ask a few people around the market place to guide us :).The bar is unfortunately closed right now, but we went for dinner anyways. &#160;We started off with some bruchetta and a caesar salad - both very yummy.For my entree I had the gnocchi. &#160;It was very good, very well cooked, but it wasn't the best of the best. &#160;Still good, but just didn't give me that WOW!I was underwhelmed by the free bread they gave at the table lol. &#160;Yes of course it is free so I should be grateful for anything, but it was just a plain french baguette with butter. &#160;It would have been really nice with olive oil, vinegar, garlic, etc, but it was just very plain, and not warm either!Anyways, my fiance had the penne with sausage baked - he loved it.Overall - really great food! &#160;Service was excellent as well - everyone was very friendly. I've come here for celebrations a couple years in a row now and have not been disappointed. They have a classy, romantically lit bar area off to the right and have no problems making a tasty mixed drink. The service is of the highest quality, with a well-informed, eloquent, and very polite wait staff. As for the food, it's hard to go wrong and everything I've had was top notch. A few must-try suggestions include the lasagna, penne al forno, and definitely the caretto d'agnello (lamb). Good for: fancy dinner and drinks with friends or a night on the town with your significant other. Amazing place. &#160;I have been in numerous times for happy hour and dinner; Mary, our server, dropped some huge knowledge on our champagne. &#160;Going back often! The food and wine are amazing! The service is outstanding. Sit back, relax, and let the food impress you. This is my fourth review of this place, but since I go so often I feel like I need to give them credit where it is due.As usual, we were there for happy hour last night. &#160;We haven't been in a couple months and we had a new server in the bar area. &#160;He was excellent and, as usual, the food and drink were great for the price. Best Italian I have had. &#160;Wonderful atmosphere, treated like royalty. &#160;Highly recommend. &#160;The main dining area was a bit loud however we found a very quiet table in the lounge and were served there. &#160;Definitely will return soon to this establishment. &#160;Thank you all for a wonderful evening. Wonderfully charming place located in the Pike Pl Market. Great service, tons of atmosphere and warmth &#160;- perfect location for celebrating three 40th birthdays with gal pals and our significant others. Every item we enjoyed was a standout:* Wines (great list with many solid, affordable choices)* Cocktails (made with fresh juices, good liquor, and potent!)* Appetizers (Gamberoni - good, garlicky, in a light broth we sopped up with bread. DELISH! Bruschetta - WOW!)* Salads (Caesar was especially good. I asked to share it with my friend and they split it in the kitchen and brought on two plates. Super nice and very accommodating of them.)* Entrees (Our group enjoyed Rigatoni Bolognese, Grilled Halibut, Sausage Risotto, Crispy Grilled Chicken and Seafood Fettuccine - all were FABULOUS! We were eating off of each other's plates and everything was just wonderful, fresh with great flavor.)* Dessert (We brought our own candles and they lit them and brought them out on a slice of tiramisu, which us girls shared).Solid, 4-star dining experience. It would have been 5, bu they lose a star because the bill came and we noticed they charged us for the dessert. Really?! &#160;We dropped a good amount of coin here and a comp slice of tiramisu wouldn't have been too much for them to throw in, but whatever. Great place to celebrate a special occasion, anniversary or just pop in for tapas and drinks at the bar. Great setting. And very intimate. Food was good (although I only had two dishes), but the service and attention was tremendous. Solid choice if you're in Seattle craving some Italian. My aunt came to visit from Michigan in April. We wanted to take her somewhere nice after a day of wine tasting in Woodinville. I had heard a few people mention Il Bistro in passing and decided to give it a shot. We weren't disappointed! Firstly I would like to say, that if you don't know where you're going, it is a little tricky to find. My aunt is a pretty picky eater. I was a little nervous taking her somewhere "fancy" that might not have your cut &amp; dry "cookie cutter" menu options. She loved it! We started with the mussels appetizer for the table. She had never tried mussels before &amp; though she thought they were tasty she wasn't a fan. No big deal, more for me &amp; my boyfriend! They were absolutely delicious &amp; we all took part in soaking up the yummy broth with our complimentary bread. The Caesar salad was wonderful &amp; enough for the 3 of us to split.I ordered the Orecchiette con Piselli. It is orecchiette pasta in a creamy sauce with peas &amp; proscuitto. Delicious! The sauce was like butter, the proscuitto was perfectly salty, &amp; the peas were nice and firm. I hate when you order peas in a pasta dish &amp; they are mushy, yuck!My boyfriend had the lasagna &amp; it was HUGE! It was a mix of ground veal &amp; lamb. I only had a bite, and though it was quite good, I can't say too much about it. All I know is that he cleared his plate &amp; it was a large serving!My aunt had some sort of squash ravioli. I checked the menu &amp; didn't see it on there anymore so I can't quite say what was in it. I know it came with chicken &amp; when she mentioned she wasn't that big of a meat eater the waiter made sure to let her know she could order any of the pasta dishes sans meat. No problem. For as picky as she was she cleared her plate! I mean, sauce and all was gone. It looked like she had licked the plate clean! Haha. I would say all and all our visit to Il Bistro was a success. If I had to pick something I didn't like it would be that the tables seemed too close together. I felt like I was sitting on top of the table next to ours. The wines by the bottle menu also wasn't that great. Maybe I just felt that way because we'd been spoiled in the sun all day in Woodinville. Who knows? The restaurant seemed very clean but there was no paper towel in the ladies restroom. Not so great when you're wearing a dress &amp; can't wipe your hands on your pants or something. Would I recommend this place? Definitely. We just returned from our 4th anniversary dinner here. From our arrival through the first couple bites of our food, this place sat at a comfortable 4-stars. The speed with which the rating plummeted gave me a case of whiplash that I suspect will only be cured by this review.The good: the food was great, really. We had the bruschetta, the orrecchiette and the lasagna. It was all very good. The environment was great for our dinner date, despite receiving one of their middle-of-the-room tables. The service started out acceptably but turned bad quickly.The bad: in hindsight, some elements of the service left a bit to be desired before we even arrived: my husband called to try to set a reservation for just 30 minutes in the future and to let them know it was a special evening. The gentleman who answered the phone simply said, "you should be good, Man. Just come on in" leaving us without an opportunity to make it clear that we were hoping for a special evening. Admittedly, this would not be an offense without the rest of the experience. After our dinner arrived, we were completely ignored. I sat with an empty wine glass for 20+ minutes and an untouched plate for the same amount of time. I initially thought he may be the only server so I was giving him a break, but he had plenty of help and when I saw him chumming around with people at the host stand, I about burst a vein in my eyeball. All of the people lounging around the entrance to the kitchen while I blatantly stared at them did not help. We actually had to forego dessert and the glass of wine as our sleepy toddler was awaiting our arrival back home. It took a good 15+ minutes more to finally settle our bill. In this time, one of the servers attempted to bring us new bread thinking we were a new table. Which, I can't really blame him; I'd find it hard to believe we were the same people that had been there the entire time.I'm in such a sour mood now. And I'm not one to complain. Look at my (minimal) Yelp history! I'm easy to please.So, yeah, approach with a completely open schedule and a lowered service expectation and maybe you'll really get to appreciate the 4-star quality of the food. The wife and I had dinner here before heading over to Benaroya Hall for a show. We had an early Saturday evening reservation (600p), one of only two available two days in advance. It was still pretty empty when we arrived but didn't take long to fill up. It's in a great location, I'd been to Pike Place several times and never knew it was right there.We were there a few months ago and I can't remember exactly what we had but I do remember that everything was fantastic. Great service, nice pace, no rush but no extra waiting... that kind of thing.Somewhat pricey, but you know that going into it. I had a cocktail, we shared a 1/2 bottle of wine, shared an appetizer, two entrees, and shared dessert. I think it was around $150 total.I really should write reviews in a more timely manner so I can remember the details, but we're going back next week and it reminded me that I owed Il Bistro 5 stars. Romantic, delicious, and excellent service. The chicken breast was lovely, the rabbit tender and tasty, and the tiramisu is fluffy and light. Yum. Delicious food and excellent service. Lovely restaurant tucked away in the Market. Wonderful food all around and great knowledgable service-listen to their recommendations. &#160;I had one of the most delcious meals I have had in a long time here-the chef's special halibut and an amazing chocolate flourless cake for dessert. First class food, lovely setting, charming and romantic. Wonderful waiter. Highly recommend. Only negative is that it could be a bit brighter... I must confess that I have been going to Il Bistro for 25 years or more. &#160;It is tucked down Post Alley on the side of Pike Place Market, a gem set in the lower level of that tourist fav. &#160;Wood paneled floors, large support beams, round tables, and a low ceiling-ed intimate atmosphere make this restaurant a perfect choice for a date or group dinner. I've done both. &#160;Now, certainly there might be a night when everything doesn't go perfectly, as one reviewer found recently, but for consistently good service, food, and beverages, you won't find Il Bistro's equal soon. &#160;The risotto is extraordinary, but I return time and again to the Ragu with Penne. &#160;Yummmmmmmmy and enough to save for lunch the next day. &#160;Do yourself a favor and reserve a place at Il Bistro. &#160;It makes a delightful visit to Seattle one better. My husband took me here for our anniversary and I am so glad he did. &#160;Our table was tucked away in a corner with rose petals scattered and champagne ready to drink (pay the extra $, its worth it!). &#160;The atmosphere was perfect for a romantic night out!The chef's specials were so delicious, we could have eaten plates and plates of his roasted chicken risotto! &#160;And make sure to try the Filleto de Manzo! &#160;The steak melts in your mouth. &#160;Perfectly cooked!For our first time going here we were blown away by the excellent service, delicious food and romantic atmosphere. &#160;Once you try this place, you'll be back to visit in no time! &#160;See you soon Il Bistro! I had a couple of birthday dinners here including my own one in the 2011. Great service and food was above average. Not the super big fans of this rest (but I am pretty critical to pick out my favorite place to eat) but this is a restaurant that I would like to go back once in awhile too. Wonderful atmosphere, friendly staff, a true find, slightly removed from the hustle and bustle of the tourist drama associated with the market. I would highly reccomend the prawns for a starter. The portions were generous, wine list and staff suggestions were spot on. We had the pleasure of dining here during a recent visit to Seattle. The ambiance and location are fantastic. It's off the beaten path, yet close to Pikes Market, and very romantic. (They were very helpful, so don't hesitate to call if you have questions about directions, dress, etc.) We were able to make reservations within the hour, and practically had the restaurant to ourselves on the Wednesday night we visited (though I can imagine this place gets busy at times, so it seems reservations are still a good idea). The service was wonderful; attentive and informative, but respectful and conducive to a nice, relaxed dinner. I had a lovely glass of Prosecco with my pear and gargonzola ravioli (unique and quite the sensory experience!), and my fiance had a delicious salmon filet over risotto, complimented well by the suggested Chianti. The lemon marscapone cheesecake was an excellent finish to an excellent meal. We had dinner at Il Bistro to celebrate our sons graduation from UW. Overall we liked it. The place has great ambiance and and we were greeted by a friendly host who took our coats which is nice. Our waiter was friendly but not overbearing and when we explained we were on a timeline he made sure our food was served in a timely manner but we never felt rushed. He also made an excellent suggestion for wine.The food was good, but I thought for the price it could have been better.My dish, Snapper on a bed of fettucine with olives and capers, was a bit salty, but the fish was cooked just right. Our daughter had the Seafood and fettucine dish and it was good but a little bland and our son had the Gnocchi and it was the same good but could have been more flavorful. The desserts were fantastic. We had the Panna Cotta and the Cheesecake and they &#160;had a dairy free Sorbet so our daughter got to enjoy dessert with us.I hope this is helpful. Checked this place out on a dinner date and was pleasantly surprised. It was recommended to me from the Concierge from Hotel 1000 and they even dropped us off. I had a car service pick us up after and take us on a ride around Seattle. The food and service are impeccable and I will return on my next visit to Seattle. My husband and I have been to Il Bistro twice in the last week. &#160;We stumbled upon it the first time ... it's tucked down a little staircase near the Pike Place Market brass pig. &#160;We sat up at the bar and had cocktails before moving on the wine list. &#160;Which is pretty extensive, but the sommelier came over and was very helpful in guiding us through the unfamiliar Italian wines. &#160;We ordered appetizers to go with the wine ... the antipasta plate and the calamari the first time and the carpaccio the second time. &#160;Both times we also wanted food that wasn't on the menu and the staff were very obliging. &#160;On our first visit they put together a cheese plate for us and the second time I was craving fruit and so they put together a lovely fruit plate to nibble on.The bar staff are attentive but not intrusive and the atmosphere is intimate but not stifling. We'll definitely go back when we visit Seattle and I'm looking forward to actually sitting at a table and eating a proper dinner.
I have been to the Thaiger Room before and always been happy with the food. As a part of my never-ending quest for the best green curry I recently tried their take on the dish. &#160;Very impressed! &#160;It wasn't too heavy on the coconut milk but still had a nice, creamy texture. &#160;I don't remember tasting any basil which is a serious no-no but the eggplant pretty much made up for it.As for the other food we ordered, it was very tasty but they gave us beef instead of chicken in one dish and supposedly wouldn't deliver to my friend's house where they have before. &#160;If I had to choose I would just eat in the restaurant and skip the delivery. I used to go here a lot 3-4 years ago and really liked their food. &#160;I don't remember their food being so grossly sweet back then. &#160;The spice level was all over the place although we all had 4 stars. &#160;Service was really slow and the place wasn't even full. &#160;I probably won't go back. This used to be my favorite Thai place. Sure, the food was inconsistent: sometimes the peanut sauce was too sweet, sometimes the 4 star wasn't even spicy, but nothing too horrible. Last night changed my mind. I ordered 2 of my favorite dishes: Shrimp Pad Thai and Drunken Noodles. It was the worst Thai food I've ever had. Worst than Thai food at a mall in the Midwest. The Pad Thai was dry- the shrimp was way overcooked and the noodles were flavorless. The drunken noodle was worse. It was weirdly sticky, appeared to lack sauce, and was frankly, inedible. I ended up throwing them out, because I didn't feel like driving the 12 miles round trip back to the U-District to complain. I guess I am going to have to find a new Thai place. My first experience with the Thaiger Room was a good one. I had delivery with my roommate. We were happy they delivered to our place as it probably pushes the boundaries of their delivery area. Regardless it was pretty fast. Their pad thai and pad see yew (I think that was it) were really good and the peanut sauce that I ordered extra was awesome. There food was better than a lot of thai places I've tried. I was a little confused as to how our order that should have been about $16 came up to $20 but I have to fault myself for not caring enough to ask about it. For take out/delivery, I think I found my place. Great yellow curry chicken, fast service, generous portions. So far, the best Thai curry I keep wanting to go back to since moving here in May. My bf digs their Thai iced tea and phad see ew (?)First time I went, I got medium spicy and it was just right. Next few times, it was a bit weak on the spicy. Now I get hot and it's perfect. Great food! Here was my early rating of Thaiger Room:Food quality: 4.5/5.0Portion Size: 5.0/5.0Menu Selection: 4.0/5.0Price: 5.0/5.0Service: 4.0/5.0Atmosphere: 3.0/5.0Cleanliness: 1.0/5.0 (Cockroaches in the food!!!)I use to frequent the Thaiger Room often and found their green and yellow curries delicious, service was fairly quick as well. Fast forward to a couple years after first discovering the Thaiger Room, I went in and found my glass of water cloudy with debris floating around in it and with an off taste. &#160;I asked for a replacement glass and got another cloudy glass of water that was poured from a pitcher that had the same problem. &#160;Strike one. &#160;A few months later I decided to try the Thaiger Room again. &#160;This time I found what appeared to be cockroach legs in my Thai style noodles, but I wasn't sure. &#160;The "appendage like" matter was cooked along with my noodles and may have been burnt pieces of vegetable fiber (at least that's what I hoped it was.) &#160;I didn't care for what I saw and got kind of freaked out. Strike two.One night I was walking with my family down the Ave. looking for a place to eat. &#160;I wanted to go to Thai 65 but my wife had walked ahead of me and wanted to eat at the Thaiger Room. &#160;I didn't want to upset her by suggesting we eat at another restaurant (other than the one she choose) so we all sat down and ordered our meals at the Thaiger Room.When the food arrived I immediately noticed a 1-inch long cockroach running along the side on my youngest son's plate of green seafood curry. &#160;My son brushed the live cockroach off his dish! &#160;We were all kind of stunned. &#160;The waitress saw what had happened and asked us if anything was wrong. &#160;I told her we saw a cockroach running along the dish that was just served. &#160;She asked if we wanted a replacement and made no apologizes for what had happened.Strike three, that's the last time I've been to Thaiger Thai and will never go back.Thaiger room still serves a good tasting food at a reasonable price but I had to deduct 4 stars for the lack of cleanliness in addition to the "cockroach factor." &#160;I think it's time to call the health department on this place! &#160;These people know they have &#160;roach problems and don't seem motivated to improve things. My quest for decent Thai food in Seattle continues. I'm not asking for Thailand quality Thai food but at least something that resembles authentic Thai food would be nice. All the Thai restuarants I've had in Seattle, calling themselves authentic Thai food is like Panda Express calling them authentic Chinese food or Taco Bell saying they've got authentic Mexican food. I ordered their Garlic Fried rice figuring you can't screw up on Fried rice, right? WRONG. I had soggy fried rice. Didn't anyone tell the chef that you can't make fried rice from soggy hot rice? My GF had the phad thai which tasted like sugar noodles. I would give this place 1/2 star for their food and 1/2 star for their service. I brought my leftovers back for my dog and even she didn't like it, and she licks her own butt!! Correction: I go here only when Appethai is closed, and only because Thai 65 is even worse.If you choose to keep a restaurant open on New Year's Day, expect it to be hectic. That's no excuse for the terrible service. First, we're seated at a table so wobbly our drinks would have fallen off. Then, we're not told that several dishes are unavailable until we order them. Better yet, our check arrives less than five minutes after our entrees -- sure makes the customer feel welcome and not hurried at all. After we're finally done eating, the waitress ignores our table before finally taking our payment and bringing a box -- only for me. I seldom advocate leaving a bad tip, but that instance as worth it (and in that instance, I include the indigestion that lingered all night). 5 Stars worth of ANGER!! &#160;I just returned to Thaiger Room to give it another chance,,,regret it from first sight and first bite. &#160;Do not let the new late hours tempt you-cash only will give you a hint of the lack of service you'll receive, but the same arrogant dude standing by the register/next to Snapple cooler counting the cash. &#160;Still remains is the sole cook ,slaving away. &#160;Fast forward to my to go order...thaiger noodles with beef. &#160;Every slice of beef was TOUGH and CHEWY(2 min. to chew, and still i hesitated to swallow for fear of choking) &#160;The spice level of 3 was the only thing that came out right. &#160;The to-go box collapsed within itself b/c the slop was sooo mushy. I am going to send $7.00 back to the restaurant; pay them for not cooking for me ever again! &#160;Mr. Spikey Hair, I'll open the door for you b/c I have to take a smoke break, &#160;I will have another $7.00 in the envelope in hopes that you will give it to the young lady who had cooked feverishly as I awaited for my slop to-go. &#160;BTW, Little Thai is Excellent!
I give love to Liberty for their intimate cozy atmosphere, great cocktails and wine list, and of course the delicious sushi! &#160;My only negative is it adds up cost-wise, and I wish there were other food options on the menu to accompany the sushi tastings. &#160;Edemame and then a tasty dessert option would have made this a 4 or 5 star review for me! Really pleased that the owner Andrew contacted me personally about my review. It shows a lot of professionalism and makes up quite a bit for my experience.Thanks Andrew. I dident know they have sushi here, I've only been here in the morning for coffee.The place is dimly lit, like a bar in the daytime, which it is. Pretty depressing with seattles weather. Nice comfy couches, nice barista, never crowded(the cafe types much prefer some of the other cafes down the street.)The coffee is great. They get Sumptown coffee, which I'm a fan of. &#160;Its not the bitter stuff your parents grew up on.All in all this place is great, but the atmosphere is wrong for a cafe. As a bar it looks like it would be cramped but I've never been. If you want to go to a great coffe and bar, Faire cafe gallery is The Best. Liberty is good if your nearby and want some social coffee.To repeat, this review is for the morning service. This neighborhood bar on 15th exemplifies what a neighborhood bar should be: comfortable, friendly, good solid drinks, tasty food, good atmosphere, and reliable. Great happy hour and great prices.Also, it's not a club scene and thank god. It has a great mix of people though and that really says more. You can have a conversation and hear the other person, even though it's plenty lively and there's music going. Everything works.PS - If you want authentic Japanese traditional sushi, go to Maneki. This is spot-on american sushi and I'm good with that, and they're not trying to sell it as anything else. Plus it's always good and fresh, and it's better than I've had at some Japanese restaurants even. Love the comfy couches and the decor. Cool art work on the walls. The back "red" room seemed cool but there was another party going on back there. It gets pretty hot on summer nights so be prepared to hang out by the door. Yummy sushi and good drinks! I like this place a lot. Cool atmosphere, creative drinks, and tasty sushi-- why aren't more bars like this?It can get crowded, so if you're in a large group, you need to come early or just assume you're not getting a seat. However, there are some really comfy couches for sitting around, drinking and munching. For the vegetarian crowd, the veggie rolls are really tasty, and far more complex than your typical cucumber roll. The menu is comprehensive, and contains a lot of new things to try. Worth the slightly higher prices for sure. There are sushi bars, and there are bars with sushi. &#160;Liberty falls under the second category, and I thought it would be sketchy, but this turned out to be a great place.The atmosphere is dark and cozy-- loud enough music to feel like you're at a bar but not so loud you can't carry on a conversation. They had a good selection of both beer and mixed drinks, including several absinthe options if you're into that &#160;I was driving so I skipped out this time, but my friends all tried it, more for the experience than the taste. The sushi menu is extensive; I had a spicy tuna roll and it was excellent. &#160;A friend tried out several different rolls, and liked all of them.Not cheap, but good drinks and sushi usually aren't. &#160;Five stars to Liberty. The sushi is quite nice, and some of the items are innovative, particularly on the veggie side. Major props there.Where it fell down for us was, sadly, the cocktails. The menu as viewed online was really promising, but the drinks themselves just did not deliver the depth/complexity of flavors we were hoping for. My rhubarb-lemon-gin mix was... pink lemon juice with weakly-flavored gin, as far as I could tell. My companion had a bit of better luck, although again, when she ordered a "sparkling" cocktail, we had trouble tasting anything other than the wine in it.I'm thinking the key here is to sit at the bar and talk to the bartender directly, which seems to be the way others have enjoyed it. In the meantime, much as the sushi is good, I'm going back down the hill to the Living Room, which does the same thing at the same price point and whose stock drinks have tickled my tastebuds a lot better. Best negroni ever. If you sit at the bar on a slow night, they will play around with cocktail recipes for you. Despite all the other good qualities of this bar, the willing playfulness of the bar staff (and their desire to educate you about random Italian grappa based liqueurs) is the BEST reason to go and drop a shite ton of money here. Lord knows we are prone to this, and its totally worth it. Liberty, I have something to confess. I have kind of a crush on you. As a committed fish hater (sorry), you changed my mind on sushi. The vegetarian rainbow grocery roll or maybe it's the vegetarian jamjuree... &#160;either way, they are both DELICIOUS. The drinks you serve me are always strong and wonderful, your atmosphere is perfect, and you always seem to find a spot for me, even when it's a weekend night and you're very busy. I absolutely hate having anything negative to report, but I have to mention the unenthusiastic response to the "yelp pal" discount. I think I'm a pretty good pal. I like yelp. Most importantly, I like like you, Liberty. The same server I've had hasn't always been the friendliest (maybe an off day or three) but having just read about the yelp discount, I was more curious and intrigued than anything. She ignored my awkward "Uhh.... So... I'm a yelp pal...?" leaving me feeling like a dejected kid on the playground. I won't hold it against you. I'll definitely still be back. Just a little more shy, I guess. Maybe because my expectations were low, but I liked this place. &#160;They seem to only serve liquor and sushi. &#160;We had some salmon that was torch grilled and it was pretty yummy. &#160;We were with a group of people and really enjoyed the backroom that they have and their attentiveness to our needs, constantly coming back to make sure that we had enough water, or sushi, or drinks. &#160;Their hours are great too, open till 2 AM. &#160;Parking is difficult in this neighborhood. Not bad at all! This place has really cool artwork and comfy to lounge around. I had their chef plate for $10 and it was delicious. From what I was told, it's never the same so that day I had shrimp nigiri, 2 kinds of rolls (i think one had tuna in it while the other had smoked salmon?) and a bit of sashimi. &#160;I'm glad I got that because I never really tried the shrimp nigiri and it was not as bad as I imagined it to be. &#160;What I highly recommend is their albacore tuna sashimi. It was melt-in-your-mouth goodness! A real drinkers type of bar! &#160;Wait, that might have sounded bad.... &#160;What I mean I'd they take cocktails and liquor very seriously here! &#160;Delicious drinks, good beer selection, and decent sushi to boot! &#160;I also love the local art covering the walls. Living all the way north in Anacortes, I have to really choose carefully when I have a chance to enjoy some great city places to drink and eat(in that order). I rarely miss a chance to make it in to Liberty if I'm in Seattle. It is one of the top places to enjoy a fantastic drink made by real bartenders who care. The drink menu is outstanding if you really have an interest in bars with an understanding of craft, originality and history. The liquor selection is unbelievable (Japanese whiskys, amaros, Rye, Bourbons, Gins, exotic liquors and bitters etc..). The bartenders all love to talk about what they have and dig mixing it up for you. I really love sushi and worked at a sushi bar for 6 years. I'm spoiled a bit. So, while the sushi at Liberty is not "traditional" or a sushi "experience" it is really enjoyable and fitting for the place.The seating is comfy and casual. The decor is loose and the walls are littered with band posters from gigs that I wish I had been to(ok I was at a few of 'em).Look, don't be in a rush and don't have the usual and Liberty will blow your mind. I know liberty loves me! In fact it is one of the few reasons I go to Capitol Hill. An excellent drink menu and knowledgeable bartenders crafting cocktails makes this place a hit. The back room makes it a lot easier to get a seat, and the occasional dog friendly neighborhood BBQ also makes this a place I enjoy visiting. Liberty takes many of the best parts of a pretentious cocktail bar and blends it with the joys of your local pub, the result is blend that works well. It's enough to make you want to live in the neighborhood. A shout out to fellow sudamericanos -- they have pisco!The Good-- many, many drink options including international liqueurs that can be a bit tricky to find. &#160;The waitstaff/bartenders are not only friendly but very helpful in your efforts to find the best deal on the menu. &#160;The restaurant has a lovely atmosphere- music isn't too loud and the lightning's perfect and dim-- a bit romantic, really.The Bad-- Happy hour sushi only included one item, which wasn't vegan. &#160;It can get really crowded, so make sure to get there early!Also-- The drinks here are a bit stronger than elsewhere-- ended up a bit drunk after only two gin and tonics. Andrew Friedman, the owner of Liberty, has since contacted me to try to resolve the issue we had with our waitress, and has been open to listening to our side of the story and getting to the bottom of it all. Plus-one star for Liberty! Ok ok...the bartenders kind of kick ass AND I left my hat there and they actually PUT IT ASIDE for me to pick up the next day instead of being dickwads and a) taking it home or b) giving it away.Thank you Liberty, thank you. &#160;You will be receiving more business from me. Kick-ass sushi, killer drinks, and excellent service to boot.We accumulated a group of about 15 people here on a bitter cold Saturday night and had a blast. Our server was awesome and somehow remembered everyone's faces AND drink orders. She was able to close out my drinks, even though everything was on one tab, which I really appreciated.The smoked salmon sushi was pretty fantastic and the seaweed salad was fresh and light.My only beef (er, sushi?) with the place is the seating can be a little dicey--most of the booth seats kind of tip forward, which is good for keeping you sober enough from slinking down to the floor, not great for comfortably sitting back with your cocktail. This place annoys me. It looks like a hair salon, complete with floor to ceiling mirrors and a waiting area in front with couches. Oh god, and the artwork is, to borrow a phrase from an old friend, a parody of itself.They were out of all 4 vintages of the rum I wanted, but the waitress didn't say anything. Instead I had an awkward interchange with one of the bar staff, and ultimately didn't get the chance to order anything else.At least they use quality booze in their house cocktails. And the recipes looked very innovative. So plus one star for that. My friend told us she was going to take us to get Sushi, so when I walked into Liberty, I was quite apprehensive. &#160;I would not call it a sushi bar, but rather a bar that serves sushi. &#160;That being said, I was very pleased with my meal. &#160;The service was very friendly. &#160;We were brought the wrong drinks, then given the correct ones without having the first ones removed. &#160;The sushi was remarkable. &#160;We ordered the $30 chef's choice and an order of Maguro Poki. &#160;I walked out well fed and happy. &#160;Thanks Liberty! Yay! I'm a fan, indeed. I went here last night for the first time for a friend's birthday party. I've passed by it a few times on my way to various brunch spots and thought it looked cozy, with the conversational style seating arrangements near front. When we got there we had a bit of trouble finding where the party was at, but patrons pointed us in the right direction when they saw our puzzled glances at one and other, saying, "Are you here for *#*#(@'s party? It's in the back room right there." The back room is great for just this type of event. Enough room for lounging on the big, comfy, black leather couches, or dancing. I also asked the bartender about the 'infused liquors' that were on the menu and displayed on the bar, had a conversation about them with him and asked for a drink, to which he asked a few qualifying questions to find out what type I'd like and proceeded to concoct the best drink I think I've ever had. Crisp, citrusy, slightly sweet, in a wooden tiki mug, topped with a lime and sugar cube set on fire! This man gets an A+ and so does this bar. I know it already has a great reputation, but I am such a fan of great customer service, that I have to yelp about this! :DI didn't have any of the sushi that they serve all night long, but it looked delicious, and will have to try next time. Only downside was the state of the bathrooms towards the end of the night. :( The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars. No place is perfection, but I will definitely be coming back! There is no better bar in Seattle. I have just had the best sidecar of my life and my foodie friends and I have been exchanging drinks like stoned people with lighted snowglobes. The is a place of high art in mixology. To call the bartenders, bartenders would be a great understatement. They are artists. This is a place of the arts. Also the sushi is killer. I don't want to leave. &#160;If you want excellence in mixology and people that know the classics, this is the place! Art of the drink! Art of the drink! Drink of the art!! A whisky bar that also serves delicious sushi! &#160;How can you resist? &#160;Sexy lighting, interesting artwork and a nice selection of seating options from cozy couches to a leather banquette dotted with two-tops and of course the bar. &#160;This place has a great neighborhood feel, I always am instantly at ease the moment I walk in. I had sushi here for the first time this week and our group went through five rounds of sushi, that's how good it was. &#160;The Joe's hanoo roll is a must-order: a califonia roll topped with salmon and some fabulous aoili. &#160;I also recommend the alaska roll which was addictive, the salmon just melts in your mouth and makes you go weak at the knees. &#160;And don't forget the poki, chunks of raw tuna and cucumber dressed in sesame oil on top of a bed of seaweed that isn't simply for presentation. &#160;I'd eat a bowl of that seaweed by itself. You know what? &#160;I like booze. &#160;A lot. &#160;I like the way it tastes (mostly), and I like the way it gives you something to talk about the next day. &#160;So, as that pertains to Liberty: &#160;Go there. They know their shit. &#160;Andrew, the owner, will school the heck out of you on your spirit of choice. &#160; They have fine selection of signature drinks (I like the Dragon's Toe) and are incredibly accommodating. &#160;It's got an intimate, even-strangers-are-regulars vibe and the music selection is rad. &#160; &#160; &#160;Want a bonus? &#160;Good sushi. This place is high quality, down to earth and friendly all at the same time. &#160;It is one of the smartest bars on capitol hill, including the customers. &#160;I can't say much about the sushi because I don't eat sushi, I came here all the time anyways when I lived in Seattle down the street. &#160;Very impressive selection of liquor! &#160;Overall a great place to drink alcohol or coffee (they serve Stumptown!) Two rules to make your Liberty experience the tops:1 - Don't be in a great big rush. &#160;They're serving nice drinks you should be savoring anyhow, so this should be easy.2 - Always *always* sit at the bar if you can. &#160;Exception: If I'm there and there are no seats at the bar. &#160;Don't break my heart.Sitting at the bar and talking to the bartenders is a great experience, not only for the fact that they're exceptional at what they do; in my last visit, I had the chance to sample 2 different liqueurs that I had never tried (simply by my fiancee asking about them within earshot of the bartender) as well as a comparison between two Japanese Whiskys (which I can't imagine were cheap).I pretty much never go there after 6 PM (I get out of work early) and there's almost never a crowd at those hours. I wish I had known about this "Yelp Pal" deal yesterday, what on earth is this surprise incentive? Anyway, this place was lovely. Stopped in with a friend on a rainy Saturday afternoon to appease my common craving of sushi, and meanwhile took care of my even more common craving of delicious cocktails. The enjoyment of these two items simultaneously was almost too much to bear... The sushi was actually pretty good considering this is definitely more of a bar; the tuna sashimi was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, however the lack of miso soup was a definite minus. The bar was calm and cozy, with a coffee shop/lounge vibe... you walk into a living room basically, with the bar and a couple tables just beyond it. Very friendly bar service, and a breathtakingly wonderful (mellow classic rock: Rolling Stones, Nick Drake, Bert Jansch) music selection playing overhead. I will definitely go back. My friends and I wandered into Liberty at about 1 am on a random night during our one week stay in Seattle. We had been in U-District for some reason earlier in the night which was bleh, so we decided to venture over to Capitol Hill for some real bars. We weren't sure exactly where we were going, but driving down the street we saw Liberty and thought it looked inticing. Good choice on our part. The atmosphere was very relaxed and laid back, perfect place to hang out and talk. The music was pretty sweet too and our bartender, Aaron was awesome! We only got to stay for a little over an hour, so Aaron invited us back the next day for happy hour- and we went! This time 2 women were sitting next to us with their dogs! I've never seen dogs hanging out in a bar before... actually that's a complete lie - I saw a dog in a bar in Brooklyn once, but... shh... We ended up chillin with Aaron again and enjoyed some delicious cocktails and soon ventured down the street to 22 Doors. If I am ever in Seattle again (which I really really hope I will be) I will definitely be coming back to Liberty. I had my birthday party there on Saturday night in their BRAND NEW back room. &#160;I couldn't have asked for a better experience! Andrew and Keith were a pleasure to work with, I can't wait to tell ALL my friends about it! Late night sushi? Yup, they got it....and it's not half bad. &#160;A great spot on 15th, Liberty does a good job of drawing people away from Broadway and up the hill. &#160;With cool art, good crowd and great drinks it's a worthy stop on Capitol Hill's 'other' main street. &#160;I'd suggest trying to grab a seat at the bar, as service will be that much more quick. I'm sorry Liberty but i just wasn't that impressed.... you serve food late into the night, one star. your service was great, one star. sadly the sushi is awful. minus one star. the decor is bland and unoriginal. minus yet another star. and finally the drinks we ordered were b-a-d. Everyone in there seemed to be having a great time and I think the place has a lot of potential. Perhaps i came on and off night...but with all the other options in this city its unlikely that I'll give it another shot. I have only been to Liberty twice since it opened. Once right after it opened and once recently. It isn't a place I think of to go to. Some friends and I ended up there when our original location was too crowded. The atmosphere at Liberty was cozy with a big couch, the perfect size for our party. I ordered a sushi roll and a drink with tequila. The drink was delicious and just what was needed after the most brutal quarter in nursing school so far (hopefully of all time). The sushi was just OK. I didn't really have high expectations and it beat those expectations. I wouldn't make this your destination for sushi, but definitely don't avoid ordering it if you find yourself hungry at Liberty. I would go back to hang out with friends and have drinks. Be patient and all things wonderful and delicious will find you here. &#160;This is yet another bourbon-rich location with ambiance and drink-knowledge coming out of its ears. &#160;The menu is reasonably priced and the staff are welcoming beyond all measure. &#160;If you have to wait a bit, understand that it's because you'll be getting personal attention about your every drinking pleasure. &#160;The food is divine, and the company you'll keep in this secluded, locale-rich Seattle treasure will almost certainly keep you coming back Was never a fan of sushi until I came here. I know, sushi in a bar/lounge!?!! Its good though! The drinks are always good too though I rarely get anything other than their No. 44 Orange (GO SYRACUSE!). The art and decor use to change more frequently when I started coming here over 2 years ago, not so much anymore (I miss that). All in all still one of my favorite places in Seattle Awesome neighborhood joint. Where else can you chase your Vieux Carre with a PBR? Welcoming and warm staff with tasty sushi. Try the Johanno roll and Tataki. I love liberty for it's outstanding cocktails and distinctive liquor selection! It's welcoming and sophisticated at the same time. One of my favorite bars in town for along time. Sadly, I don't live around the corner any more. Went to Liberty for the first time today for a happy hour and loved it. &#160;Small quaint and homey. &#160;Great place to hang out after work Love this place. Good drinks, good food and nice staff, it was fun. A bar that serves sushi! And not scary sushi either.Great atmosphere, the artwork that adorns this place is worth the visit on it's own.Comfy couches up front make for a VERY casual atmosphere where you can enjoy drinks with friends.They also have an impressive absinthe selection, with an ornate iced water drip for the sugar-cube.A MUST VISIT if you're in the area. ^_^ Recently went on a date here. &#160;The atmosphere is great, the bartenders are friendly, and the sushi was actually very well prepared and presented. &#160;My Rosita (tequila drink) was a bit on the strong side, so I had to nurse it the whole evening as my only drink. &#160;They even offered us free tastes of drinks they are working on at the bar. &#160;That was a nice touch. &#160;It provided for a cozy, and rather successful date. ;) Liberty shines as an outpost of delicious liquor drinks on the north end of capitol hill. &#160;Consistently awesome service, talented bartenders, and an awesome neighborhood vibe.Speaking of great bartending, I recommend you meet Aaron. &#160;Avoid the group tables, get everyone to the bar (crowd 5+ people around a couple bar stools if you have to), and let the man mix impressive drinks. &#160;Rum, vodka, gin, bitters -- he does wonderful things with it all. &#160;Extra drink tastes from groups getting table service are likely to land with the more inquisitive in your group, quite the bonus. These people had old CIV and Quicksand flyers up. They had me at hello. the beer was tasty and Beth liked her mixed drinks. The waitress was friendly, too.That's all there is to it. Bar-slash-coffee shop? Mama like!I rolled in here one morning to do some school work. There was a hipster-looking guy behind the counter, and a few construction workers sipping their morning pick-me-ups. Hipster served me up some seriously strong "drip coffee" which I'm pretty sure was french press--yummy! And recommended his favorite pastry, some kind of croissant-roll thingie. Also yummy.So I logged onto their free wireless and did my bizness, all the while listening to Hipster and Construction Guys chit-chatting. It wasn't until they got up, saying that it was time to head to work, that I realized their morning pick-me-up was not coffee but a tumbler of some sort of hard alcohol. No judgment here. Whatever gets you going in the morning. Just please be cautious with the heavy machinery! First of all this is a 3.5 review hopefully turning to 4/5 star ... I really liked the place and the atmosphere and of course the strong cocktails :) The restrooms were clean so that's a plus for me...couches I'll leave that to other yelper hehe ...Ipb I have to say I'm unimpressed. I don't understand why people say the atmosphere is pleasant or welcoming? It feels very confused and thrown together and some what run down.In a recent visit, I had some sushi which was OK. A little fishy but they did give me crab in the chef's choice vs. the obligatory prawn nigiri, which I did appreciate. I also indulged in a little absinthe which as usual was great, although stingy pour.The thing that left the worst taste in my mouth however was the credit card fee. After spending 50 bucks on food + drinks, and bringing along my 8 friends whom probably also spent 50+ each, they are going to nickle and dime me for a credit card fee? Sure, merchants do get charged a fee, and yes that should be passed along to customers to some degree - perhaps like coffee shops do with 25 cents for transactions under 5 dollars? On a 50 dollar bill I find this completely offensive, stingy, and unacceptable. No it isn't going to kill me to pay a 50 cent merchant fee, but the sheer profit made off of the beer my boy friend drank should have covered that fee 10 fold.
LOVE! &#160;I don't think that anything could have been improved. &#160;There are so many awesome things about this restaurant. &#160;It is my new favorite place! &#160;I was wandering Belltown with a few friends, and Spur was full so they recommended that we try Coterie. &#160;We started with the Heirloom Baby Carrots and the Marinated Beets. &#160;Both were delicious. &#160; The carrots had olives on top. &#160;An unusual pairing, but it was wondereful. &#160;The beets were marinated and served with cottage cheese and arugula. &#160;I could eat those all day! &#160;Perfection. &#160;Then we all shared the Zuchini Pasta Gratin. &#160;It was like a light zuchini lasagna. &#160;Thin slices of zuchini, layered with pasta and cheese, topped with pine nuts. &#160;SO GOOD! &#160;And we shared a bottle of Italian wine, Feudi di San Gregorio Lacryma Christi (translates to tears of Christ) and that was a excellent wine. &#160;The whole night was wonderful. &#160;Our server was attentive and very knowledgable. &#160;His name was Brandon and he was great. &#160;The atmosphere is really cool. &#160;I love every detail. &#160;The ceiling is even pretty. &#160;There is an amazing chandelier, part of one wall is alive (covered with various plants), and the lighting is pleasant. &#160;I love that you can see your food and the person that you are eating with. &#160;Sometimes minimal lighting is fine, but I hate it when the place is so dark you can't even read the menu. &#160;Basically, I love this place and can't wait to go back. &#160;GREAT RESTAURANT! poutine with braised pork shoulder + gravy + fried beechers cheese curds...yup, that'll make it the best poutine in Seattle for sure. sounds a bit fancy for poutine but it is sooo delicious! we wanted to order a side of the fried cheese alone.what we tried:1. poutine - you won't be sorry. 2. buttermilk fried chicken - so tender on the inside and perfectly fried on the outside. mashed potatoes with bacon. and the gravy....yea, this place does gravy well. 3. sablefish something - really soft and buttery (kind of like sea bass) with good flavor but a little too buttery for me.4. cod fritters - we were pretty full by the time we got these. pretty good but next time I'd try something else.5. the wine - some red wine from Spain... forget the name but it was so smooth and awesome. would definitely go back for the poutine alone. this place is surprisingly well lit (they definitely have nothing to hide because the dining room is beautiful) and you can actually hear the people you're talking to. a classy place - but cozy and inviting too! My husband and I came here on Thursday night. &#160;They had been open only 3 days. &#160;Our server was very attentive, very knowledgeable and welcoming. &#160;We started with the chic pea fries, cracklins and poutine. &#160;The chic pea fries and cracklins were amazing. &#160;The poutine was so close to perfect but we wanted gravy on the fries. &#160;The pork and the curds were amazing. &#160;The waiter explained in testing that putting gravy on the fries made them too soggy. &#160;I like soggy gravy fries. So maybe give us some gravy in a pitcher on the side and we can choose?? The reduced braising liquid from the pork shoulder maybe?? My scallops were cooked perfectly and I felt the dish showed great maturity and restraint. &#160;Loved the cauliflower puree, sweetness from the sultanas and the briny fried capers. &#160;The portion was spot on as well.Husband had the steak, cooked perfectly.  Bonus points for the bartender, my husband loves Southern Comfort yet few places carry it these days, the bartender made a drink for him that tasted just like it! &#160;And when I ordered Amaro for an after dinner drink he came over and tasted us on the 3 varieties of Amaro, which really impressed us and helped make the night.Oh, and the 6he &#160;pack of beer for the crew is BRILLIANT. Yes, you tip your server but the unsung heroes sweating in the back working 10 plus hour days deserve a toast as well. &#160;Well done.. 1 star: The design. Bathroom hand towels neatly organized. Greenery wall is interesting - something nice about dining next to vegetation. Good seating arrangement with a long bar table overlooking the lower portion. Nice bar. WOW-chandelier. Brick building. Open kitchen. White top with darker undertones/floor.+1 star: Food: yummeh! The Painted Hills burger had nice flavor and that sun-dried tomato was unique! I don't think I've had that in other PH burgers before. The salad plated with the burger (i forget, it's a top one on the central portion of the menu) was tasty. The side fries I got are rosemary flavored which = a delight.+1 star: Drinks: Good water, no funny taste, etc. The Cocktail menu looked thirsty. I was tied between trying the one with apricot and the Crux... settled on the Crux. Simple, nice kick &amp; potency (w/e) and darn good.+1 star: Service: The bartender was cool, composed and friendly. Some might say he resembles Guy Pearce from the movies. My waitress was Debra. She was sweet and friendly---and cute glasses, to boot! I like a nice girl &amp; glasses combo, ha! ;) I'll definitely try and return for one of my leisurely lunch walks.+1 star: Miscellaneous crap! Lighting, colors, tones, bg music(?), the front host stand, the small touches, the location and stuff.-------//-------5 stars, wooooo! delicious! love the pork cracklins with truffle sauce. so decadent and delicious. foie torchon also very good - nice that it is served cold on a warmed piece of toast with the acidity of the sherry vinegar. most of all .. LOVED the fried chicken. crispy and perfectly salty on the outside and so tender, succulent and perfectly cooked on the inside. the light bright frisee salad and bacon hash that come with perfectly compliment the chicken. thanks coterie room for a delicious meal! and .. love the vertical garden :) Super yum. Food is delicious, service is superb. Love the latest from the Spur and Tavern Law folks, and while I miss Zoe in this space, I'm delighted that something more approachable took over. Will be here at least a couple times a month. 4 1/2 stars. It is no secret that my quest for brunch in Seattle has largely been unsuccessful (Except for Portage Bay, whose quality control is largely inconsistent). Enter Coterie Room. I saw duck eggs and a gratuitous amount of pork being used in five different ways and I knew we had a winner. Ham cracklings, bacon and cinnamon fritters with caramel sauce was AWESOME. Was with a few people and we got the grilled fennel sausage with polenta, the pork pancake on special, the smoked crab legs, and the duck beef hash. EVERY dish was well executed. My husband was kind of amazed at his duck egg being cooked perfectly to medium. There is no question about the food being absolutely excellent. However, service was a bit weird. Our waitress spilled a few ham cracklings on our table in serving, but made up for it by bringing us a second one for free. No big deal. But then I saw her break a dish later on at another empty table...and then after reading about the review with the spilt pot of mussels...I had to wonder if it was the same girl. I know that everyone has bad days and all...but if you're clumsy and/or not steady with your hands, waiting tables is probably not in your future. Being a big fan of Spur and Tavern Law I was excited to try this latest restaurant addition. Between two people we tried the cod fritters, mac and cheese, the burger, and the crab. Overall the food was good, but I was not overly impressed by the food or the selection. The mac and cheese is no where near as good as Tavern Law, the cod fritters were a good size, but lacked any real distinct flavor, and the crab dish was out of balance with too much bacon hollandaise and hash browns. What struck me the most as odd, and maybe a bit tacky is the six pack of beer for the crew. Since when is a 20% tip not appropriate for an enjoyed experience. What I did enjoy is the rosemary bread that they serve in the beginning and the potential to share family style dishes. omga+food tres excellentliz rokx I enjoyed the Poutine, cracklins, beets, scallops, trout, and wagyu plate with some friends and had the most amazing time! Everything about the place was fabulous, our server Brandon was great! I spoke to Liz about our wine choice and it perfectly fit to our delight! The uniforms were a bit much, but the spot was perfect all together! Stumble in at happy great drinks and food. &#160;So long Zoe we will see you on the hill but your replacement is fantastic and nicer atmosphere. &#160;Mac n cheese with duck ham? Hit me with block o cheese lovely dish. &#160;Beet salad with devine cowgirl cottage cheese and pistachios hello! &#160;You will love this place. &#160;Living wall is righteous. &#160;Have fun. Tried it again for brunch, and my sausage in polenta with soft cooked duck egg was great. &#160;The ham cracklins with truffle butter was good as well. &#160;My friend had the fried chicken sandwich which was not so good. &#160;The waiter took our two drinks off the bill since he forgot to service our table quickly; nice touch that we did not expect My husband and I live in Belltown and last night after much anticipation of it's opening, enjoyed our first meal at The Coterie Room. &#160;The staff is warm, friendly and helpful. &#160;Each of the items on the menu looked delicious and we had trouble deciding what to order. &#160;We ended up each ordering a "small plate" endive salad and then shared the "family style" mussels. &#160;The salad was amazingly fresh and dressed just right. &#160; The mussels were comparable to the quality that we've had in Spain, France and Belgium. &#160; The chorizo was yummy and the mussels were amazingly plump, white and tasty ( the portion was extremely generous)!! &#160; The pricing was very good given the quality and quantity of mussels. &#160;We enjoyed several " by the glass" wine selections. &#160;Not a bad glass on the menu it seems. &#160; Well done. &#160;Lastly, we most appreciated the pace of the service, not rushed, not piled up and extremely attentive. &#160; One negative is that it is was very noisy and only at half capacity. &#160; We will definitely be back!!! I'm not usually a big spender by any means at lunch time, but a friend convinced me to try a new spot and go beyond my usual $10 maximum. (Yeah, so I'm cheap. &#160;I work downtown so a week of lunches gets expensive fast.)Coterie did not disappoint with the three--entr&#233;e, salad and beverage--for $15 deal. &#160;I was already splurging a bit on price (in my eyes), so why not go for something fried? &#160;Away I went with a fried chicken sandwich with delectable aioli topping and a side of a beet salad. &#160;I wouldn't say the two paired well but I didn't care because they were so freaking good. &#160;The chamomile ice tea was disappointingly straight forward and almost flavorless, but, ya know - that's hard to avoid with chamomile. &#160;There was more good than I could eat, even after stuffing myself a bit beyond comfort. &#160;Lunch conversation was light since my friend and I were sharing moments with our sandwiches (she went with pork).My friend was celebrating a birthday and the waiter got word and surprised her with two free complementary desserts that I was lucky enough to partake in: doughnuts and sauce and a chocolate mouse pie. &#160;The doughnuts were slightly warm, light and fluffy and the apple caramel dipping sauce was good enough to eat alone. &#160;We were too full for the mousse pie, so took that to go back to work and I tried it the following day. &#160;Pretty good, but not earth shattering. &#160;Chocolate pie isn't my thing though. I enjoyed the classy atmosphere and was pleased to be seated next to the awesome living plant wall at the bar.I'll be back...if I'm just as impressed the second time around, I'll bump CR up to 5 stars. The sumptuous interior of a sleek, modern style architecture such as the Coterie just simply works. &#160;As we entered the dining area, the soaring ceilings, an elegantly designed chandelier and cleanly arranged tables gives an excellent first impression. &#160; The menu consists of three dining categories: &#160;small plates ($6-$12), entrees ($17-$35) and sharable meal platters ($24-$45). &#160;Additionally, you have adequate alcohol options for wine, cocktails and beer. &#160;GRILLED RIB EYE STEAK &#160;$35 - prepared medium rare and soft poached for maximum tenderness. &#160;Sides included a potato puree, whipped horseradish pudding and crispy thin, sweet onion strings. &#160;Meat just melted in my mouth with the smooth potato though the onion strings a tad too salty.TAYLOR SHELLFISH MUSSELS $21 - a generous amount of Mediterrean medium-sized shellfishies served out of a shiny pot. &#160;The rich broth contained plump and meaty mussel bellies, chopped "green" chilis and savory chorizo sausage. &#160;With delicious bread slices to dip into the goodness, how could you not love this choice?ESTRELLA DAMM $5 - a light beer beverage I enjoyed with the above meal. &#160;Refreshing and reminds me of Stella Artois beer. &#160;Nice choice.Top notch service, a friendly hostess and fabulous New American cuisine resulted in a more than favorable experience. &#160; I shall return for more soon. My girlfriend and I decided to go here for our anniversary dinner and I can honestly say it was one of the best meals I have ever had the pleasure to eat! The Endive salad was refreshing and crisp. The Pork Cracklins with truffle sauce were light as air and decadent as can be. Don't even get me started on the Sable Fish!! Cooked to perfection each buttery bite paired perfectly with the corn relish and sweet and juicy heirloom cheery tomatoes. The Scallops were cooked perfectly seared on both sides and rare in the center. The fried capers provided an amazing salty pop with each bite. Their servers were knowledgeable of the wine and dinner menus without being the least bit pretentious, very attentive as well.We will be going back! I can't wait to see their mid Fall menu! Chefs Brian McCracken and Dana Tough have done it again! &#160; When an old friend had mentioned that these Kats had opened yet another restaurant, I had to fly home to Seattle to indulge for myself. &#160;A trip rewarded with great service, fantastic wine and phenomenal food. &#160;We enjoyed a nice spicy Malbec, which was quit moderately priced. &#160;In my eyes, a good sign to a great evening are the Reidel glasses, and an approachable wine list.For starters I enjoyed the 'OUR VERSION OF POUTINE' &#160;which is braised pork shoulder gravy, fried Beecher's cheese curds and fries. &#160;This dish was so amazing that my pescatarian (only eats fish) companion even took a plunge into the gravy with several fries. &#160;An unspoken compliment to any chef.For dinner my companion found delight in flawlessly prepared SEARED SEA SCALLOPS in brown butter with caramelized cauliflower, cauliflower puree, pickled sultanas and fried capers. &#160;Not only was this dish aesthetically pleasing to both of us, the flavors married perfectly. &#160;Not to mention the great lengths one must stride to find the perfectly cooked scallop. &#160;Applause placed here!As for myself. &#160;Well it seems to me that so few restaurants entertain the idea that so many of us actually do enjoy duck. &#160;Or rather should I say, we (the general foodie population) enjoy duck done right! &#160;Typically &#160;when I see duck, the menu goes down and I am ready. &#160;Period, end of story. At our dinner, this was no exception. &#160;My enthusiasm continued to bubble as I enjoyed the DUCK LEG CONFIT with buttered farro,arugula and a mission fig conserve. &#160;Now, for those of you that read my regular reviews and blog, you know it is a rare day that I say these words. &#160;This dish gave me the 'Foodie O Face' &#160;This dish was not only decadent, it offered a tranquility that even I can not put into words. &#160;Speaking of being at a loss or words. &#160;The final topic, &#160;Dessert! &#160;We asked our server to pair a wine with our dessert, which he did effortlessly. &#160;(On a side not, &#160;his service was just that. &#160;At one point, our table was marked for the next course, and I had not even noticed his stealth moves. &#160;A compliment to him alone for impressing me! &#160;By no means an easy feat!) &#160;Coming back to dessert. &#160;I forgot what he actually poured, not that the wine was unmemorable... rather that the Huckleberry Sorbet made by Chef Dana himself, much to my dismay and my companions delight, not only made me speechless, but also literally brought a tear to my eye. &#160; It is such a rare moment that I am silent, a tale my friend is enjoying to tell, just as I am boasting of this amazing new restaurant. &#160;Well done Gents! The Coterie Room is one of my new favorites. I had the honor of enjoying dinner for two at the table of honor (under the growing plant wall). The grow lights that keep the plants happy must have had an effect on me as I instantly settled into a good mood. The menu is fun and I appreciated the $10 act-of-kindness surprise towards the bottom.Everyone working that night was warm, all smiles, courteous and welcoming. The barman wore a familiar face from Tavern Law and he took a moment to welcome us and give us a cocktail consultation table side. I can't remember that ever happening to me before, and let me tell you that it's way better than any sommelier visit, which can make the calmest people cringe.Our food was up promptly and showed a lot of care and thoughtfulness. This place doesn't wear its sophistication on its sleeve, and I liked that it was unpretentious and yet full of detail. The portions were generous and I think these guys are off to a solid start. Opening night....Dear yelp, I beat all you bastards! I'm here first! I win! &#160;The lights were bright, the bartender....was a man. &#160;The food...porktastic! &#160;And the cheese, oh the cheese...yes. &#160;We drank liters from the wine forest, and joy was haveth. &#160;While floating the river of caramel ice cream, I pondered how I was to survive the army of cinnamon fritters marching side by side with apple caramel sauce. &#160;A unicorn ran across my path...in the form of foie. &#160;And amazing it was.
This is a Lunch reviewCame in today with a coworker, no one in the place. &#160;Ordered the following:Chicken Karage - &#160;Qualtiy 3 stars - no dipping sauce.Spider Roll - Quality 3 stars but received 1/2 the size compared to Japonessa, but roughly same price. Knock Roll - hamachi, avocado, cilantro, green onion, jalapeno - Qualtiy 2 stars and once again 1/2 size for same price and I don't think I had green onions or jalapenos was actually in this dish.miso soup - Qualtiy 3 starsServices was okay, had to ask for things such as tea and had to flag down waitress to pay for the meal. Considering she gave me the check and there was no one really in this place I am confused on why you would wait 10 minutes to go back to that table.Lunch for 2 = $32.00 and was still hungry.They need to work on quantity for price. So either make it bigger or drop the price of rolls by $2.00. &#160;Then I would be happy.Compared to other restaurants like Japonessa I am not planning on returning. completely mediocre. went for lunch today at 1PM, only person there. ordered a Bento. teriyaki and nigiri options - salad lettuce was old. sushi was decent. not worthy of all the 4 star reviews.
Yummy yummy yummy! Brunch on Sunday: so much well-cooked meats and (uncooked seafood)! Favorites: raw oysters, tri-tip, desserts (fruit tart &#160;+ lots of fruits + chocolate fountain). A little pricey, but worth it, especially if you have guests in town.Service was awesome, pleasant, and attentive. Our waiter even commented on this super piece of crab meat I managed to pull out of the shell. We like to stop here while cruising Lake Union on a nice summer day. &#160;I love, love, love the Whalemaker Lounge! &#160;Awesome service, yummy apps during happy hour, and strong mojitos all make this place a winner in my book! &#160;The chowder, popcorn shrimp, and pita tips and dips are my favorites. &#160;The edamame is good also, and the boys speak highly of the oyster shooters...however after drowning them in sriracha, I'm not sure exactly what they are tasting besides hot sauce.I hear great things about the Sunday brunch, but I have yet to try it...hopefully soon! Salmon was good! I'm from California and I don't even typically choose to eat salmon, but this is noticeably better! The cornbread was also served nice and warm. Eating with Immonology graduate students from UW in the private room also had a good feel with a very homely, cabin setting and the waterfront &#160;view. We came here for brunch on Sunday with a large group of friends. &#160;Our server was very attentive and everyone had a good time. &#160;We enjoyed the omelettes, ham, oysters, salmon chowder, etc. &#160;The chocolate fountain was entertaining too. &#160;The kids loved it and we even had someone make us chocolate covered bacon.... &#160;yumm! &#160;The crepes could use improvement and the prime rib didnt seem like prime rib... but it was alright. &#160;We'll be back again for sure! I personally have had nothing but bad experiences with Ivar's food. &#160;The exception being at their pricey Salmon House. &#160;I was skeptical going in, but left beyond satisfied. &#160;The food was abundant, the service was good for how busy they were, and it was one of those rare experiences where I was just like "omg I want to eat this forever! &#160;I don't ever want to not be eating this food!" &#160;I had the roasted chicken and they served an entire freaking half chicken for one person so that gives you an idea of portion size. &#160;The mashed potatoes were some of the best I have ever had. &#160;I don't know what they put in them, probably crack. &#160;They were amazing. This place is on the waterfront which provides beautiful scenery. &#160;That being said, the view is probably the best part about this place. &#160;I've only been to Ivar's with my friends a couple times and that was for the happy hour.The good:- Happy hour is 3:30 to close 7 days a week.- Lots of parking in their lot and across the street- Nice view of the water- Decent prices for happy hour foods and drinks.The BAD:- Service: absolutely horrible. &#160;We sat down at a table that was not yet cleaned because it was the only one that could fit our party. &#160;The waiter came and bussed the table but did not wipe it off with a rag. &#160;Crumbs and water stains everywhere. &#160;He even took our order without cleaning off the table. He said he was new as a waiter which meant he should have an experienced waiter watching after him making sure everything he does is up to the standard but i guess ivars does not have a standard for its staff..Overall, the experience was just alright. i'd rather go elsewhere to satisfy my seafood fancies. Went into Ivar's Salmon House for happy hour tonight; and was quite impressed. After walking into the Whalemaker Lounge which is first come seating, I was able to grab a seat in the bar for happy hour. However, I did not have a server approach myself for a drink order for roughly 10 minutes.Daily Happy Hour from 3:30 to Close; with $3.50 Drafts - (Stella, Mac and Jack, Hef, Bud Light, etc) along with very reasonable priced appetizers which were above average in size. Servers tried to do their hardest; but they just could not accommodate the throngs of customers in a timely fashion. I went here on a Saturday for Happy hour! First off who else in Seattle has a happy hour on the weekend? Nobody that I know of, please tell me if you do as well?It was a nice day outside to sit on the big deck next to the the water. Ordered a beer, then had most of the happy hour food. Which I have had all before at the Seattle waterfront Ivars. Lets just saw none of it was a disappointment at all. The food was all really well that I had. Have eaten there brunch buffet a couple times and i &#160;think it is better than saltys! The crab legs are great as well as the omlette station and pasta bar. &#160;Having a love for bananas foster i was delighted to find out you can get fresh made bananas foster at the crepe bar!!As far as price it is about 25 bux but it is still cheaper than saltys. &#160;This is my brunch buffet of choice My order of Cod and Chips looked like it was wearing a frown and tasted like a warm, soggy, baked fish stick from the school cafeteria.I was pretty disappointed, but listening to the drunks at the bar ramble on to no one in particular was distracting but not enough to bring me away feeling like I got conned by the waitress. The food here isn't anything special, but you can't beat the view from the deck or the number of hours each night you can spend deliriously happy in the Whale Maker Lounge. From 3:30 til close, small and big bites will only set you back between 3 and 10 bucks a plate, and pints of good-quality beer (Stella, Manny's, Mac &amp; Jack's, Hefe, etc.) are a mere $4.Avoid the soggy, pallid fish and chips, and get the Kahlua pork sliders or the salmon tostada instead. The $5 double cheeseburger is also a tasty bargain. And if dessert is what you're craving, try the choco-dipped cannoli w/ an irresistible $2.75 price tag. &#160;In order to snag a spot on their ever-popular deck, get here early--especially on a sunny day. there's nothing like looking out on to gorgeous Lake Union, with the skyline in the backdrop and a cold one in your hand. The Whalemaker Lounge is one of my favorite spots for happy hour. In the summer they open the dock outside with ample seating. You HAVE to order the smoked salmon chowder. I am not a big fan of salmon but it is one of the BEST chowders in town (I add a little tobasco to make it extra special).service is averagemost of the happy hour items are goodgreat view full bar Our favorite Sunday Brunch! &#160;Oysters on the half shell, dungeness crab, shrimps, mussels, roast lamb, of course salmon in so many ways, and a large assortment of your typical brunch style foods. &#160;It's all good! &#160;Great array of desserts, too! &#160;And my kids are happy that they also include their fish bar standbys -- fish &amp; chips and their signature clam chowder.We've been going for years, the place my mom always chooses to celebrate her birthday.The waitstaff are always friendly and accomodating, too! We had lunch from the takeout window out front. It was a beautiful summer day and couldn't resist sitting outside. My husband had the salmon 'n chips...pretty good but seemed sacrilegious to deep fry salmon. I had the grilled salmon on a bed of wild rice. The salmon was a bit overcooked and a little on the dry side. The rice was really chewy (glad we ordered the large Coke tartar sauce was yummy. I would've like some fresh lemon juice for my salmon. The stuff they had is like the juice you get from the plastic lemon in the grocery store (yuck). Since you've taken the time to read my review, here's a tip...once you're done eating, take a stroll down to the water's edge. There's a large, beautiful, wooden bench there with a gorgeous view of the city. The dazzling views of Lake Union, watching the languid wavelets lap at the shore, seeing the sun and waves and rain cross the lake with the Space Needle in the back round, strolling past manicured rhodies on the way in, enjoying the soaring cathedral like wood entrance with aboriginal art. This truly is an experience destination. We were here for a wine tasting dinner featuring Oregon Pinot Noirs and variously prepared courses of Copper River Salmon and it was A+ fantastic! The staff was attentive, friendly, delightful. Terrific place! Pure Seattle. Unfortch, I gotta keep it real and attach a disclaimer on my previous overstatement:"They serve happy hour from 3:30 till close... wait for it... SEVEN. DAYS. A WEEK." Note that this is only true in the fall and winter, and not in the sunnier and more happenin' spring and summer. As Seattle as you can get. You can't beat salmon lunch platter on the outside patio overlooking Lake Union on a gorgeous summer day. &#160;Though, my salmon was a bit dried and overcooked, I can handle that in exchange to the atmosphere. &#160;The interior is super cool, nicely decorated with actual hanging canoes, wooden carved fish, and pictures/portraits of the native Americans including one of Chief Seattle. &#160;I would love to come here for happy hour drinks/dinner. Best way to eat on a lake - with delicious drinks, great happy hour specials (starts up again at 9 pm in the summer), and the best fish and chips ever! &#160;Lightly breaded, crispy, non-greasy, and fresh tasting! &#160;The meat fell off the bones of the pork ribs and were well-flavored. &#160;Their clam chowder is good, but not as good as Pike's Place chowder. &#160;Reservations are very necessary during peak hours - we needed them on a Thursday night for dinner. &#160;Parking can be a hassle due to its popularity, and I've been told that it's a popular spot for nearby University of Washington faculty. &#160;The decor is nice - on the upscale side but still with a casual, friendly feel. &#160;When the weather's nice, I would try to eat outside - people will cruise up and down in their boats, reminiscent of cars on Sunset boulevard. &#160;Check it out if you're in the area! Ivar's has been around Seattle for over a century...and there are plently of reasons why. Beginning with the fact that the food is the best quality for your dollar. You will always be greeted with great customer service, a staff that is both friendly and professional, very knowledgeable and willing to accomadate. I asked for my calamari sauteed/grilled instead of fried and they were eager to do so.I love the fact that they offer happy hour in their bar, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. 3:30 to close...doesn't get much better than that. $3.50 for a glass of their house Cab? Yes please!Great seafood, oysters, salmon, crab, mussels, clams, scallops...all fresh and delicious, never overcooked. Plus a great view of downtown Seattle.I definitely will have to return for their regular dinner and their Sunday brunch buffet. Good job Ivars for continuing to be a Seattle institution! Though a bit pricey, i love taking my out of town guests here.Sunday Brunch is never a dissapointment at such a beautiful place with a great view. OMG smaller fish portions! &#160;Atmosphere over food quality. &#160;The recession must have hit Ivar's too! &#160;I had the Salmon Sampler this week &amp; I asked the waiter, "What happened to the rest of the fish?" &#160;The Salmon Sampler used to have 3 pieces of fish...now they give 2 much smaller pieces! &#160;Ouch! &#160;I'm still hungry! &#160;So, get the salad too...so you don't starve to death. &#160;(The salad is additional, as is the clam chowder.) &#160;Parking is available and the view is great. &#160;It's more of an ambience thing with the lake view and NW Native art around. &#160;Nice NW experience, but you do pay for it. &#160;Bring that credit card! &#160;lol Never heard this place before... but seems like a popular place?When they told us to meet at Ivar's for brunch I was like - what? Ivar's? The fish and chips place? um...Really, we didn't know...and to my surprise this place is full (or am I the only one who doesn't know about this place?)Many choices but I wasn't blown away by anything particular. &#160;Prime rib, lamb, 3 types of salmon, shrimp cocktail, friend fish &amp; chips, omelet station, veggie, pasta, fruit, and your old fashion breakfast choices like sausage, egg Benedict , and french toast... list goes on. &#160;With the 25.00 per person price, I am not sure I will come back for brunch because... really, how much mediocre food can your stomach hold? &#160;Or maybe I was distracted by the newborn, new friends, non-stop talking... I only got 2 plates and I was done. &#160;Not that I was full, just lack of interest in the food they served. :(Overall, great view of Lake Union, lots of food choice. &#160;Not my first choice for brunch. The chowder is always great at Ivar's. It's definitely a Seattle staple. We had a mini-high school reunion this weekend and a bunch of friends gathered at Ivar's for lunch.I ordered the chowder and Caesar salad combo and that was pretty standard. It was $12... Some people ordered the salmon and the crab melt, the crab melt looked so delicious, it was huge too.The restaurant itself is really beautiful, in my opinion. It has a great view of the water and you can kind of see Gasworks too, but definitely a great view of the Needle and people kayaking on Lake Union. That makes the deck a great place to sit and enjoy the sunshine in the summer time. The interior has a very Pacific Northwest feel to it with all the wood and totem poles decor.The service was great but one thing that was a little gross was that some of us had dirty utensils (I really hate that). But nevertheless, everyone seemed to enjoy the restaurant and their meals.I do want to try their Sunday brunch though, I've heard great things about it. A few of us decided to hit up the happy hour in the lounge area for a late night meal since the restaurant closes the main dining area at around ten in the evening. The lounge was relatively packed, but we were able to find a table for four near the windows facing Lake Union. Also, there is an outdoor area with an equal amount of tables as the indoor lounge area, but on a Friday night for happy hour, it is inevitable that you would find yourself fighting for seating.However, the happy hour prices were a bit expensive and a relatively small entree of fish and chips would set you back about seven dollars. Three small pieces of cod and half a handful of fries for seven dollars? There are definitely other places a bit further towards the University of Washington campus where you could find a more decently sized meal for the same amount. In addition, the group fared well with oyster shooters and would have probably ordered more, but we found that our money was better spent on three dollar draft beers.Our advice is to take advantage of the rare warm nights of the summer season and chill on the outdoor deck. The outdoor deck is more conducive for conversation especially with larger groups. OMG i cannot believe I haven't reviewed Ivar's yet! &#160;I've only been there ohhhhhhhh # of times equal to the # of Duck Dodge races I've attended + several more times. &#160;... I'm guessing... 15?Happy hour deal is great. &#160;Oyster shots yum. &#160;Chicken quesadilla yum. &#160;Beer yum. &#160;Beef sliders yum. &#160;Waitresses... yum. I came back here for my mom's birthday dinner, and although service was on the iffy side , overall it was great! &#160;One aunt had the shrimp pasta and it was excellent (I inherited the leftovers). &#160;Both my mom and the second aunt had one of the halibut dishes since it was in season. &#160;I had one of the halibut specials substituting king salmon, and it was delicious-- just as good as the famous Etta's salmon I'd tried a few nights prior. &#160;The crab appetizer dish was tasty as well, plus the wine flight was fun. &#160;They also gave my mom a free slice of cheesecake for her birthday, and even though we were too stuffed to eat it, it was a nice gesture.The dining room is definitely on the expensive side so my loyalty is to the within-my-price-range bar menu, but I'd come back for a special occassion. My winter time Ivar's haiku:On a rainy night:Happy hour delectablesAre cheap, plentifulMy summer time Ivar's haiku:Gazing at the lakeOn a sunny dayHappy hour food tastes better Are you ready for a Sunday-brunch-food-baby? Then get your loose pants and head to Ivar's!Ivar's has a great view with the Eastlake bridge, Lake Union, and downtown Seattle. Plus, with a sunny day, you get to watch tons of boats with their eager passengers, ready for some vitamin D. The ambiance is warm with its natural wood/logs and Native American decor. The restaurant isn't too big, so it felt more intimate and family friendly, without feeling claustrophobic. The servers are polite and generally attentive.The food was great! They had a large variety of salads, antipasti, fruit, and general American fair items. There were two different kinds of crab legs and other tasty seafood items. I really liked their eggs benedict (the sauce had an interesting kick) and I swear their creme brulee was lavender infused. Plus - $2 wine-glass sized mimosa FTW! At $25 per person, I say, "Yes - please!" to Ivar's Sunday Brunch! I now can answer the most dreaded question with confidence: where is the best brunch in Seattle? It is here! The price was $15 less per person than the most famous brunch in Seattle, but the atmosphere and food were worth so much more. I had lamb, king crab, dungeness crab,eggs Benedict, crepes, and the most wonderful fresh fruit. It was great.Totem poles watched over us while we dined. Our server, Rosa, was so friendly and attentive. The bussers were on top of things too. I never needed to worry about our table getting buffet overload.I can't wait to bring out of town guests here... Actually, I can't wait to go again myself. A "whale maker" this place is, specifically the Whalemaker Lounge; for it is a place of happy moments, mixed with perhaps a fading appeal. &#160;For the longest time, this was the place to be, after a long day studying and trying to stay awake. &#160;The knowledge that with books put away, I would find myself and my friends here would motivate us to study hard, with a delicious reward to be had. &#160;This was the Happy Hour location, which we all went to, for its amazing deals and late night goodness. This was my first time coming back in a long time. &#160;The good; the food is still delicious; there isn't a doubt about that. &#160;The chowder is still wonderful to have; the fish and chips are perfectly cooked, with a ton of flavor. &#160;Their mix of house cocktail concoctions are good for the ladies and their choice of draft and well drinks are solid. &#160;I don't ever think there was ever a time when I thought the food was lacking in anyway. &#160;What makes the lounge great, is the view of the water, inside the bar and the outdoor seating is always nice, especially on a sunny day. What has left me possibly looking outside of this place is the need for better happy hour value. &#160;While not any more expensive than other places of equal quality, it's gone up from when I was in college. Okay fine, it's been like 4 years, but it doesn't have the same value/benefit I used to give up my nights for. &#160;Okay, maybe I'm just complaining that their prices have gone up since I was there last, but it's a happy hour, and I think it should be a very happy price. &#160; I just want to say, the food there is still yummy and delicious, and it's a Seattle Must do. So we drove up to this shacky looking place, but the restaurant is on the water side and beautiful. My daughter found what turned out to be a favorite version of chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies. Yum.I, however decided to try the in-season Halibut over pasta that was $20. The halibut was bland and tender, and the pasta was terribly garlic flavored. They did not go together. And when asked, our waiter admitted the garlic does vary by cook. When I got the bill, the dish was $30--in my old age I had misread the menu--Definately NOT a $30 meal. Very disappointed. Wish I'd ordered the Fish and Chips. 3 stars for ambience, 2 stars for service, 3 stars for chicken(at a salmon house,) and no stars for the overpriced halibut/pasta special. I visited Salmon house on a 04/23/10, Friday afternoon for lunch.Parking: Free and ampleService: GoodFood: GreatWe ordered:WILD ALASKAN COHO SALMON &amp;ALDER GRILLED WILD ALASKAN SOCKEYE SALMON.Will be uploading pictures for both. the food was absolutely amazing and the service was great. I highly recommend this place. A little pricy for some of the items but great. I had the coho and it was amazing. Go try it I love Ivars. &#160;I love the waterfront location, the fast food places in the mall, the Mukilteo location, etc. &#160;I was super excited to have a nice Ivar's dinner at the Salmon House on Northlake. &#160;The views are incredible, and the location is fairly easy to get to.The food was, well, okay. Maybe I was tainted by the piggish waiter who described one dish to me as tasting like sex. &#160;Yes, he told me that the halibut topped with truffle oil would taste like sex. &#160;No thanks. &#160;I think I'll stick with the chowder from here on out. I love the pacific northwest comfortable ambiance of this Ivar's restaurant. I tried the happy hour here with some friends a couple months ago and it was a great deal. The food was so cheap and tasty. On the other hand, a group of us had the new years brunch here and the food was less than stellar. It was food I could have eaten at Denny's or Ihop. Because I had great experiences here before I was very disappointed to see how poor the quality of food was for their brunch. The happy hour is a must try but I don't know if I will be back for a regular meal here. Had the copper river salmon here, it was delicious! The view was very nice as well! Don't judge a book by its cover. &#160;The outside of the restaurant looks a little run down, but the inside is gorgeous. &#160;The view of the city is nice, too. &#160;I had the Mixed Grill entree' that had Salmon, Halibut, and Steak. &#160;The fish was wonderful, but the steak was dry and forgettable. &#160;The Smoked Salmon chowder was incredible. &#160;Waitress was very friendly and gave excellent service. I've always done happy hour, but never sat down for an actual meal there. But still just got a bowl of smoked salmon chowder. The service was great. We were seated quickly. I got enough chowder with my fresh ground pepper. My friends got fresh oysters and sockeye salmon entree. The only thing that would've made the dining experience better would've been if it was sunny outside and they opened up the outside deck. It was the usual, thick, rich salmon chowder. The salad could've been better. It was my first time having oysters, and it was really good. U got to love the alderwood grilled salmon. The brown rice was just ok, a little dried out. The grilled asparagus was edible but the salmon triopaired with the organic hard cider and fresh baked sweet cornbread was perfect. The view was 5 star. I OD'd on their crack clam chowder at Sunday brunch. &#160;Ivar's is quintessential Seattle and it makes me all warm and fuzzy. &#160;They have THE brunch buffet. &#160;What do you want to eat? &#160;They have it all, &#160;Never ending crab? &#160;Check. &#160;Meat carving station? &#160;Check. &#160; How about a made-to-order omelet or crepe? &#160;Check. &#160;Salmon a thousand ways? &#160;Check. &#160;Chocolate fountain? &#160;Uh, yes. &#160;Bacon, sausage, waffles, pasta, desserts, on and on and on......for only $25. &#160;Brunch is my favorite, but they also have an awesome happy hour, delicious seafood lunch and dinners and beautiful views of Lake Union. I came here for lunch with some co-workers and had the classic 3 piece fish and chips. Sitting on the water on a 90 degree day eating fish is just about perfect. I would recommend this spot to anyone in the area looking for a quick semi inexpensive meal. The nice weather makes this place even better because you can sit right next to Lake Union. i usually come here with my friend for some very good happy hour food, but this time, i took my family here for sunday brunch. &#160;for $25 a person and no charge for my toddler son, this was definitely a deal. &#160;i can't begin to describe how much food there was here. &#160;8 different kinds of salads, cheese and meat platters, fish n chips, clam strips, prime rib, ham, dungeness and snow crab, prawns, smoked salmon and grilled salmon, omelettes and eggs to order, hush puppies, cooked veggies, waffles, eggs benedict, sausage, bacon, potatoes, dessert platters, a chocolate fountain, this brunch basically offered almost everything the salmon house had to offer. &#160;the best part, everything was delicious. &#160;be wary though, this is a very busy sunday event. &#160;however, there's plenty of parking. &#160;the service was so-so for us, a lot of the time, we had to ask for water and drinks to be refilled and our dishes to be cleared. &#160;other than that, it was a fantastic meal and we will be back again This review is only for the Ivar's to go portion outside of the Salmon House. Attended a function on the floating ferry next door and decided to drop in for a bowl of chowder before hand. I love Ivar's chowder. Much better "in the flesh" than the frozen version available from Costco. &#160;Shame i wasn't aware of the smoked salmon chowder everyone seems to be talking about in their reviews. Next time, next time. As of this post there are 222 reviews for Ivars Salmon House. Do we really need another..? Ok, I'll be quick....sort of. &#160;If you want to take some out of town friends to a great local seafood joint and DON"T want to hassle with the downtown Seattle waterfront spots then here you go. You can get there easily, parking is mostly a piece of cake and once inside, its a perfect place to chill..Its not called a Salmon house for nothing. The menu is loaded with...salmon. Other stuff too..steaks and crab.and of course the old low-budget favorite..chicken. .Not the best place if you're out on a tight budget. Seafood is just flippin' expensive and can jack the dinner ticket up a bit. 4 people and a couple of circuits of drinks can put you're tab into the 150 plus area. If you go at it conservatively, you'll get out for far less...and if thats too much then there is the walk-up seafood bar on the street side of the building...also excellent too by the way..Not a real good place to bring the young kids. The menu just doesn't support that part real well..No burgers or mac n' cheese.. I thought the brunch buffet was really good...I'll go back for sure! Great seafood, great ambiance. &#160;I've been here several times, and I'm never disappointed. &#160;The restaurant interior decor is very cool, you could spend an hour just walking around Ivar's admiring the decor, photos and Native American art. &#160;The view of Lake Union, boats, and the Seattle skyline are amazing. &#160;The food is delicious! &#160;The clam chowder, salmon, fish and chips, shrimp pasta, crab legs, everything we have tried has been delicious. Great Happy Hour. &#160;Great View. &#160;Great Bar. Liked it so much we ate here 3 times in one week, sort of. We were brought here with a larger group for Monday night dinner by some locals and really enjoyed our meals. The trio platter made it's way around the table and the crabcake was especially tasty. I tested the kitchen with the Two Tiradito platter of salmon carpaccio and was very happy with the presentation and flavors. I stayed traditional for my entree and was rewarded with a delicious piece of salmon in a silky smooth buerre blanc with simply asparagus and morel accompaniments. My wife started with the award deserving salmon chowder, and the fresh sockeye with cherries. Both quintessential WA flavor dishes, which is what we seek when traveling.Our 'second' visit was a return the same night for dessert. After settling into our hotels, I saw a facebook post from other friends who were in town, and just starting their appetizers. Since we were at the Silver Cloud, just across the lake, I called and asked if they wanted dessert company. &#160;I'm glad we did so we could share a very well done orange ginger creme brulee with them.Our third visit was on our last day in town, and my wife just had to have more of that chowder. This time we just ordered from the calm bar out front, and carried a chowder, salmon caesar salad, and halibut &amp; chips down to the lakeside tables to enjoy the delicious fresh fare and great views. We always seek out the local hangouts when we travel and avoid the restaurants that are more dependent on tourist traffic. The endorsement from our local friends was all it took to get us in the door, the great food and service got us to come back. Went here for Sunday Brunch. 2x in the last few months, not by choice. The crepes are the highlight by far. A lot of the food is so-so. It is not worth the price in my opinion, not even close. Especially after you factor in the mandatory 18% gratuity and the poor service we had. When I pay that much, I expect my drink to be kept full, not dying of thirst. Solid four stars. Service was a little slow late afternoon. But I was hungry and the waiter probably a little bushes after lunch. The food was great. Smoked salmon over organic asparagus and potatoes, salmon chowder, field green salad with balsamic vinegar. The view of downtown Seattle and the space needle superb as well. I came back and ate out front at the walk up grill two times also and sat on the back deck. Loved Ivar's which was recommended to me by a local. yum yum yum!this was what i was looking for in seattle! fabulous seafood! what a location!what an experince!what wonderful food!wonderful waitress! (Jun)a great end to a great trip to washington state.how i wish i didn't have to go home! This place is the all time Sunday brunch champ! It seems weird that an Ivars would be, but there is way more to this place then seafood my friends! This smorgasbord of delicious, savory, mouth watering brunch food goes as far as the eye can see at their buffet. They make omlets and crepes right in front of you and it's only made with the freshest best quality ingredients you can imagine. They have everything you can think of for breakfast/lunch; eggs (any way you want them), toast, waffles, pancakes, muffins, bagels, cheeses, bread, meats, seafood (of course) and all the extras that come along with the main dishes. Not only is the food great, the location is too! It's on the water and inside there is a lot of the native culture displayed including a approx. 60 ft. long hand carved canoe on the ceiling. there are paintings and pictures and it's very kid friendly as well! I have been going here since I was about 5 and I will continue to go until I am 55+! As long as they are in bussiness i will be a loyal customer. Great happy hour, delicious salmon and wonderful views. What else could I ask for? &#160;Menu is kind of limited, but don't let that stop you from coming in. &#160;This place is a must for any salmon fan! Outside dining by the fast food stand is not so good, however, it can be good it you have your pet dog along. &#160;I usually get the halibut fish and chips, although I'm not a big fried food type of person. &#160;They do have dining outside by the water too. &#160;This is very nice and feels luxurious when the weather is summer perfect. &#160;You can also eat indoor dining. &#160;Here is where I can get my grilled salmon. &#160;This makes me happy. &#160;So, if you want a place where you can get a nice view and have decent food, this is a place to go. &#160;Also, good to go to the outside eating area if you have your dog in hand. Yum yum . . . this is where I usually take out of town visitors who want casual seafood dining! Love the atmosphere (especially out on the deck with all the kayakers paddling by) and of course the fish and chips and clam chowder! We went here for happy hour and their prices are fairly decent. Love anywhere that has cider on their menu!
50% off sushi? Are you CRAZY? I'll take two califronia rolls and a spicy salmon please! Screw whatever flavor-of-the-week pandemic is being spread through the airwaves; I'll take my chances with day old sushi when I can get two rolls for $3. Even the fresh stuff is obviously not that expensive, being no more than $4-5 for the fancier rolls.Working right up the street, I find myself waking down to this fantastic eatery and having myself a nice little sushi meal. I've only visited the sushi part of the market, so my review is only based on this.Note: Debit card payments have a $5 minimum, so if you're just getting a couple rolls - better snag another one to meet the limit. Get out the way Uwajimaya, here comes Maruta! From my co-worker's suggestion, I decided to try this "Asian Deli". &#160;Less than 5 minutes away from my work, I was ecstatic to find this place. &#160;Like Uwajimaya everything was very fresh on the other hand unlike Uwajimaya, everything was super affordable. &#160;They have two sections to the store a regular market and a take out restaurant. &#160;I saved the trip to take out restaurant for the next time and walked into the market. &#160;A regular Japanese centric market with great deli selections. &#160;They had amazing selection of prepared Nigiris and rolls all the way to 3-4 different kinds of Donburis. &#160;I picked up a large Beef Don and two large Vietnamese Salad Rolls for ONLY $8. &#160;Yes, it is true. &#160;Going to Uwajimaya with $8, you may be able to get a pack of fancy Asian gum. &#160;:) &#160;I was very impressed. &#160;They also had all kinds of Japanese and Asian dishes already prepared ready to be heated up. &#160;I just sat down and polished the food I got and it was delicious. Affordable AND delicious? &#160;Deserves a 5 in my book. &#160;I was asking my co-worker why he managed to tell me NOW. YAY- bf picked up dinner from this place - he texted me a few weeks ago saying he found a hidden gem....and it really is! I have never been there but boy, it is super cheap &amp; pretty tasty. Which is always a score w/ me!The rolls aren't the best, too much rice- but hey, they were more than half the price of what you normally pay - say like at uwajimaya.The chicken karage was really good &amp; so was the sashimi - salmon &amp; tuna. Had sake with the meal &amp; topped it off with green tea mochi ice cream :)He said the fresh items were affordable, but the other grocery items aren't a huge bargain. Best take out in town! Their sushi is fresh, tasty and best of all CHEAP! Like Uwaji's they discount their leftovers at 5pm, it's amaizing how much food you can get for $5. I love this mom and pop store and their staff is very friendly. What a great Japanese grocer and takeout! &#160;It is a little small, so might not have everything you want, but their take-out food is good and not too expensive, especially at the end of the day. &#160;They also make fresh mochi for New Year's day. Maruta Shoten is a nice Japanese grocery and take-out. It kinds of reminds me of a store back home in Honolulu called Tanabe Suprette which has a similar setup. Maruta has groceries located on the left side of the store and a take-out area on the right hand side along with the produce and sashimi/fish. Near the take-out area, there are items including bento boxes of teriyaki chicken and salmon along items like tempura and sushi. All of which are reasonbly priced and about the price of a plate at a teriyaki restaurant, as well as being more authentic Japanese food. Overall, I would recommend Maruta as a one stop shop for Japanese grocery and eats.
Spicy Beef Noodle Soup. Say it with me now: "Spicy Beef Noodle Soup."This is what you should order if you come to Chen's and you want to eat something delicious.if you don't eat beef or noodles, I feel sorry for you... but there are plenty of other fantabulous items on the menu of which I've heard lots and lots... and lots of good things about.(Hello, salt and pepper wings, I'm talkin' 'bout you).Come to Chen's. Eat great food. Let Tom or Rylee, or any of the other lovely folk here take care of you. Great people. Great food. What more do you need? ...if you're looking for an answer... than I'm still feeling sorry for you. With Miss Rylee O. holding court and a handful of Yelpers holding up the bar, Chen's is full of love. Beer is cold, service is top-notch and with the Best of Celebrity Roasts on the big screen, what can there be to complain about. See you next Sunday. Chen's is a reminder that beauty is on the inside. &#160;I had the pleasure of joining some yelpers at Chen's after the Big Al event to eat some tasty appetizers, drink some refreshments and pay Miss Rylee O. a visit.The regulars, who were holding the bar down, seemed quite pleased to see a large crew roll in on a Sunday evening. &#160;Friendly regulars? &#160;I like.The food was tasty with a capital tasty. &#160;I sampled chow mein, salt &amp;peppered chicken wings, egg rolls &#160;and other grub. &#160;All of which, gets a big thumbs up and chow down from me.The bartender, our own Rylee O., was making drinks and serving food like the best of them. &#160;She was always friendly and sweet and anticipated what our wild crew may need.While the building itself may be rough around the edges, the food, drinks and service are divine. Chen's looks a bit rough on the outside and the inside. You have to go through an obstacle course to get to the bar which looks like its been around for a while with patrons of the same line. The food is reasonably priced and cheap and they have the nicest bartender on the planet. I had the lovely pleasure of going to Chen's with a group of Yelpers. Rylee, being one of our own, greeted us with a warm smile. We all took a seat and ordered drinks. I browsed the menu and found a small vegetarian section. Nothing really stood out so I went with the veggie chow mein. There was a bit of a wait but I doubt the cooks were expecting about 20 people to show up at once. When the food arrived it was plentiful. I dipped my fork in and liked what I tasted. This isn't gourmet food here by any means but it certainly hits the spot. Needing more food I ordered egg rolls, which are meat free, and were hot, greasy, and crunchy, exactly how an egg roll should be. Someone didn't want their asparagus anymore so I gladly took them off her hands. They were drowning in a brown sauce and were accompanied by onions. They were flavorful with the right touch of sweet and sour.Chen's has a jukebox with a variety of musical genres. There is a pool table and a flat screen television. I like Chen's for the relaxed atmosphere, good cheap food, and great staff. Just a note for the fellows, you get to pee in a trough full of ice. Right on. In all fairness, I've only ever sat at the bar when a fellow Yelper (Rylee) was bar tending. That being said, I'm quite sure the service would be fabulous even if I didn't know her!Drinks are always made well, the food is yummy, and the service is great. Parking can be a bit crappy when the place is busy, but there's some street parking nearby. The decor is a bit old school, but it just provides a fun atmosphere to be in! Unassuming much?I have heard plenty of things about Chen's in the past, but only managed to make it to one of the Yelpy events there this month.And? That bar is where it's at! I doubt I would have ever gone into that building if I didn't know I'd find friends there, so I'm glad they were there... and I'm glad I did.The bartender was friendly and very helpful as I was trying to pick a beverage. The people there... even ones that I had never seen before... were very happy people. Shortly after walking in a guy put down $20 and said "jello shots all around!" Those $1 jello shots were quite tasty! I smiled when, on the way out, some other guy at the bar that I'd never seen or spoken to said "Bye! Nice to meet you!"My kamikaze was killer strong and only $5. It was happy hour so all the apps were half-priced. The assorted platter (with fire in the middle!) looked good, but I settled on some hot &amp; sour soup (not on HH menu) and potstickers. The food was fine. Filling. I tried some of the veggie fried rice a friend ordered and it was goooood. Guess I'll have to try one of the entrees next time I'm there!Thank you Chen's for being a hidden treasure! What first struck me abou Chen's was how friendly everyone is - the host, the waiter, the bunch of cute smiley kids hanging around - everyone was really welcoming and happy. That's a big plus.The ambiance is plain, but who cares - everything was clean and nice, so that works.I have to say the food wasn't my favourite, but that's based a lot on personal preference - a lot of people really want the heavier, fried, sugary Chinese food, and that's what we got, but I was really hoping for something fresh and a bit healthier. My lemon chicken was breaded, fried, and really heavy, in a sort of sweet syrup that was only a little lemony. My boyfriend's almond chicken was equally heavy, fried, and not too almondy. That could have been bad ordering, too, mind you - in the interest of $$$ we ordered from the specials menu which is (understandably) limited.Everyone was so nice, and I hear great things about Chen's for happy hour and cocktails, that I'm sure I'll be back - but I'll order more carefully next time, and hopefully not feel quite so rock-in-the-tummy when we leave.Not the best Chinese food I've had, but far from the worst, and a place so nice it'll be worth trying again. Ok, 5 stars for a place that isn't much of a looker from the outside?As Napoleon Dynamite would say, heck yes.In my need to get my lazy ass out of my lazy ass mode, I decided to go say hi to Rylee and get some food to go. I am so glad I did. I have eaten here before, but wow. Tonight was something all kinds of special. I got the salt and pepper chicken wings and the house fried rice.OMG OMG OMG. So yum. It was piping hot even when I got home to Kirkland, and I have plenty to last me a couple meals. I will be back to get something else soon. Yes the service was great.Yes everyone was friendly.Yes I liked the food ( not a big drinker).But good lord the bathrooms. Um yeah. Listen. While being somewhat frightened in the bathroom I wracked my brain trying to figure out how it got that way when obviously people worked there. I wondered if next time I came (if I ever got over this) how big of a bag I would need to bring to hide the duster, duct tape, screw driver, lysol wipes,air freshener, windex, paper towels...but would I have time before the staff kicked me out thinking I had some kind of fetish?We too got almond chicken and lemon chicken like another reviewer from their very,very,very reasonably priced lunch menu. And it was good. Generally , in my limited experience, neither of those dishes are really meant to be done in panko but it wasn't bad. Very filling. &#160;I mean very. Perhaps in these trying economic times people are trying to give you more for your money? ?Well bless 'em. But if I do come back I will have to bring lysol wipes to clean the bathroom stall door. Yeesh. Salt and pepper chicken, crab rangoons, and a cheap lunch menu of absolute win! &#160;My favorite here is the dry sauteed string beans, it's so delicious. the fried rice is so - so, but who can beat &#160;an egg roll and egg flower soup &#160;to go with it too? &#160;always ready on time to go , and the servers are always awesome &#160;and polite. I love this place so much I moved next door.Very tasty food at a reasonable price. Or is it Chen's Llage as the outside of the building suggests? &#160;:)Definitely don't let the facade repel you, what Chen's may lack on the outside with their weather worn face or on the inside with the cracked vinyl seating and dark atmosphere they make up for in long strides with their warm service, stiff drinks and incredibly yummy food! &#160;But isn't this the formula for most great Chinese Restaurants? &#160;We made our way through the little interior maze and enjoyed our meal in the bar served by Yelp's own Rylee O. &#160;She was an impeccable hostess, balancing drink and food orders from a group of rowdy Yelpers. &#160;The company certainly couldn't be beat. &#160;In Dude fashion we drank White Russians and kept the juke box rolling, all that was missing was the rug! &#160;I must mention that there is also a pool table here of which I'll need to return and partake of. &#160;Serious grubbage occurred here, and this was needed after filling our gullets with beer earlier and then advancing the the White Russians. &#160;Not usually the best combination! &#160;Thus the serious meal balanced us out nicely. &#160;We enjoyed the Salt and Pepper Chicken WIngs immensely! &#160;These are a must try for sure and I'm so glad Miss V. ensured they ended up on our table. &#160;Then a basic meal of Almond Fried Chicken, Crisp Dry Sauteed Green Beans and Orange Beef was passed around and consumed with smiles and resulted in happy bellies! &#160;This food was solid, good quality meats and flavorful seasonings in the sauce and gravy. &#160;I was very much impressed and will definitely be back to get my grub on. I don't usually eat here, but rather call in and grab my order on the way home. &#160;I have never been disappointed and must say that this place tops my list for Chinese food here in Seattle. &#160;Having lived in San Francisco most of my life, I am used to fantastic Chinese and Chen's is pretty close to what I am used too.Forget that the place looks like a cockroach infested dump from the outside...the food is what it's all about. This place does not look glamorous inside and outside. &#160;In fact, it looks pretty sleazy. &#160;But it really took me by surprise. &#160;The food is really good. &#160;The kung pao chicken, my customary order, was incredibly spicy and tasty. &#160;I recommend a supply of kleenex on hand when consuming that dish, you'll need it. &#160;A great place to go for lunch, they have great deals during the lunch hour. &#160;Check it out. My first impressions of Chen's were of great intrigue. From the outside, it looks like an unlikely place for a Chinese restaurant. The building from the outside appears to be a bit rundown. Entering the restaurant, I am greeted by a very 70's retro looking dining room. As for the menu itself, it is a mish-mash of American Chinese and slight more authentic Chinese food. Ordering from the lunch special menu, I do also see a number of teriyaki items on there include teriyaki chicken and chicken katsu. Not items you would see on a traditional Chinese restaurant menu.I ended up deciding on having the ma-po tofu. The entree came with a choice of soup (hot/sour or egg drop), a choice of fried or steamed rice and a egg roll. The egg drop soup and egg roll that I had was okay. As for the ma-po tofu itself, it was spicy as advertised which was a bit too much. &#160;Though I liked that they put a lot of chili peppers into the dish. Overall, I thought the food I had here was okay and the service was friendly. I would consider Chen's again if I was in the area looking for quick Chinese food. On one particularly starving afternoon, I called Chen's and placed a delivery order. The guy was at my doorstep in 12 minutes! Granted I live a few minutes away and I didn't order several entrees... but I still thought it was impressive. The food was delicious. One of the best pu-pu platters around. If you order it dine-in, it comes with a little fiery cauldron. The shrimp has a good crispy panko crust, potstickers are fat and flavorful, marinated beef skewers are tasty, chinese bbq pork is good, comes with about 5 different sauces. Man, did I miss anything?As for their other dishes, they have one of the better crab rangoons that aren't all just cream cheese. The salt and pepper chicken wings were crispy and pretty tasty. Very simple. We had the General Tso chicken last night and it was quite tasty. The chicken was well battered and fried, sauce was sticky, slightly sweet, and seasoned well. We may have ordered the wrong dry sauteed beans because there was only a hint of black bean sauce in the watery gravy and I was expecting the much more flavorful, slightly spicy version we had received in previous times. I will say they were perfectly cooked since they had that satisfying crunch but without the green flavor.There was a slight dip in quality and quantity earlier this year that made us wary, but last night's dinner reaffirmed Chen's as our favorite local Chinese takeout place. The only reason this place gets a 4 instead of a 3 is because I live in Seattle. If this was in San Francisco, it would definitely be knocked down a few notches. However, I still am desperately searching for decent cheap delivery/take-out Chinese, this place is the best I got. I have found that if you stick with a few items - you are good. I don't really like their veggie dishes, although you can't really go wrong with steamed broccoli. I give a solid thumbs up to their sesame chicken,broccoli beef, mu shu anything, and chow fan (or fun). Their chow mein leaves something to be desired, but nothing a little soy sauce wont cure. Pretty solid overall, until I find something better. Chen's is among the best dive bars in the city. &#160;Don't be fooled by the outside. &#160;Tasty affordable Chinese-American food and strong cheap drinks in the bar. &#160;I love love love the salt and pepper chicken wings. &#160;Also the pu-pu platter which comes with a tiny grill so you can heat your appetizers over the flame as you devour them. &#160;Happy hour is 3-7 every day. &#160;$2.75 well drinks, $2-$2.50 beers, 1/2 priced apps. They periodically have karaoke nights, movie/tv nights and game nights. &#160;- &#160;- &#160;- &#160;- &#160;- &#160;- &#160;- &#160;-The next game night is coming up this Saturday 7/11/09 at 6pm. &#160;Bring your cards or board games and join the other drinkers holed up in the funky bar in the back. food's pretty damn good- kinda expensive for dinner i would go for lunch. but they deliver! which is so damn awesome! now when i have beer munchies or whatever i don't have to leave the house and my options extend beyond pizza which is always a good thing. the general tao's chicken was awesome, i would totally get it again, and i probably will :)
This week I've been doing my civic duty as a member of a jury at the King County Courthouse. I'm looking at Piroshki On 3rd as my reward for not shirking my duty, even though I'm missing the pay I'd get if I was working my normal job. The food is great and the staff is quick, courteous and generally a joy to do business with. I'm apparently not the only one with that opinion, because they seem to have a lot of regulars who have a nice rapport with the staff. &#160;Everything I've tried here is great: the cookies, the pastries stuffed with cream cheese and apricots, the borscht, the piroshki. And the things I've ordered tend to be more than I've expected. When I ordered a mocha, I got a the mocha and a shortbread cookie. When I ordered an omelet I got it plus fried potatoes, toast and fruit. It's hard to argue with that approach. I tried something else this time and am a fan. &#160;Kulich. &#160; It's a bread that little nuggets of chocolate in it. &#160;It looked big and Hummer-like, but it was much lighter than I thought. &#160; It's not flakey light, like a croissant, but it isn't dense like a bagel. &#160;Is it bad manners to dunk in your latte'? Needing snacks to kill time after work I decided to try this bakery. First, I tried the spinach piroshki and its delicious. Being a big carnivore, I need to get something with meat.. so I decided to try their beef and cheese, its wonderfully blend. The crew is friendly and funny! Entertaining as well..This place is worth the stop if you happen to be in seattle. I'm half-Russian, and though I grew up on borscht, pelmeni, and cabbage in many forms, my Baba wasn't much of a baker. In fact, I never even had a real piroshki made by a real Russian til this place opened by my office.I can attest to the authenticity of their soups, their entrees, and even their coffee (strong, strong, strong). All delicious and perfect for a rainy or cold day. (Or rainy/cold day, as days in Seattle are usually both.)But it's the piroshki that have my heart. They have an extensive choice of fillings, everything from the authentic (cabbage and beef, cabbage and mushroom, cabbage and potato etc.) to the eclectic (pizza, smoked salmon and cream cheese). They also do mini-piroshki, which you can pre-order. I brought an order of these to my family Thanksgiving dinner and they were a hit with the Russians, the Americans, and even the little kids and picky eaters.They also have a mouthwatering selection of Russian pastries (which, unfortunately, weren't part of my childhood either) and espresso, which always includes a free butter cookie.The women running the place are really nice, and the place is spotlessly clean. It is a little loud in there, not because people are noisily talking between shots of vodka, but because of the acoustics. I wouldn't recommend it if you need to duck out of the office to make a personal phone call, for example. This place is on par with the venerable and Anthony Bourdain-blessed Piroshki Piroshki in the Pike Place Market, but for different reasons. I like the dough at Piroshki Piroshki better, but Piroshki on 3rd beats them on fillings (no meat and cabbage combo at the latter, which is a travesty).So would I recommend it? In the language of my forebearers: da. We were staying next door at the Arctic Club Hotel for our honeymoon and when we got up in the morning to walk to the Pike Street Market we were drawn into this yummy surprise of a place. &#160;I wasn't in an adventurous mood that morning &amp; didn't order anything. &#160;Thankfully, my husband ordered 2. &#160;He ordered a beef &amp; cheese and a beef &amp; onion. &#160;I ended up eating half of the beef &amp; onion! &#160;It was so good! &#160;He had to give his up after I tasted it! &#160;The beef and cheese was a bit bland. I've only had the piroshkis and the sweets here, and always to-go. Sometimes I'll grab a couple piroshkis on the way home from work, and add a salad when I get home. Dinner is served!But my vice here is the sweets, especially since about 5 months into my pregnancy. What I love is that these aren't the knock-you-out &#160;with sugar type of confection that you might find in a standard dessert case. They're *appropriately* sweet, which lets the other flavors shine. Yummy shortbreads, including poppyseed shortbread, plus poppyseed rolls, vatrushka (ricotta &amp; jam pastries), and a mouthwatering assortment of cakes! Today alone I've had the bavarian cherry cake (which seems to be composed of stacks of pastry-wrapped ricotta and tart cherries), and chocolate waffle cake (layers of stacked waffles with cream, topped off with chocolate). They were supposed to be dessert tonight, but I had to send a sheepish text to my husband warning him that there *may* be a few chunks missing by the time he sees them. What?!? I'm pregnant here! OMG....you must try the pelmeni soup. I ordered it to go and the lady said 10 mins. &#160;I was OK with that thinking that they must be making a fresh batch. &#160;I ended up with 2 bowls as they didn't have a to go bowl big enough to hold the whole dish. &#160;The chicken dumplings are wonderful and the broth is divine! &#160;Next time I will split it with someone else as a half order was enough to fill me up.Go now and get the soup! You won't be sorry. I wish I knew her name...The sweet lady that greets me each morning when I am craving a bite to eat or some soup to battle the cold. She speaks in a think Russian accent and plays my heart strings with all of the delicious choices. They serve espresso, a plethora of different baked goods (primarily piroshkis) and a number of daily soups. Most of what they serve from what I can tell is Russian food all of which is damn good. The soups are surprisingly filling and they don't hold back on the meat in anything they serve which I love. I think an ideal date walking about the city in the mid morning would involve a stop here. Although it is a little ways away from the heart of the shopping district downtown it is definitely well worth the walk and would readily recommend this place to anyone. Only gripes: a tiny bit pricey and the location makes it really easy to walk by without realizing it is there. I'm still a fan yay however, I received very RUDE service the other day. Be weary of the staff, they may give you 'tude if you don't know what you want to order the minute you walk in the door.And after my piroshki was heated, it literally burned the roof of my mouth. I can't have things like this happening. I'm going to go on a three-week piroshki strike.See you in June. Oh Piroshki on 3rd, if I could write you a love letter I would. We loved Piroshki on 3rd so much that we went twice in 5 days. The piroshki is delicious. If you could imagine everything good wrapped up into pastry dough that would be Piroshki on 3rd. My favorites were the bavarian sausage and the salmon w/ cream cheese. My fiance got the ham, cheese, and bacon one day (which he loved). The second time he got turkey and cheese which he didn't like as much as the first one but he said it was still good. Piroshki is the perfect thing to warm you up on a cold Seattle morning. In addition, they have delicious coffee and they give you a cinnamon sugar cookie (not a snickerdoodle, it's harder in texture) when you order coffee there. They have desserts also but we did not get to try any although they looked just as amazing as the piroshki. On top of the delicious food and coffee the lady behind the counter is very nice and helpful. We would definitely become regulars here if we lived in the city. the best kept secret here is the:a) fruit salad bowlsb) soup selections (borscht and otherwise)c) their "white rolls" - $0.25 each and the same sweet bread as the piroshkis.....heaven!!The ladies work really hard but they could be a liiiiiittle bit more friendly sometimes. Their piroshki is very tasty (and for reasonable prices). I work next door and go to this place for tea every day with co-workers. The lady who makes drinks for us is very nice and friendly. We usually get their shortbread cookies as well, which are super yummy too! Authentic Russian style bakery with a breakfast and lunch menu. I had the Russian Country Style breakfast which is essentially a Russian style omlette. Very fresh ingredients prepared with spinach, mushrooms, potatoes, cheese and a dollop of fresh sour cream. Very good. I also sampled a piroshki which was also fresh and very tasty. Great spot. I tried a flaky cherry and walnut strudel one evening. I grabbed it in my hands and took it to go. It was good. Oh dear... I may have made a mistake by going to Po3 for the first time today. I got the smoked salmon cream cheese piroshky. It's a heavenly pillow of delicate pastry filled generously with a flavorful blend of smoked salmon and cream cheese. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other pastries and dishes on the menu. If you love russian pastries this is the place to come...love this place.. No joke, It's worth the 5 stars just for the Borsch (beet soup) alone!! Ok, for real though. The Piroshki are hot, big and bloody gorgeous. Each bite is better than the last and I always want to cry when I've eaten it all up and they're gone. I wish they were a tad cheaper but then I would probably hurt myself from eating too much. Coming from a family from Russia and growing up eating Piroshki's, this place is definitely legit. &#160;If you are downtown/Pioneer Square and need a snack, grab yourself a beef and cabbage piroshki and a cup of borscht. &#160;You're set for the rest of the day. Great piroshki - salmon beef corn mushroom - they are all quite lovely for a morning/mid day meal on a cold day. &#160;The cherry butter crust is tasty, but its engineering ensures you will end up wearing flakes, powered sugar, or pie filling. Wow, stuffed pastries are the Bomb!
Just a quick review, this is some of the best Teriyaki I've had. What makes it great you ask? Well, for starters, they leave the skin on the chicken and cook it to perfection. The rice is always done well and the salad served on the side has a great dressing. I've also had their tempura shrimp which is light and fluffy served with a great dipping sauce. The people here are incredible too. It seems to be a mother and daughter team that runs the place and a couple of guys in the kitchen who have been there a long time. One thing to note, if you are religious-averse, you may want to go elsewhere. There is scripture and verse papered all over the walls and they provide free bibles if you're interested in. Though not a fan of religion myself, they don't force you to take a bible or anything. I have seen the mother pray with certain people in the foyer though. All in all, get your dose of yummy goodness and Jesus all in one bite! :-) Enjoy! I have worked in the area for the last 6 years and have frequented Toshio's probably 20+ times and today i decided to go in there cause just like everyone else says, the meat is so tender and the sauce is amazing! &#160;You ask why the 2 star? Its not cause of the taste its cause of the portions. &#160;Not only was it me that got but maybe 10 pieces of teriyaki chicken, everyone around me got that amount. &#160;In the past, easily you would get 20 pieces and almost have enough for a little snack later. &#160;I paid $8.25 for chicken teriyaki and regular softdrink, for that price and the small amount of portions, you could easily go elsewhere and get food comparable and a lil bigger portions. &#160;I dont know if its cause of the economy or what but unless people start posting that they are back to giving out nice sized portions i will be going elsewhere for my teriyaki fix. In some weird vortex of time, distance, and maybe space, Toshio's is literally the ONLY place in walking distance of my house. &#160;The very northern tip of Beacon Hill is definitely not very neighborhoody in that regard. &#160;So, when Toshio's appeared to close (egads, the horror!) and it appeared I'd have to drive whenever the need for food prepared by someone other than me became necessary, I was sad. &#160;They were only 5 blocks away! &#160;Beef jerky is NOT food!Whew. &#160;They've only temporarily relocated. &#160;Okay, cool. &#160;Breathing again.To be honest, I'm not sure how much of my good will towards this place is because of their sole status as star of my walking food joints or because I actually like the place. &#160;Sometimes I think my mind tricks into liking something just because of its convenience. (Realizing that helped me kick the Starbucks habit! Oh, and my new place doesn't require jaywalking in a neighborhood where my car has been hit 3 times and I know of at least 4 people being hit themselves...) &#160;The food is fine; it's teriyaki, and teriyaki has never been a favorite of mine. &#160;Toshio's teriyaki tastes like most teriyaki I've had, so yeah. &#160;It is what it is, and what it is is teriyaki.Convenient teriyaki with friendly, polite people serving it up. &#160;Cool. This place just re opened after fire for 6 months and they are super good food and affordable. I eat here all the time. Order the regular teriyaki, skinless with sauce on the rice. &#160;Best in town. I absolutely love this place! Their teriyaki sauce is the best and the salad dressing is probably to this day my favorite! The food portion is still quite large with recession proof pricing! Best bet: Chicken and Short Rib combo Teriyaki at Toshio's is as good as teriyaki gets!!! I have gone to many teriyaki joints but this is by far one of the greatest!Toshio's uses all white meat chicken breast that is juicy and tender! Every bite of chicken is covered in the yummiest teriyaki sauce, that is equally sweet and soy saucy!Each chicken teriyaki dish comes with two scoops of rice and a salad. YUM YUM YUM!!!I love toshio's and I think Im gonna go right now! :) So far, I think Toshio's has the best teriyaki. Unlike other teriyaki places, Toshio's leave the skin on the chicken making the whole eating experience super orgasmic. Haha. I don't normally like consuming slimy skin from chicken... but couldn't hold back from Toshio's chicken. Their chicken is super tender (compared to the other places I've been to) and their salad dressing is the best! But the reason why I didn't give a them 5 stars is because their portions have shrunk a bit... maybe it's related to the recession, but I was still satisfied!Keep in mind that they have a temporary location right now and that is next to the Shell gas station on Rainier Ave. It's pretty close to its original location. One thing I didn't really notice from all the times I went there before was that the owners are super religious. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with that, but I just never noticed it before. They have Christian music playing in the background and have religious postings on the walls. The owners are friendly. I got my order within five minutes.Good place to go for some quick, well-priced, great quality teriyaki. Good Yaki, bad salad. &#160;But who gets yaki for the salad? &#160;I suggest calling in and taking it to go. good people. &#160;good food. &#160;been a customer for 5 years. &#160;teriiyaki chicken is the signiture dish. &#160;but try their chicken curry. &#160;dont forget the hot sauce... When I don't know what to eat Toshios always comes to mind. &#160;It's simple, yummy, quick, and cheap! &#160;Their chicken teriyaki is good considering the fact that they are fast food! &#160;The chicken is tender and juicy (not dry and overcooked, as one would assume from a fast food place). &#160;The owner lady and I believe her daugther are a wonderful team...they are always so sweet and nice.This place is really one of those hole in the wall places, but they are very good! &#160;I've been going here since ever since I was little and they have never failed me! &#160;Since it is very cramped and busy most of the time I usually get take out. &#160;Highly recommend this place if you're looking a for a quick and cheap eat for lunch..or even dinner =) They do a darned good Teriyaki, they humor their customers culinary quirks, and seem like pretty good people.Yes, they are overtly religious. No, I'm not silly enough to write a place off because of a bit of evangelicalism. &#160;They are close to my work, they do good food, and they are not the "evil-hateful-fundie" kind of Christian as far as I can tell. It's their place, so its their right to build out the decor and messages they want &#160;*shrug*.And they are back in the original location!! Pretty standard dive teriyaki joint. &#160;It's small inside, but there are benches outside. &#160;Very fast and friendly--I thought the teriyaki sauce was a tad too sweet...but if you throw enough hot sauce on top you can't really tell. &#160;It's a good amount of food for a pretty decent price.
Seattle is not Los Angeles. Seattle does not have Mexican food which you could shoot yourself in the foot over. However, there are Americanized restaurants which do a superb job while supplying good food quickly, and at affordable prices. This is one of those places. When I came here last, it was the Magnolia mommy and daddy rush, and despite three kids spilling their sodas, two birthday parties, and general dinner time rush, my food came out so quickly it was scary. Prices- I think that theyre pretty average for a sit down place. My dish was about 11 bucks, (DISCLAIMER: yeah, a little spendy, but Im also a college student, and anything more than 8 bucks is spendy in my book right now), but when you think about the average price per dish in most restaurants, thats not above average. Total price for 2 sodas, appetizer, and two entree's was about 35 bucks. With leftovers.A good place to bring most people- theres things for adults, kids, picky eaters, and last I checked, theres a sizable vegetarian menu...
I do not get all the Bell Thai hate. I'm really surprised people have had bad experiences, because I have always had great service here. Brian knows me by name, and learned my boyfriend's name after one visit! He always greets me with a smile, asks how Ray is doing, and jokes around about my order (I'm not a fan of bean sprouts, so he sometimes jokes "extra sprouts for you tonight!")The food's nothing miraculous, but they tolerate special instructions and ask for your spiciness preference. I've tried the Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, and the Cashew (I think) chicken and they were all pretty good. Not the greatest Thai food in Seattle, but I keep coming back for the service. I may be bias, because after one visit, Brian had already learned my name. And I'm not even the one who lives in Seattle; I was visiting my boyfriend. But the second time I came in to pick up some food, I was greeted with a "Hi, Ray!"The pad thai is absolutely fine. Not incredible and definitely not bad. Based on the dish alone, I'd probably give it three stars. Also, maybe it was a lunch special or something, but I received a spring roll and some soup with my pad thai when I came in. My boyfriend has yet to receive the same. Must have been a lunch thing. (Or I'm just awesome).If I lived near the place, I'd probably make it habit to come here. Decent food, convenient... and you already know I'm a fan of the service. Sorry to those with bad experiences - my boyfriend and I have been treated pretty well so far. This place is ok. It's clean and the decor is nice. I enjoyed the green curry. The pad thai and pad see ew were decent. I wasn't very happy about the Thai BBQ chicken. The lady told us there are six pieces of chicken. The dish came and there were only 4 pieces. They weren't prepared like other Thai BBQ chicken I've tried anywhere else. Just plain blah tasteless BBQ chicken. We were pretty full when the dish came so we let that go. What I really dislike was that the bill came with just a total. I did the math in my head...we ordered 6 dishes and they are about $10 each. I had to ask the lady and she told us tips were included and taxes were 20%. Nice to know, otherwise I would've double-tipped them. I wish we hadn't come here. For appetizers we got the crab won-tons and prawn cakes, and for the main course we got the ka nom jean green curry and one of the standard Thai noodle dishes (don't remember which). I don't know why I bother ordering crab won-tons anymore, they are always a let-down: 90% cream cheese and 10% crab. Additionally, my g/f thinks it was imitation crab. The prawn cakes were very bland and did not taste of prawn at all--almost certainly pre-made and frozen. The green curry was pretty tasteless other than for the spiciness, and the combination of rice noodles and green curry really did not work very well. The other noodle dish we got was actually decent, but nothing more than we could get at numerous other Thai restaurants. Strangely, the green curry was at least twice as spicy as the noodle dish, yet we had ordered both as 2-star.To make matters worse, the meal gave both of us gas for several hours! I have never gotten gas from Thai food before, which makes me wonder if perhaps one of our dishes was made with old or expired ingredients. Just came back from Bell Thai. Found a dead mosquito on bottom of the plate. I've almost finished with the plate. The waiter &#160;did offer me another dish to go, but I declined. Will never be there again. Great Food and Service. Easy location to stop in for Lunch, Never too Busy! Wandering Day Friday Yay... began at Central Library and ended up here. The avocado green curry special sounded nice and the waiter said it was popular. Okie. I'll try that. The complimentary soup was simple and light. The curry was good. Might've been a touch hotter than the 1 star I wanted (1.4, 1.5 maybe?). The cute waitress had a nice scent about her. Service was okay. The large B&amp;W printed message under the glass table is rather tacky... I mean, you sit down and BAM, it's right there in your face... o.O Food is decent for a quick lunch, but I have found many other Thai places I enjoy more. &#160;The service is alright, but not the friendliest. &#160;They take plastic but charge extra for anything under $10.... Bring cash, or order a lot? Hm... i tend to resent that, but that's just me. &#160;They didn't make my food spicy enough and I just find that they don't really pay enough attention to details... *sigh* Too expensive for what u get. &#160;4 pieces of thai bbq chicken that consisted of a wing, 1/4 breast, thigh, drumstick for $10. &#160;Chix looked like they just pan fried it to brown it. &#160;Never had Thai BBQ like that before! &#160;Terrible! Green curry was the only thing that tasted good, but again...mainly sauce. &#160;Thai fried rice..not even fried! &#160;Looked like they tossed stir fried veggies into white rice and drizzled oil over it. &#160;Worst meal of our 7 day trip to Seattle. 6 dishes..mainly with chicken cost us $85..no drinks!!!! &#160;Spend you money elsewhere. The man that always seems to be working is rude, the delivery time is aweful too! Frequently takes over an hour. Enough said... Food is alright. Would rather eat thai food somewhere else in Seattle. On our last night in Seattle my friend and I decided to try this restaurant because it was near our hotel. I had the pad thai with chicken and she had the sweet and sour chicken with cucmbers. The pad thai was good. It had a good flavor but was kind of dry. The sweet and sour chicken was really light and really good. I would recommend this place if you are in the area!
How hard can it be to find a truly excellent pizza place outside of N.Y. or Chicago? &#160;You'd think putting together a great pizza wouldn't rival finding the Ark of the Covenant, but maybe it does. Conventional wisdom says that a good independent place should beat out most chains, but remarkably, that is not often the case. Fresh toppings, an abundance of gooey cheese, and a generous layer of zesty sauce are fundamentals that so many places fail to get right. So for that reason, I'd actually put up the increasingly more scarce Round Table up against ANY other national chain, along with the large majority of local chains and independents. So I guess I have a "Round Table standard." These days, most places fail to meet it. Only a small handful of places actually exceed it...So it came as no surprise that Zeek's failed to meet my "Round Table standard," but in "failing," they simply join the vast landscape of solidly B-/C+ pizza places out there. While pepperoni is clearly the national topping of choice, I'm an all-in "works" kind of guy. So, we ordered their "Kitchen Sink," a pizza with all the toppings you'd think of on a supreme (sausage, pepperoni, green peppers, onions, olives, etc.), and some extras like bacon bits, Canadian bacon, garlic, and chunks of chicken. Here's the pizza breakdown:PROS-The toppings were generous, and for the most part, tasty. &#160;-The crust was pretty good--a nice bite of soft buttery chew without being TOO chewy, dry, or doughy. &#160;-Their pizza selection is fairly diverse, so there should be something that fits everyone's palate.CONS-The biggest problem is not an uncommon one at most places: not enough sauce. I'd also say the sauce was bland and unassertive, but there was barely enough of it to moisten the dough, let alone enough to make a fair assessment.-The chunks of herbed chicken included on their "Kitchen Sink" reminded me of those overly-tender, over-herbed, pre-frozen chicken chunks you can get in bulk at Costco. The chicken actually detracted from an otherwise decent group of toppings. -More cheese please.As far as the other stuff, the breadsticks were good, which makes sense since their crust is also a relative strong point. Their salads were decent, but the Caesar bordered on the bland (if you have to consider sprinkling salt on your Caesar salad, something's not right). Our server was personable, friendly, and attentive, so no complaints there. Like many places, Zeke's isn't worth a special trip. Yet if you're in the area, need a compromise choice for a group, or have no superb "go to" pizza place, you could do a lot worse than Zeek's. I personally believe that it is tricky to judge pizzas - there are just too many types and too many personal preferences. To me, Zeeks is a place that I go to for convenience, not a place that I go for my favorite type of pizza. Whenever I am craving a greasy slice of pizza, I walk across the street on my lunch break for a single slice. For people that work in the area, their lunch slices are a quick, cheap ($4.00) option. I usually stick to something simple - cheese or pepperoni are always safe - but the Puget Pounder is also good. If you are not a fan of a lot of dough, this is probably not the place for you. One thing that I really appreciate about Zeeks is the staff. They have always been very polite to me and they seem to be attentive and clean, which are all pluses in my book! Well, this place was OK. I ordered a small pepperoni with extra sauce ... it was $16. That is way too pricey for what I got! I really was not too impressed with the pizza. The crust was good, but I felt the sauce was a bit lacking in the zest department. Other than that, service was good ... prices a bit high. One of the worst pizzas I have ever tried but the Parmesan sticks were OK.I definitely don't recommend this place. Zeeks didn't live up to the hype for me.My boyfriend and I ordered a Yeti pizza for pickup on the way home from a weekend away. The employee told us it'd be ready in "10 to 20" after the phone call -- perfect timing for our short detour there.I hopped out of the car, planning to pick it up and run back out before we'd need to find a real parking spot. However, when I arrived about 18 minutes into counting, and paid, I was told our pizza would be out shortly. 10 minutes later still, it was carried to me, at least with an apology for the delay.The pizza itself was good, but not great. And for a medium, we definitely had no leftovers...not unexpected, but for $22 with tax, not a bargain. Love Zeeks. &#160;I order from them every other week for our company lunches. &#160;Huge variety and they never disappoint. &#160;Their pizzas are amazing.I had a coupon from them for a free slice of pizza, 1/2 salad and drink. &#160;I had in my mind that all of these would be small but they were GIGANTIC! &#160;The "slice" of pizza was easily two huge slices and the 1/2 salad was enormous- it took up an entire plate. &#160;There was nothing 1/2 about it. &#160;The John Candy is a favorite. &#160;It's packed with meats (pepperoni, Canadian bacon and &#160;sausage) and so so good. &#160;They don't skimp on anything.The man who took my order was very friendly and even came by and refilled my lemonade! &#160;How nice is that? Pizzas here have a fairly thick doughy crusts and are heavily loaded with toppings.The Chicken Club is quite nice but sometimes requires a fork from the sheer amount of toppings on it.It should also be noted that their delivery and pick-up is top notch. Best thing about Zeeks is the crust. I don't know what their secret is, but it's always cooked to perfection. The pizza as a whole is delicious but man, the price is a tad on the steep side if you're on a budget. I spent 35 bucks on a medium pizza and chopped salad (which was delicious); just enough for two people. Delivery was fast and the staff is really friendly. Not bad. The service is good. I haven't had great pizza on the West Coast but this is the best so far. Good location, good pizza, the manager was nice enough to throw a pizza dough ball out to the little one at our table. &#160;Very accommodating. &#160;Service is a little slow, but otherwise good food for what you pay. &#160;The pizza topping combos always make me so happy!
Wow, really? I've been wanting to come here for months, and I never realized it's in the same complex I shop at EVERY weekend? Such utter fail. But! After much adieu, I finally made it here for lunch the other day, accompanied by Rebecca S. For those who have a bit of trouble finding it, it's actually up on the second floor, which is probably why I've never noticed it all this time.We ordered far more than we were able to eat, but hey, I'm always a fan of leftovers:* The meal started off with a complimentary cold kimchi-like dish - I'm not quite sure if it was (cabbage and shit, according to Rebecca), but it was spicy and pretty tasty. * The dan dan noodles were also incredibly good, strong and spicy, with noodles of good consistency and texture. Finding a good balance of noodles to sauce was important though, because I found that it could easily either be too bland or too salty. The leftover sauce was pretty good with rice too, should anyone care to try.* Egg drop soup was also really good, though I found it a bit unusual for having young bamboo shoots and shiitake in it - this was in no way a bad thing though. I ended up taking the leftovers home and making a pretty tasty congee with it, by just adding rice and some white pepper.* Can't really comment on the tofu since I didn't eat much of it, but it was reminiscent of that common cold dish with long slivers of tofu with celery and carrots.The place was pretty clean (although I heard the restroom was typical Chinese restaurant fare), and service was, well, a bit more than expected, as our waitress actually served and split the noodles and soup for us. Price was pretty good, with all that coming out to be ~$25, leaving enough for at least another two meals worth of food (three if you get a bit creative). Now that I know where this is, I'm definitely coming here instead of Sichuanese when I get the munchies before doing my groceries. After being unable to attend the UYE at Shabu Shabu Paradise, I was craving some shabu shabu. &#160;After some research, Chinese hot pot was about the closest to shabu shabu I could find in Seattle. &#160;I had been here several years before and remember it was pretty good, so I thought I would come here again.I ordered the hot pot and the green onion pancake (based on another Yelper's review). &#160;The hot pot was fine. &#160;You can choose from different broths or even go half and half. &#160;As for the actual ingredients, you are really only choosing the types of meat. &#160;You can opt for the mix plate (chicken, beef, pork, fatty lamb), all beef and lamb, or seafood. &#160;The rest of the ingredients (bamboo, tofu, potato, napa cabbage, tripe, glass noodles, wood ear fungus) are all standard and I think refillable for free. &#160;There are some extra a la carte items such as mushrooms, fish cakes, etc. &#160;The clear broth was similar to a very dilute vegetable stock, which was fine, I can't tolerate the spicy broth. &#160;My only complaints with the hot pot are: the meat was sliced too thick and the meat was too fatty for my taste. &#160;The green onion pancake was good. &#160;crispy outside, soft middle, not a whole lot of onions though. &#160;The best part of that was the chili-soy dipping sauce.Although the food was good, I don't remember the service ever being this bad. &#160;The waitstaff was so lazy! &#160;When the food for my hot pot arrived, I assumed they would bring me a bowl, a spoon, a laddle, a ingredients to make a sauce. &#160;Nope. &#160;I had to go ask for them for each of the items. &#160;One time, the waitress wouldn't believe me! &#160;She came to the table to look to see if I was lying about not getting certain utensils! &#160;Then to top it all of, she brings me my check without me asking as if there were a long line of customers waiting to get in! &#160;Sheesh! &#160;I probably won't going back until I am really craving hot pot and I have forgotten about the horrible service. This is the best Chinese restaurant I've ever been in in Seattle! The people are super friendly and for once the waiters actually seem like they want to be there (love mom and pop run joints!). We ordered family style and got the full treatment of soup, rice, salad-style pasta, fish, meat, vegetables! I felt like a kid at a candy store! To feed seven of us it only costed only about $60! Location is great, nestled in the heart of downtown on the second floor of a plaza so you can easily and readily take care of your international district shopping in one trip. There's plenty of free parking in the garage downstairs (unlike most of international district) and it is nicely furnished with a lot of contemporary and Asian aesthetics! I can't find anything I didn't like about this place. I absolutely LOVE hot pot. My parents would make it about once a week duing the winter when it's freezing cold outside. It's the perfect remedy to warm yourself up! So when it comes down to finding new places that serves hot pot, I'm all for it. Came here last night to try their hot pot for the first time and the first thing I had noticed was almost every other table was having hot pot. It made all of their windows steamy. haha.. The service was pretty quick.. we ordered the #1 selection which is the regular hot pot with pork, chicken, beef, and lamb. We also ordered a side of green onion pancake which was delish that came with a garlicky spicy sauce (which ended up being my hot pot dipping sauce). First plate we got was the black fungus with sliced daikon to put in our half spicy/half non-spicy broth that we had chosen. Then our waiter brought the other plates - tofu, bamboo shoots, vermicelli noodles, udon noodles, napa cabbage, and our sliced meats (pork, chicken, beef, and lamb). Our table was full of food with the pot in the middle. We also got a big heaping bowl of their special peanut garlic sauce specifically for dipping but we requested for more of the (green onion pancake) sauce so I can use instead, I was okay on the peanut sauce.. the waiter had no problem and brought me more. *yay*Everything tasted really good. I was pleasantly surprised about the sliced chicken. Normally it can get really dry especially putting it in the boiling broth but it came out perfectly tender. My favorite is always the lamb though, nothing beats lamb. I also liked the udon noodles which in my opinion tasted better than the vermicelli. I will definitely come back again, I like how the restaurant is bigger than other places I've gone to so then it doesn't feel so crowded. Oh yeah, and their spicy broth is really good but the heat definitely builds up. We didn't mind at all but I definitely drank more water than I usually do when eating.. **3.5 stars**It's spicy and oily, and oh so good...every once in awhile. My only gripe is the location. I absolutely hate this complex. More specifically, I hate the parking garage. The spots are tight and the people are just bloody awful at parking. Our group of 3 ordered 3 entree dishes (we had much more food than we needed). Szechuan fish - fillets of fish/bamboo shoots/cabbage swimming in a broth of fire. Dried chilies. Chili oil. Chili this. Chili that. Once the dish cooled down however, it wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be. It was quite tasty actually. Garlic crispy chicken - a bit americanized, but the spices are great. It's sweet, spicy and a little tangy. Beef noodle soup with hand shaven noodle: unlike other places, these noodles are really thick. The broth was flavorful but it felt like there wasn't enough of it. And oh. The meat. Not that great. It's the same meat they use in hot pot. Thinly sliced. Overcooked. Rubbery. If you want to try hand shaven noodle, it's probably best to get it stir fried. We also tried to order the tea smoked duck (which is well known in szeuchuan cuisine) but they were sold out by 6:30PM. Must be really good! Big flavor and a nice selection of dishes, from mild to spicy, &#160;the spice-challenged need to watch out! &#160;4 star was a true 4 star rating, I was in heaven....ahhh.....Monthly dinner party decided to tackle this place. &#160;Food came out at an amazing pace, granted there we only about 3-4 other tables. &#160;Our party of 9 were served well and they even split the bill for us.Dan-dan noodles were a delight, I could live on those bad-boys for the rest of my life....well maybe not that long, but you get the picture, big favor and those wonderful handmade noodles....drool....Parking lot under the restaurant is a major bonus, the hours are a bit weird as half of the lot closes down in the evenings. &#160;The person running the garage was nice enough to track down one of our party members to have him move his car. &#160;It's tight fit in there so be careful.I'll have to come back again, if it's still good, I'll bump it up a star. I came here for Chinese food once- way too greasy for my stomach. My experience was redeemed yesterday with the hotpot. They have two types of broth- regular and spicy. There were 7 of us and we ordered 5 servings of the family hot pot and it was a lot of food and too much tripe. Make sure you don't order one serving per person. If you are into it, they have that crazy brown "must be cracked inside" because it so addicting soy bean sauce. This is a review for their takeout because we got there late and decided it was better to take it home rather than being the last ones there.Anyhow, the wanton soup wasn't that great but the pork in garlic sauce was not only generous in portion but very delicious. I will definitely go back and try their hotpot and other items. Anyway, looks good, will try it again and upgrade my rating accordingly! Love Szechuan... love the heat.So many good reviews so I had to try it.If I haven't tried Szechuan First in Kent first I would have given them 4 stars but now I can only give 3.I had the Szechuan beef. It was dry and chewy. I need to try the hotpot next time. It might be better. Only ordered their special hand shaven noodles and a pancake, and while they tasted good, they weren't that great. Meh. I guess I'll try other Chinese restaurants. Do you want to visit a delicious and CHEAP Chinese restaurant?This is a great choice!! I recently went here with a huge group of Yelpers. We ordered a bunch of food, and... everyone ended up only paying $11!!!! Omg, wow! AMAZING!I enjoyed some dishes more than other dishes, but it sure was filling! I believe my favorites were the hand shaven dan dan noodles and the pepper fish. The smoked duck was just not for me. The seafood hot pot was pretty craaazy and pretty tasty.Not a big fan of the bathrooms, but the food is cheap and good! I like it. For the longest time I thought the restaurant was called Schezuan Peppers. &#160;Lol! &#160;We referred to yelp reviews to help narrow down the menu. &#160;It took about 15 minutes to decide what to order and it took less than 10 minutes to get our food! What?! Ok. &#160;Schezuan Dan Dan hand shaven noodles with pork - so flavorful, the noodles where bite sized and the texture was similar to mushrooms.Steam dumpling - loved the dumpling wrapper - it's not the usual wonton wrapper.Schezuan chicken - all I can say is that my breath was kicking all night. &#160;The dish had loads of garlic, white onions, and green onion.Later that night, my stomach was so upset w/ me...I would definitely come again, maybe for hot pot. I ate family style. Tryed so much dishes and I can't remember all the names. I know I ate tofu and I liked it. I didn't like there fried duck. It was too dry and it didn't have much meat.  I never went to that kind if restaurant before, so it wad interesting to see how they boil food in pot and then eat. Basically they give you raw food and you cook it, but it's not everything raw so don't worry. You don't have to cook everything. I ate lots of spiciness in that restaurant. That was HOT :)I would come over there again to taste more food. I have been here twice, ordered different things each time, and have been impressed with the results. I'm a spicy-food aficionado and this place offers just the right amount of spice. BF loves fried chicken and this is definitely a great place for some Szechuan-style fried chicken.The Pork and Preserved Cabbage soup was delicious. Crispy-pickley pieces of shredded cabbage and tender pieces of pork in a fatty, delicious broth. It is a simple soup with great flavors. A little sour, savory, and salty really hits the spot.We also had the hot and sour soup one time -- standard Americanized-Chinese food fare. Nothing worth saying much about. The Szechuan Spicy Fried Chicken was great. Bit size chunks of meat, deep fried, perfectly salted, with just the right amount of heat (which is probably a lot of heat, for those not used to szechuan chilis). It's one of those addictive foods that you can't put down because it tastes so good, yet you need a breather every now and then because the chilis are burning your tongue. Pain with the pleasure makes the pleasure even better. We ordered a different chicken dish the second time we came, but I don't recall which one it was. It was good and I remembered thinking that Seven Stars prepares chicken really well, and that's all I need to remember.Dan Dan noodles here are delicious. They are thick, chewy, shaved noodles in a peanut broth with green onion and peanuts. Spicy, of course, but only mildly. It is a hearty dish and I left so satisfied after eating these noodles. We have had another noodle dish here, with thin noodles, but I don't remember what they were called and I wasn't blown away. We also had the dry-fried green beans. Its the usual wok-fried green beans, Szechuan style. It's standard fare, but it's also delicious. The green beans were the perfect texture -- skin slightly blistered from the oil, yet it was still crunchy. The chili heat didn't distract from the fragrance of the other flavors (mostly garlic, but also some other things that I don't remember)To top it off, service was also great and the prices are more than reasonable. This is definitely my go-to Szechuan restaurant. Came here for Jennifer's UYE. &#160;She pushed it back to 7pm and i had to attend the mariners game after. &#160;My stomach made the decision to attend. &#160;I walk into the restaurant and I notice 2 tables of yelpers.Greet Alvin with his welcoming smile. Bruddah Jon kicking back. Motorcycle Daren on the corner, The mad Russian Vitaly, Big Rich fashionably late and the rest of the fellow yelpers. Said hello to Jennifer and sat on her table. Right next to Eric. Buddy Jorge was chatting away with Nerick. Big Johnny B comes rolling in. Sits to joyful Inna and the rest of the yelper clan.Leave the ordering to the host. Suggest some favorites I like. Seafood hot pot. Noodles. She ordered 4 dishes. Fish, chicken, pork, all with red chili peppers. A medium kick jennifer says. As we all chatted before dinner. Snapping pictures. The girls talking about high school. The food finally arrives. A quite hush covers the table as everyones eyes are feasting on the on coming dishes. One by one they arrive. Filtering on everyones plate. All you hear is ohhs and ahhhs. Slurping and chomping. I guess with no conversation the food was hitting it's spot. &#160;As the plates were being licked by Nerick I notice Jenn. reaching below the table. She starts to pass out her fresh baked yelper peanut butter cookies. Ohhh what a fine dessert it was. And she game me 2 bags for my friends at the Mariner game.I had to leave in an hour as the check arrived. Jennifer does her magical calculation and she says $11/ W tip. I could have kissed her right there. Awesome....Good Food, Good People, = a Great time.!!!Jenn's UYE have been running since MARCH. It's the best food event during that week. Don't you ever miss one....I definitely won't !! My mom went to China a few years ago and told me stories of hot pot and how good it was. There are hot pot places around and although her enthusiasm made me want to go I never visited any location. So imagine my delight with I got the chance to try it. I met some fellow Yelpers here (what up, y'all?) on New Year's Day. I arrived to find a packed restaurant mainly of big families with lots of kids. Oh boy. I found a table (it had a lazy Susan!) and made myself comfortable. A waiter soon came with menus and water. This may seem silly but I love restaurants that have lazy Susans. Call me childish but I like spinning my food around and I may even like to pretend I'm spinning a record. I can't confirm nor deny that. As I looked over the menu there were other dishes as well which surprised me since I figured you only ordered raw meat and vegetables. Soon everyone arrived and we left the ordering to the top pot veteran. A waitress came by and dropped off this black contraption. I looked around it. It had a place for a bowl and what looked like a propane can. Interesting. Plates and plates of food started to appear. Raw meat, fish, tofu, vegetables, sauces, noodles. There almost wasn't enough room on the table. The water in the pot was boiling and we started to throw things in. I took delight in dropping food in and taking it out. I liked this participatory dinner. My food was thrown together and I added a little sauce since I was warned it was spicy as all heck. I did use a lot of hoisin sauce. I wasn't super impressed but it was tolerable. To my surprise every plate was clean once we were done. A word of caution: make sure you keep track of how long each item has been in the pot. All of us suffered some digestive issues later that night. I got off easy with some gas but others weren't as lucky. The issue was things were thrown in and little attention was paid therefore it was likely we had some undercooked food. Our fault. Just make sure not to make the same mistakes we did. It'll save your stomach and asshole a lot of discomfort.I found Seven Stars to be subpar. If I could I would give it two and a half stars. While I loved making my food, if you will, I didn't find it to be all that flavorful. Maybe I didn't use enough sauce? If I decide to give Seven Stars another chance I will make sure to cook my food thoroughly and douse it in every sauce. My first UYE event! Thanks Jennifer L. for picking this place out. I have been to several Szechuan restaurants including Sichuanese Cuisine down the street and Spicy Talk in Redmond which is where the original owner of Seven Stars Pepper now has a place. And Seven Stars Pepper rates fairly favorably.At my table, I was joined alongside by Alvin N. and Christine Y. as well met some Yelpers, Vitaliy P. and his brother, Richard U and Darren D. I think these events are lot more preferable to the Elite Events which can be be bit whirlwind.The decor of the place is a bit odd. It is in a strip mall on Jackson. It kind of feels like you are dining in someone's apartment especially when you look outside the window and watch the hustle and bustle.Our humble table of 7 had a huge feast. We got hand shaven dan dan noodles, chopped pepper fish (the fried kind), green onion pancakes, crispy duck, mapo tofu and a hot pot for four. The size of dishes are fairly large, so this actually probably could have fed two more people.The hand shaven noodles were nice. The sauce in noodles also goes well with some rice I noticed. The mapo tofu was pretty good. Kind of saltier than I expected. Although I have to admit that I like mapo tofu with ketchup as an ingredient, so cue the skepticism on that.The green onion pancakes and crispy duck taste like I expected. I have these had these items before and they were kind of ordinary, but alright. Did not have much of the hot pot, but I liked the broth which was a bit spicy. Egg noodles and stew would go well with this broth. But the best dish of all was the chopped pepper fish. It is kind of how fried fish should be served if on a platter. Total damage of the meal was $113+ plus tip which is pretty good given the portions.I liked some of the dishes better than others, so it is kind of more of a 3.5 stars place for me. But the service was really good and I liked that the waitress was constantly tending to our table. Throwing water into the hot pot ever so often. Seven Stars Pepper is a good place to eat in the I-D if you like your Chinese food hot. Another great event courtesy of the Queen of UYE. We migrated around 2 round tables with lazy susans. The glass lazy susans spin on a center shaft and not on planetary bearings (helps ease heavy loads/easier to spin). It isn't exactly in a convenient location for perhaps most people, so that's something to contend with. I do appreciate how they decor'ed it. We had quite the spread of different dishes and asking me what everything was would be like asking me what are 5 common cooking ingredients. :P I enjoyed some of the food; while being careful to avoid my arch enemies: the weird seafood.Don't get me wrong, it's a great place for certain people, it's just not my cup o' tea. Awesome Hot Pot!Came here with a group of fellow yelpers on one of Jennifer's (UYE Queen) famous chow downs.We had hot pot galore with shrimp,beef and other filling's with a couple of other dishes that we wolf down like a pack of hyenas and then help ourselves to the next table as well.There staff was real attentive as the plates were coming and going.It was well worth the 11 bucks I even got leftovers and Jennifers killer homemade cookies to top off the night.Well definitely come back again and try the rest of there menu!! One sentence summary: &#160;It's a worthy Chinese restaurant in the armpit of Little Saigon, but there are probably better places to eat nearby.They have some interesting dishes, along with hot pot options. &#160;Good service, but that's nothing new. &#160;Their dishes are about $11. &#160;Not bad food. &#160;But some of the dishes weren't so great. &#160;But I will say this: none of the dishes were those crappy old-school super-goopy dishes like almond chicken -- all the dishes seemed fresh and somewhat healthy.I hate to say this but the atmosphere is pretty run down. &#160;I mean, I'm not an elitist or anything... okay, maybe I am. &#160;But atmosphere is important to me. &#160;This place is like a cafeteria. &#160;Not that there's anything wrong with that. &#160;And their lazy susans are too modern for my taste -- well, now I truly sound like an elitist.Actually, I guess I like the atmosphere of the outside better than the inside: you park in the super-small parking lot, CD traffic is buzzing by on Jackson, you pass by the Sanrio knock-off store and eerie Chinese law firm, then you walk up the communist-era staircase, etc. The lunch specials are a really good deal here at $5.95-$6.95 per entree. Entrees are served with hot &amp; sour or egg flower soup and steamed rice and runs from 11am-3pm, Monday thru Friday. &#160;It's a good way to sample many of their dishes at an affordable price. &#160;One item that is not on their lunch menu but I love is their the Szechuan Dan Dan Noodles with Pork made with their hand shaven noodles. &#160;I love the flavors of this dish and the consistency of their hand shaven noodles. The noodles are thick and rustic. The hot pot is also really good option with all the various meats, seafood and vegetables and is a steal at around $12 per person. The hot pot can be served with either spicy or non-spicy broth. &#160;And, is best enjoyed with friends. &#160;You have to cook your own food but with all the chicken, beef, shrimp and veggies you get it's totally worth it. I attended one of Jennifer L's UYEs here. It was a great place to serve a large group of hungry yelpers!The location is in a strip mall with an odd parking lot/garage. I chose to park on the street a few storefronts away which was more convenient. Up an elevator and you're there at the restaurant.Our party was two large tables of about 10-12ppl each. For a weekday, it was pretty slow for them which is great for all! :)Jennifer L was our masterful leader who placed an order for several varied items. The menu was overwhelming otherwise:The hand shaven dan dan noodles, which were a popular pick in reading up on this place was spot on. There is more sauce underneath the top layer. Yum. Seafood hot pot, of course. It came with tons of veggies, seafood and took 2-3 rounds of cooking (by Keoni) to get everything hot and dished out. The daily special of chopped pepper fish, was just okay. Mainly, I was impressed at how tiny the veggies (green beans and other stuff) were chopped. The dish was spicy (just the warm kind, not crazy hot), light, and fresh-tasting. I wasn't a huge fan of drunken smoked duck, too much bone, not enough meat! The Szechuan chicken was yummier and meatier. :)The food came out in phases, which was good because there was no room on the table. Hello peanut sauce! And lazy susan for rotating the goodiess. Thanks to Keoni for serving the hot pot and everyone's part in demolishing the goods. The damage was like $12/pp. Smashing deal. Definitely on my list to return! Seriously, I have yet to find a place better than Seven Star pepper. &#160;Have you ever had that one dish that haunts you day after day after going to a restaurant? &#160;Its a rare thing to experience but I think that my blind trip to Seven Star has resulted in a serious addiction.Dan Dan Mien noodles..Thick, hand cut noodles in a rich peanut sauce. &#160;Hotpot with mixed meats, half spicy and half smooth broth. &#160;Boiled beef with Sichuan peppers, crispy duck with lemongrass. &#160;Their fried rice blows every other offering I've had in the city out of the water and into orbit. &#160;But seriously, its the Dan Dan Mien noodles that need to be tried to be believed. &#160;These dishes have left a really deep impression that I can't shake off. &#160;I've been there nearly 7 times now and I can't stop craving their authentic, spicy offerings. &#160;I'm still branching out, but we are surprised every time we try something new. &#160;They really know their stuff.Its a fantastic place to bring a group of friends to and have a nice long dinner with a bunch of booze. &#160;Parking is free in the complex also, which is a nice plus. &#160;I can't recommend this place enough, its made me crave Chinese food again on a daily basis.
I wound up at the Ould Triangle for an open-mike night on a Wednesday evening not too long ago. I don't generally do open-mike nights... wait, let me clarify... I have never done open-mike nights before, because it never really crossed my mind to do so. So I was a bit surprised to find myself at the Ould Triangle with my acoustic guitar, for an open-mike night, on that particular Wednesday evening.So what happened that led me here, you ask? Well, even if you didn't, I'm going to tell you anyway. I'm wordy like that. I met British singer/song-writer Tea For One (Neil Wardleworth) and his girlfriend Emma at the Dubliner while playing Rock Band. They had shown up for an open-mike night that was advertised somewhere on the internet, but apparently hasn't happened at the Dubliner for quite some time. Instead, he and Emma wound up playing Rock Band with us, and we got to talking about music, touring, etc.Later in the evening, he pulled out his guitar and we had our own little open-mike night, trading songs, talking, and generally having a great time. He and Emma complimented me on my singing and playing, and invited me out to the Ould Triangle for a Wednesday Open Mike with them. This was a pretty huge compliment considering how good Neil is.And so, ladies and gentlemen, I found myself at the Ould Triangle with my acoustic guitar, about to play songs for a crowd of people I had never met, songs that I've only ever really played for about 3 people previously.The Ould Triangle has that old pub feel. Wood and leather, with an outdoor patio with lots of covered tables. Their selection of beer is wide, they've got a lot of booze behind the bar, darts, billiards/pool, and a couple video games in a corner.There isn't much food to order here, except things like potato chips or nuts. However, the bartender told me they have a big list of menus of local delivery places, and you can order food in.Anyway, I walked in, met Neil and Emma there, we ordered a couple rounds for each other, and listened to the Open-mike "administrator" begin the evening. Neil was on next, and he rocked it. He's got a great voice, a great musical style. I bought a couple of his albums off iTunes, they're less than $4 and worth it. Find it from his MySpace page: http://www.myspace.com/t&#8230;A couple other folks got up and played their songs. There was a full range of talent there, from pro musician (Neil) to semi-pro, to hobbyist crooners. By the time it was my turn, I was unusually nervous; I play live shows often, but playing bass and singing backups in a loud rock band is a much different experience from sitting up there alone, just you and an acoustic, singing your own songs.The crowd was really supportive, even when my acoustic's pick-up broke and I had to borrow Neil's guitar. I played my songs, got a great reaction, and felt really good about it. Everyone came up afterward, complimented my singing and song-writing, and were really supportive.I'll definitely come back some time, though I'll need to get my guitar fixed first.
It is dull.The food was mediocre and expensive for mediocre.The staff was one friendly and another lack-a-daisical.I picked up a NY Times &#160;and got growled at that I took someone's paper. How would I know!!!!????Regulars rule!Never going back. Three stars for three things: the ambient decor with plenty of seating space, the hot turkey sandwich, and the only blueberry pancakes worth going out for. These are the things that, unlike everything else, do not feel overpriced. I've never had an exceptionally good experience here, but I've also never had an exceptionally bad one either (now, my boyfriend, who was once served cold waffles and eggs, would definitely disagree -- but let him make his own Yelp account for that). I also feel like I would do a lot of studying here, if I ever had homework that didn't involve an easel or a 2x3' screen.So, if you have a 100-page course pak to read and you stick to the aforementioned food choices, you probably won't be too disappointed. Been going here for years and I find myself in agreement with many of the other reviewers here. The coffee is pretty good, the environment is dim but comfortable, with lots of table space to get studying done. The food is definitely WAY overpriced and not usually worth it. I tried one of their "gourmet" burgers last night and was not impressed. The picture on their banner is blatant false advertising -- it's just a stock photo of a cheeseburger, what I received didn't even have the same ingredients. The ciabatta-esque bun was nice but everything else was dry. Should have taken my burger business across the street to A Burger Place. They are evil evil evil since I know I'll keep coming back regardless of the sky-high prices, the rubbery/bland food and coffee that should be ashamed to call itself that. Why? It's in a primo location which is probably the only reason they stay in business and the tables are good for study sessions. And the service isn't bad. They've played CD's on repeat which can make one never forget their headphones again.Smoothies are possibly worse than the coffee as they have no resemblance to real fruit and taste like (bad) pureed Yoplait with ice. Even their damned ice teas are pricey and they only have one flavor. *runs to Zoka's*And chai lattes are one of my favorite drinks in the world which happened to taste nothing like chai ... or much milk. Just a vague watery concoction of nutmeg. Blegh. I've had some great coffee and finished a couple of papers here. It usually seems filled with studying students, so... it's definitely not an exciting place to be.It's usually super busy so there are few (if any) seats available. The food is a tad expensive and I usually don't like to order it because you have to wait around for your number to get called (and, from my experience, they are kind of slow).My favorite thing about this spot is the (small) outdoor seating area. It's perfect for enjoying a warm beverage (during cold weather) and people watching. I stopped in at 12:45 on Thursday to pick up a sandwich to go, figuring I'd have plenty of time to get back to my office a half block away in time for a 1:00 teleconference. Unfortunately, although there was no line at the counter when I placed my order, my roasted tofu sandwich was not ready until 1:10. Not only was I late for my conference call, the sandwich was not all that good, especially given its $9 price tag.Hillside Quickies makes much better tofu sandwiches, even though that is also not a good place to go when in a hurry (despite their name). Seattleans are so lucky to have mom'n'pop coffee shops everywhere. I don't have that luxury in So Cal.Anyway, my awesome hostess took us to explore the beautiful U-Dub campus and afterwards, we were all ready for some HOT coffee. Cafe on the Ave is definitely one of those college joints - lots of students studying; I imagine that there is free wi-fi. The place is outfitted with sofas, chairs and tables, and bar area. &#160;Oh yeah, Cafe on the Ave also serves sandwiches too. I had a maple coffee latte thing and guys, it was amazing. It wasn't too sugary, the coffee wasn't charred (like CHARBUCKS) and it had the right amount of milk. &#160;My cohorts ordered a strawberry lemonade and a pumpkin latte, which were both good (by their accounts). If I had to knock on this place it would be the slow service. I think there were two baristas and we waited quite a bit (7 minutes?) for our order. :\ETA: Wow, maybe I came in on an off day? I've been here a few times, to study with people from class and to meet friends. It's ok. The staff is usually really friendly. I had soup once...it was good. One time I had a cookie and it was good, too. It's cozy. The best thing about this place is that they serve Cafe Vita. I've been coming here at least twice a week for the past few months. Once the staff (Song and Chrissy) started to notice that I was a semi-regular, they bothered to learn my name and greet me with a friendly hello every time I stop by. I think that deserves a few stars. As for the stuff that you pay money for, I have to agree that most of the food is mediocre and overpriced. However, the bagel sandwiches are the exception; simple and made with quality ingredients. The same can be said for the pancakes and eggs benedict. They are a tad bit overpriced, but ever since IHOP closed there's really no other place near the ave to get decent breakfast food (excluding Portage Bay Cafe, when I feel like paying $15 for an omelet). I'm one of the few Seattlites who actually likes black coffee, and these guys happen to serve Cafe Vita, so no complaints there. Basically, this place is awesome if you like good drip coffee and decent breakfast food, pretty average for everything else. In a word: yuck.While the setting is nice, we experienced severe problems every step of the way through our breakfast.- The person ringing us up was only half paying attention to us. &#160;She double-billed us for one of the things we ordered. &#160;No one working knew how to process a refund, so we stood around for several minutes while they worked it out.- Our food (french toast and the breakfast combo of hash browns, sausage, toast and eggs) sat on the window from the kitchen for a couple minutes before anyone bothered themselves to bring it to us.- The french toast was absolutely, utterly vile. &#160;They charged $6.50, not a terrible price for real french toast, but this wasn't real french toast. &#160;It was two slices of bread, apparently just toasted in a toaster, wrapped in scrambled eggs. &#160;They gave us a refund, but that they serve this dish at all is awful.- The breakfast special cost $8 and was not worth half that. &#160;The hash browns were burnt on the outside and soggy on the inside, there was a single slice of burnt toast with no jam or anything to accompany it, and the "three eggs" looked like two at most and were poorly scrambled, cold and dry. &#160;To their credit, the sausage was actually pretty good. &#160;Still, most greasy spoon type diners would charge $5 for a similar breakfast and it would be a lot better.The coffee was average, but expensive.Plenty of far better (and cheaper) places to get breakfast around here.
I'm partial to hippie-food. No wait, scratch that. True hippie food is squash and wild rice with cumin on it served in a drafty house with crappy plumming...in Oregon. I'm partial to food that is hippie-esque, like whole grains, taters with the skins on, whole rainbows of spices in one dish, sprouted stuff, and things that taste organic even if they're not. So that makes Sound View the place for me. Their huevos ranchers estan muy bueno - sabes? Only downside - if you can call it that - is that their portions are too big. I'm a pretty big guy with a pretty big appetite. I eat entire watermelons by myself. But I still have to split whatever I'm getting at Sound View with a friend.
This food is amazing. I decided t ogive this place a try after newly moving within their delivery zone. The food was delievered promptly... although I thought it strange the delivery guy didn't even offer back change when I over paid him (not that I needed it). I was extremley impressed with the food. The individual meal I ordered at $10 easily fed the two of us. The Mongolian Beef was seasoned perfectly, and spiced as ordered. It was mighty tasty! The Sweet and Sour Pork was slightly rubbery, but the sauce and huge chunks of pineapple made up for it. The Hot and Sour Soup is A+++ and veggie eggrolls were good, too!I am definatley ordering again! I think chef at wok is the best Chinese food places in town. &#160;If you're in their area give them a try. &#160;The portions are fair/large, and the food tastes fresh.
I've gone to this restaurant twice now. &#160;And every time the food has been fantastic. &#160;Last time I had the sampler plate, which included sausage jumbalaya, crawfish pie, &#160;and shrimp gumbo. &#160;They were to die for. Very savory with perfect amount of seasoning without being overwhelming. &#160;And the owners are extremely friendly. This place had the most happenin Fat Tuesday I have ever seen in Seattle! &#160;The food is good and the staff is cool. &#160;For the guy opining for Chef Pruds' brah, it's a totally different ballgame than a chain restaraunt.
Mmmm, finally I have time to try their philly cheese steak. So. Damn. Good. What can you complain about? The tender and juicy meat? The ever so tasty sauce with cheese that melts into your mouth as you bite into it? The mushrooms and green bell peppers that are sauteed so well it's almost caramelized? I just drooled in my mouth, oops. I don't care how long I have to wait because this food is so damn fresh. They make it when you order it. So good quality. Just like their cheese fries, Mmmmm too. And their wings. The best tasting chicken wings I've ever had damn it. I don't care what anybody says, this place is worth the wait for the quality and taste. Yes, they can get busy, but that's how you know it's good. I've never had bad experiences with Philly's. They're super friendly, and always have sports on, oh yeah baby! :)Try their deluxe Philly (that's what I got). If you want chicken, get their wing special. If you want fries, or if you don't want fries, get their cheese fries with chicken anyway. You won't regret it! this place is a god damn hole in the wall, but &#160;they serve the best philly cheesesteak sandwich this side of the mississippi. I really love this place and don't mind driving about a half hour from the east side to enjoy their &#160;always delicious sandwiches. It was a good sandwich, but I was definitely not blown away. I should give them two stars, but seeing as how I've only been here once I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.Here are the main points of my experience:- The service was not friendly. Borderline rude, actually. I had never been there before and the man taking my order seemed really irritated with me because I didn't know what I wanted right away.- There was ONE order of two sandwiches ahead of me, but I still waited for nearly 25 minutes. - I did NOT find it cheap. For two sandwiches and a can of Hawaiian Punch, my total was a few cents under $20. As far as sandwiches go, for that price I'd much rather have a fish sandwich in West Seattle or even make the trek up to the Northend for some Paseo's. - The sandwiches were long, but not very wide, meaning that there wasn't actually a ton of substance to them. If I were super hungry, one probably would not suffice without an order of fries or a side to fill me up.- It was hotter than hell inside that place and also not very clean.- The parking lot is small and awkward.Would I go back? Probably, if I'm in the mood for cheesy, fatty goodness. But I'd definitely make whoever I'm with go in to get it. i came it wasn't so busy..they have ms.pacman .. there fries are tasty &amp; the sandwich is good. i haven't even left the parking lot.. yes i can say the meat well seasoned ..now i am omw to catfish corner for there tarter sauce..it was good enough for me too come back here on new years but they were closed.. yes i drove from puyallup until someone in pierce county can show me good eats i'll head north anyday.. My coworker tried this place a few weeks ago and has been talking about it ever since. Since she is very picky about what qualifies as "good" food, I knew it had to be good for her to keep bringing it up. Today, I made the run for lunch and was not disappointed. Got stopped at a bunch of lights on the way back to Belltown and coudln't resist taking a bite... which lead to devouring my whole sandwich before I hit the parking lot. Super good. Juicy. Lots of peppers, onions, etc. Good flavor on the beef. Perfect ratio of mayo. Fries had great seasoning. Well worth the trip from Belltown.
Overpriced, overhyped, and totally confusing to me -- other than the gimmick of a rotating menu, the food is completely average and the ambiance nothing special. So why are there dozens people waiting outside every weekend morning?--UPDATED--Ok, so I've known for years that brunches at Coastal Kitchen are mediocre, but it had been a long time since I'd had dinner there, and when my father-in-law was in town the other night, I convinced my husband to try Coastal Kitchen just one more time....How in the world is this place so popular? They were out of half the things on the (already small) menu and my shrimp linguine was soggy and bland. It wasn't terrible by any means, but it certainly wasn't worth $18. I was so ready to give the Coastal Kitchen another shot ... but it underperformed for the Nth time.As I looked around the restaurant, I had to wonder how it is that an overpriced place with completely "meh" food is always so packed. I mean, I've lived in this hood for over a decade, and Coastal Kitchen has never not been packed! This place is a perennial 15th Ave Favorite for so many people ... and every single time I go I'm stumped as to why. I don't get it. I've been to this restuarant several times (after the first couple of times, with friends who insisted on going), and I'm just not impressed. The brunch is better (and menu more varied) two blocks away at the Kingfish (and there usually isn't a line), and their regular menu just doesn't live up the hype. I think people go there because they can't think of another place open in the AM (maybe Denny's? Ihop?). And good lord, who thought it was a good idea to stuff cream corn into pancakes? I like going to Costal Kitchen for brunch, even if there is a line you can go to one of the coffee shops down the street for a latte to kill some time. It has exactly what i'd want out of a brunch menu, enough sweet and savory dishes, the traditional spread plus some creative omelets too.As for dinner, this is for the low-ish rating. It isn't anything to shout about for the price. &#160;I have been here a handful of times with acceptable results, but if you do research Seattle has a lot more to offer as far as restaurants in this bracket go. &#160;I do have vegetarian friends that rave about it, but your standards are different when you are omitting meat. I seem to go to a lot of breakfast places when I am in Seattle. Oh well. &#160;Anyway, I really like coastal kitchen. &#160;Solid breakfast foods, good baked items and interesting concept of the rotating culinary foods of the world.I especially like the "language" tapes they play and pipe into the restrooms. (you'll find out when you go).I particularly like their scrambles and have not been disappointed with them. I love Chow Foods. the food is always exceptional, as is the service. &#160;Last night we dropped into Coastal Kitchen after Ten and with a party of nine. &#160;Unfortunately, the three spots which will hold a party of that size were all occupied but the staff did the best they could squeezing us into a couple of abutting booths. &#160;The menu has moved to Costa Rica for the month and has some very appetizing entrees. &#160;The black bean soup looked wonderful, honey sweetened sour cream? who knew. The featured salad with mango and coconut, yum. &#160;I ordered the ceviche, I am a sucker for raw fish. &#160;(OK ceviche isn't technically raw. &#160;The fish is "cooked" with lime juice. &#160;For more info on how this works check out this website. http://www.fiery-foods.c&#8230; ) &#160;Mixed with regional fruits and veggies the ceviche is served in three little tortilla cups with a little avocado and cabbage on the side. &#160;The portion was the perfect post rehearsal/late(for me) night snack. &#160;Also ordered at our table was there three egg breakfast, served all day, and the tasty and inexpensive side of fries.The wine list featured a nice selection of South American wines but I had a hankering for some liquor. &#160;They don't stock my Bourbon of choice, Basil Haydon, so I ordered the faithful standby, Knob Creek, neat. &#160;$6.50 for the shot is &#160;pretty standard but you can make it a double for $2.50 more, I'll have two please. Coastal Kitchen is one of those places that you bring your friends for breakfast when they're in from out of town. &#160;The food is good, though not necessarily exceptional, and the atmosphere is cozy and buzzing. &#160;The rumbles are tasty and nourishing. If you're not absolutely starving, I've found that a breakfast dish is actually plenty large for two moderately hungry people-- and at that rate, the food is very affordable! &#160;I'm not a big fan of their hashbrowns, though, and their coffee isn't anything special- &#160;I usually get my soy latte from the Ladro down the street and bring it in with me. &#160;They give me sideways looks but hey, if the coffee sucks then I'd rather spend my coffeebucks elsewhere. &#160;I can't speak to the lunch or dinner menus, as I usually only eat there for breakfast/brunch. &#160;And as with all the Chow restaraunts, the French Toast is delectable. &#160;Especially if they have a special concoction offered in the festival selection. Beautiful summer day + Lovely shaded patio +Excellent waiter and cute too (yes you the guy with dark brown hair and glasses) + Manageable wait time+ &#160;Goat Cheese Rumble+ Apricot Coffee Cake + Close friend from college = &#160; An &#160;excellent Seattle brunch experience. This is a long distance love affair that works! A love of mine for over 10 years now... Coastal Kitchen is one of my favorite breakfast places in Seattle. Whenever I am up from San Francisco I try to fit it in my schedule. I can only to speak to the breakfast/brunch menu items, mainly the various rumbles and coffee cake, but their menu does change every 6 weeks or so to include a new country influence and specialties. Yesterday it was Costa Rica, I was tempted to try the Pulled Pork Sandwich w/ some plantains but the goat cheese rumble with carmelized onions and spinach was calling to me and in summary all I can say is: &#160; yum! Thank god a local friend recommended this restaurant for dinner. As a weary traveller, I was a little hesitant to leave my hotel, but Coastal Kitchen made it so worth it. I had the pecan crusted salmon with avocado butter. It was absolutely delicious! Coastal Kitchen provides a relaxing, laid back atmosphere, very friendly and accomodating service and delicious food. Go here! My first impression was I love the atmosphere of this place. We got to seat outside in a narrow alleyway next to the restaurant building. It felt both cozy and open.Our server was great. Very attentive w/o hovering over the table. He did forget to tell us the specials but oh well. No biggie.The food was both creative and tasty. We went when the theme was Costa Rica and they did a great job with the ceviche. Looking forward to going back to try a new international theme. Its cool that they keep the menu dynamic. The fish on the regular menu is really good! Tastes fresh and lightly seasoned. The only thing that was disappointing was the dessert. We got a rum orange pound cake with icecream. Now I love rum (who doesn't?) but they poured way too much on it because it covered all the other flavors. The food wasn't cheap but it wasn't outrageous.All in all, I definitely would recommend this cute restaurant for anyone who either really likes seafood or likes to try new things on a menu. BEST BRUNCH IN SEATTLE!Even after having moved to foodie haven San Francisco, I STILL crave the Coastal. Their Satchmo's Way Omellete and hash browns have a spot in my heart. The griddle pancakes are the best ever. Was never a huge fan of their dinner fare, but loved their brunch. Anytime I'd have out of town guests visit, I'd make sure to get a group together and it was always a hit. If you see people waiting outside, it is SO worth it. I really like the idea of a rotating menu of specials based on different countries. I've been here for a lot of the themes, but my favorite so far has been the Greek theme. Opa!The great thing about Coastal Kitchen is that they still have their standards on the menu even when there's a theme, so if you go there with friends and you don't like Uzbekistani cuisine (not that there's anything wrong with that), you can get a steak or halibut or a burger and be very happy that you did.We've always had incredibly good service when we've come here, and never had to wait more than 15 minutes or so for a table -- and they can get seriously busy at this place! sonora scramble.period. It's okay. &#160;I really like the decor and atmosphere of the place, but the food was not memorable. I loved it when i went there for the first time after i did the Seattle Half Marathon back in November. Running for 13 miles and having a nice warm meal ANYWHERE would probably feel like heaven! =) Had the Skagit Ham Rumble...nothing really special here...scrambled eggs w/eggs, cheese, &#160;and scallions. The hash browns have a bit of kick to it but nothing too overpowering. &#160;Went again for the 2nd time a week ago and it still didn't impress me much. I had the Goat Cheese Rumble. &#160;Scrambled eggs w/spinach, onions and two huge dabs of goat cheese on top. I thought the cheese was too much and the flavors together were just "blah". It felt like it was missing something....maybe some meat. But that's just me. The boy had the Big Sur, an omelet w/ huge chunks of ham, avocado, and tomatoes. The ingredients did not meld together &#160;too well ...maybe because of the size of the ingredients. I did love my hot chocolate w/whip cream though. I'm pretty optimistic so i'd definitely come again and try out their lunch and dinner menu.
I order from here frequently, and I've usually been pretty happy.LOVE the online tracker. &#160;It may be one of the biggest reasons I order from here, in addition to the fact that I enjoy having food presented to me without having to get off my ass (other than to put on a bra to answer the door). &#160;Maybe I'm a control freak, and that's why it appeals to me, but the tracker shows you in real time what's going on with your order and when the delivery person is underway.Their pizza is "okay".. but I really like how you can customize from lots of toppings as you order from the website. &#160;Also their cheese breadsticks are the BOMB.Delivery is almost always prompt, though one time it took them over an hour and when I called, the guy answering the phone was rude to me. &#160;I almost always get Joi as my delivery driver, which is funny because I order at all different times/days; she must work there constantly. &#160;Anyway, Joi is always a Joy--a sweet lady, she is polite and always courteous, but respectfully quiet and not all up in your stuff like a lot of delivery drivers who make snide comments about your barking dogs and/or cheerfully need to talk for 5 minutes about traffic or the weather.Anyway, never any of those problems with Joi, which I appreciate. &#160;Overall, it's a good place to order from.
Honestly, the only reason this isn't 1 star is because the service was just fine, the restaurant seemed clean, and the ambiance was nice for generic pan-asian cuisine. But the food - the food is just not good. I would not ever pay to go back here. I had been to Chinoise when it was on 45th, but forgot about the experience when meeting some friends at the Queen Anne location until I walked in. The food, as noted by other reviewers, is just bland. Barely a notch above Safeway Chinese. If you're going to pay $12-$15 for fried rice or tofu and green beans you should either be getting something pretty delicious or just okay but tons of it. This is neither. The portions are regular sized, and every item we ordered (from pot stickers to the BASIL fried rice - emphasis on the basil, to the happy hour sushi rolls) were just boring and leaving you wanting more. I'm all for a quick in-and-out sit down meal if your in the neighborhood, but this place just was so not worth it when there are so many other great places to eat in Queen Anne and Seattle. Bottom line, greasy, overpriced, bland food. I've had food from Chinoise Cafe about 4 times over the last six months. &#160; When it is good it is good, when it is mediocre it is mediocre. &#160;Three out of four times the salmon cerviche roll was delicious, same with the dinner (although not the same visit). &#160; Service is good, although they do not necessarily pick up the phone the first time you call. If I could, I would give this place a negative 15 stars. What kind of place makes you pay for your food and doesn't apologize right away after you chomp on your second bite to discover a piece of wire digging into your cheek? Chinoise does. I was horrified to see a piece of wire (the kind you wrap the plastic of your sandwich bread with) come out of my mouth after feeling something very unpleasant poking my skin. When my bf took it up to the chef, he merely stared at him and said, "It's just a piece of wire.. go back to eating your food." Are you serious?! He finally offered an apology after having a staring session, and the server switched out the disgustingly tainted Ha Moon Noodles for another dish at my request. Who knows where that wire even came from and what it is was used for??? At the least, I expected a free meal, which I didn't get. They made us pay, and only provided an employee discount of $1.60. I will never go back, and highly suggest you to go somewhere else.
free wireless, $3.50 sushi rolls, espresso, and STRONG mixed drinks = welcome to my neighborhood! i hope you'll stay awhile.update: i came here after 11pm last week, desperate for some food. alas, they were out of rice for the sushi, and getting a few pieces of sashimi on a plate took an hour. i thought i would die of hunger. it wasn't the fault of the waitress... they were really busy, and i'm assuming the sushi chef was on break or something. just don't come here if you're in a hurry and desperate for food ;) we ended up giving up and going to qfc.
I have been here twice, service is good, personality-wise non there. But thats typical of an Asian restaurant in this area. hehe =)Both times I ordered the Bun Bo Hue, they make it pretty good here, theres seriously enough to feed two small people, I am bigger than most women so I could almost finish it. I still have meat leftover, but I dont take it home. The soup is served nice and hot, with a tray of fresh basil, shredded banana flower, bean sprouts, cilantro. Theres a tray of sauces you can add into your soup. I don't add anymore salty sauces because I feel like the sauce is flavored enough, I only add HOT PEPPER!! WHOOO LOVE it, &#160;but it wasn't spicy here =( (the dried pepper in oilAnyway, I would give them a 1 star for not making it more comfortable for us to eat by using the RESTROOMS THAT CLEARLY HAVE ONE FOR MEN AND ONE FOR WOMEN. For some reason its not for use by the Public, so I find it rude and teasing, especially because I really wanted to wash my hands since I was just at the Laundromat and my hands smelled like bleach and soap. Anywho....won't be going here that often especially if I want to relax and take my time to eat. I didn't mind so much this time because I was in a hurry to have a quick meal and go back to drying my clothes, but overall food is decent and atmosphere very pretty. GOOD LUCK. Make sure you don't come in needing to wash your hands or pee before your meal. =/ This was my first and last time at this resturant. &#160;I waited 30 mins for my Banh Xeo, which didn't make sense since the other two tables have already been served. My Banh Xeo was a joke! &#160;The shrimp was attached to the crepe and the inside only had bean spout. &#160;I didn't realize that the shrimp was not deshell and I almost chocked. &#160;When I ask the server she was not very nice about it. &#160;She said that it was always made that way. &#160;That was crazy! &#160;I have had Banh Xeo and it was never like that. &#160;She kept trying to say it was not their fault. &#160;I guess she got tired of defending herself and offered to make another one. &#160;No thanks! &#160;It took them 30 min to make one Banh Xeo and I didn't have more time to deal with this nonsense. &#160;On their menu they should state that it has shells in their Banh Xeo so people will know what to expect when they order. &#160;Horrible service! Love this place, their pho is less than $6. &#160;Their hot tea is always great not like the recyled kind, you know what i mean. &#160;Wait staff's very friendly tool.
Very reasonable prices. Really good food. - parking is easy (with lot in back)- spicy means spicy- avocado shakes are bizarre, but oddly delicious I've been a couple of times now and have tried their different noodle soups. The last one I had was the fish ball and fish cake egg noodle soup. I definitely devoured all of it. This was one of the few restaurants open past 8 p.m. with a parking lot, so we came here after the Sounders game. It was freezing and raining that night so hot soup was much needed.We also ordered the fried tofu appetizer which was a HUGE portion! The tofu was good when it was hot, but after a few minutes of cooling, it becomes pretty tasteless.My noodle soup was delish... there's something about their egg noodles that I really enjoyed - I think it was saltier than other noodles that I've had, and I liked that. The fish cake and fish balls were exactly what I was craving so those hit the spot too.Service was quick and friendly. The only complaint I have is the parking lot and how it's an odd turn getting to the restaurant coming from Rainier Ave S.... I always have trouble finding the right entrance to the lot, and have to loop around the neighborhood to get in... maybe it's just me. I really like this place. They serve a special with broth, noodles, shrimp and chicken. &#160;Everyone should try this dish. It is very good and the price is reasonable. &#160;I am now a fan. Egg rolls are good. Soup is great. They deliver. Delivery guy was friendly. I've been a customer here since I was a little girl. Let me tell you, they have some of the best mi noodle soup around town. The house special fried rice is also delicious. Customer service is always good and this place has definitely improved in the last years.I seem to always get the same thing. Roasted duck noodle soup, but I'm sure there are a lot of delightful items on the menu. I love the pickled jalape&#241;o!! They can be a bit spicy, so be careful. =P Situated on Ranier near Goodwill. &#160; This is one of the few restaurants that houses its own parking lot. &#160; The food is terrific for a comfort homestyle feel.I will always get their signature egg noodles, fried chicken and soup on the side. &#160;Always order the fried donut and side of chinese sausage.Service is decent and pricing is very affordable and fullfilling! Love this little family owned restaurant. My family and I have been coming here for years. I only order one thing here, Duck noodle soup, dry with soup on the side with thick egg noodles.. It is AMAZING. The service is great and friendly. I love seeing the grandma come of the of the kitchen to give us our plates. Low key, and they have their own parking lot if you don't want to fuss with Chinatown! yes, i'm a fan. duh! Great Vietnamese noodles here at great prices. Sometimes I'll get tired of pho (imagine that hehe) and go here for noodle souple. I like their egg noodle soup with pork, duck and shrimp. Yummo!The prices here are very reasonable. There's some parking available and this place is a good option if you want to go to Chinatown but don't realy want to go to Chinatown (or the International District). I called in a to-go order at 2:00 p.m. &#160;I waited until 2:18 to leave for the restaurant. &#160;i arrived there at 2:20. &#160;I didn't leave with my food until $2:35. &#160;I ordered shrimp spring rolls and noodle soup, not fillets of nearly extinct land mammals. &#160;It wasn't really their fault, though.During my wait, there was a customer (granted, who had been seated with 2 adult family members and six children aged as if they were born in rapid succession) complaining about the fact that tables around her who had arrived after her were served &#160;before her. &#160;I knew she was trying to play a race card- she was not Vietnamese, and was implying that her race was the reason she hadn't been served as swiftly as those around her. &#160;She pointed at 3 other tables with one or two people at each, as if to garner sympathy. &#160;I wished I could have said "Lady, you have brought your child army and team of handlers! &#160;You can't even handle all that has flown out your cooter for the last 4.5 years by yourself! &#160;What did you expect?!"She left 3 tables pushed together a complete mess. &#160;Food and utensils were everywhere. &#160;She didn't even tip. &#160;I hope she got a flat tire on the way home. Been coming here for a decade I think, even back when it was called 'Blue Lagoon'.House noodle soup; soup together, half-n-half (half egg, half rice noodle), and chinese doughnut! &#160;Big whole fried head-on shrimp on top, one piece of fried chicken, pork slices, and wonderful broth. &#160;Pile on the jalapenos, and some table condiments, i love it. Good food. Super slow service. They bring out my chicken wings like 20 minutes AFTER I have finished my duck noodle soup. I thought they had forgotten, but she kept saying it was coming. Waitress never came to the tables to refill waters. Had to ask for everything. I like this place but it is always slow, even when they are not that busy. I like their wings, but this is the second time I had to wait forever for it. Another time I came and got take out and it took FOREVER too. Geezus. At least they stay busy. I guess I shouldn't be ordering the chicken wings since that is what takes the longest. I'll be back though. Food is pretty good. 5 words, Mi La Cay Dac Biet. &#160;This is not your plain wonton noodle soup, we're talking fried chicken, braised pork, tempura shrimp, veggies, all in soup and egg noodles. &#160;My friend would take me here annually for my birthday, and now i come all the time as i've moved closer to the I.D.
I love the rolls! They are big, big, big at a really great price. Nice, cozy atmosphere, great location and friendly and efficient service. They serve both lunch and dinner and you get a side of miso soup with all their rolls. They also have a long list of appetizer selections such as bacon wrapped asparagus. Good stuff!Great sake selection. Hot sake, cold sake, large bottles, medium bottles. They serve wine and beer too. A little hole in the wall that they have done up right with track lighting and deep red walls. I've been to Obasan a number of times since they opened and will continue to go back for more! Becky L's ROTD convinced me to come here for lunch today (again)!I haven't had quite her luck with the service, but they've been polite on both of my visits.What do I love at Obasan? The special bento lunch! For $9 you get delicious miso soup, a lot of tempura veggies, four California roll pieces, two potstickers, a tasty salad, AND four pieces of nigiri (chef's choice). Today one of those pieces of fish was so big that I couldn't eat it all in one bite!It's not quite 5-stars for me (yet), but it's already one of my favorite spots to grab lunch in Queen Anne! Yay! Another place to eat in lower Queen Anne! Their bento boxes are probably the best value for your money. They are huge! They come with a gyoza and a tiny chicken skewer...things I have never seen before in a bento box. Also included are 6 pieces of california roll, tempura (including shrimp), salad, and your entree choice. I can never finish everything...I tend to leave the rest of my tempura behind. The only disappointment is that rice does not come with the entree, which I think is a bit strange. How can I eat my meat without any rice?I want to try some of their rolls, but I can't seem to get past how great of a deal the bento boxes are. This restaurant in my opinion, is one of the best japanese/sushi restaurants in the western washington. A good friend of mine took me once, and I have been a loyal customers since. I have been here half a dozen times, and each time I visit, I like this place even more.First, the bento boxes are just truly amazing. I have many bento boxes before, but this restaurant fills the entire box full with delicious items, from california rolls, salad, tempura, entree of your choice, and other food items that the chef prepared. For tempura alone, you'll get 5 or 6 pieces. The portions are truly generous and the food quality is great. And yes, they comes with rice and soup too. My favorite entrees for the bento are teriyaki chicken (great tasting sauce) and ginger pork.Next, Happy Hours - They offer $1 nigiri, and also handrolls and a great selection of beers at amazing prices. I've took my co-workers here after work for Happy Hours and we had a blast. Definitely a cozy place to hang out with co-workers / friends after work. They do get busy, so be there early to ensure you get a table.Thirdly, sushi rolls. Actions speak louder than words. Just order one sushi roll, and I guarantee you that you'll fall in love with the artistry and the awesome flavors of their sushi rolls. Again, the portions are generous. I particularly like their Firefly roll, Geisha roll, Obasan roll, and most importantly, their " TK roll ". "TK roll" is not on their menu, but you need to order this specialty item - It is huge and so yummy that it is on my order every time I visit this place.Finally, service. We've been getting good service every time we went there. The waitress is very nice and friendly. The food is served fairly quickly after we ordered. And she is very attentive and patient. Overall, my experience there has been great!If there are anything I am not happy about, is that I wish this place is closer to the Eastside or if they have a branch over here. Hey, if I'm willing to drive 30 minutes across the bridge to eat there on the weekend... that means it is definitely worth checking this place out. I will admit that, like most other people reviewing here, I am basing my 5 stars solely on their lunch bento. After reading the awesome reviews I stopped by here for a take out lunch. I don't think the reviews prepared me for how wow-ed I was at the piles of tasty food waiting for me when I opened the plastic to-go container back at work!For a grand total of $9.90, I got a lunch that could feed a hungry wolf, two regular people for lunch, or an army of children (your choice). I ordered the ginger pork (very tasty), and it also came with:-4 california rolls (good quality), - a bazillion pieces of veggie tempura (each piece was a different vegetable &amp; there was one yummy shrimp in their too), -a salad (not the bland stuff you usually get -- mixed greens &amp; broccoli!), AND -2 gyoza!It was delicious &amp; I will DEFINITELY be back for more. I couldn't finish it all, so will probably bring the bf next time to split it &amp; an extra roll with me. (Oh &amp; they gave me a bowl of miso while I waited!) First off, I am not a huge fan of sushi or Japanese cuisine. After saying that, this place was awesome! I ordered the dinner Bento Box ($14) and all i can say is "Wow that's a lot of food." The Bento box includes -1 entree (i got the short ribs) -4 California rolls (incredible) -a salad (great dressing) -fried veggies -2 dumplings -miso soup They have a large amount of different sushi for $.99 you cannot go wrong! Service is awesome but not fountain drinks A friend had suggested this place too many times to count, and yesterday I finally checked it out for the first time during my lunch break. &#160;When I got back to the office I immediately recommended it to several coworkers. &#160;I'm vegetarian so I cannot attest to the quality/freshness of the seafood used here (although my omnivorous companion rates it among the best in this neighborhood, which is saying something since there are two other Japanese restaurants on this block alone), but as with most sushi restaurants there were plenty of veggie options. &#160;I was recovering from a nasty flu, so went with just the miso soup ($1.50) and seaweed salad ($5.00). &#160; My friend ordered one of the bento box lunch specials ($9.00), which not only looked beautiful but was HUGE. &#160;Enough food for two filling lunches. &#160;The miso soup I ordered was very basic. &#160;It hit the spot, but there wasn't anything special about it. &#160;The seaweed salad, on the other hand, was fantastic. &#160;Wakame seaweed (a mild variety perfect for those who shy away from stronger, fishier varieties like hijiki) was tossed in a vibrant, assertive dressing with notes of toasted sesame, ginger, red pepper and shoyu. &#160;It's tough for me to find a place that makes seaweed salad to my tastes (most seem to be drenched in soy sauce) and this was not only uber-flavorful but quite substantial. &#160;What further sets this place apart is the friendly, patient staff. &#160; I don't eat out for lunch often, so when I do I don't like feeling as if I'm just another cog in the "lunch rush" wheel; a numbered patron at a numbered table that the waitstaff care more about turning than pleasing. &#160;Even though she was the only one working the tables, our waitress was calm, kindly and attentive. &#160;At no point did we feel neglected or rushed. &#160;In short: Obasan offers bright, delicious food at a remarkable value and they gild the lily with excellent service. Favorite. Happy Hour. Evar. (Well... until the next favorite!)The poke is so cheap and delicious, I could seriously eat it everyday! &#160;They make it to order, in house, and the flavor is out of this world. &#160;The nigiri are the biggest pieces I have found anywhere for the price. &#160;Some sushi purists say that the nigiri here is too big, but I say more for the money, and more in my tummy! &#160;The miso soup was pretty weak, I would not order that again. &#160;Of course, they have Kirin Ichiban at wonderful happy hour special prices. It isn't draft and I would have liked a chilled glass with my bottle, but alas. &#160;The interior is simple and not fussy, great for people watching if you get a view of the street through the big windows up front. &#160;If you are facing the other direction... you get to watch anime! Cool! Our waitress was super nice and was very interested in how we liked our food, and asked how we thought it compared to other sushi happy hours around the area. &#160;Obasan seems genuinely interested in providing good food, good atmosphere, and good service- well done you guys! Came for happy hour last night and had a mediocre experience here. The big draw for happy hour is the great price ($1 hand rolls, $4 large rolls, and $1 nigiri). I've been to a fair amount of sushi restaurants and the food was good overall. The best things we ate were the spicy salmon hand rolls, the gyoza, and the spicy tuna rolls (all great prices too!). The egg rolls were ordinary like the frozen kind I could make out of a box. I usually dont order the california roll (since its made with fake crab) but one of my friends did and its was just ok, nothing special. Also, the seaweed salad got mixed reviews from my table.With a pretty decent food experience, the service was really lacking. Numerous mishaps of us waiting, not getting silver ware, waiting for our nigiri they forgot to make, and then waiting for the check. Overall, with the service, I'll probably go some where else for happy hour next time but I am still tempted to come back to try their lunch bento boxes everyone's raving about and hopefully have a better experience. Overall I'm satisfied with the food I've ordered from Obasan and I will continue to go there.My experience at Obasan has been limited to call-in takeout, so I can't say too much on the wait time or service; however, the times I have gone I have enjoyed the nabeyaki udon and spicy tuna roll.It's really good to know that I have Obasan to fall on for Japanese food for lunch. Their Tempura is absolutely wonderful. &#160;The &#160;Teriyaki &#160;Chicken is pretty good as well was the &#160;Teriyaki &#160;Salmon. &#160;I haven't tried the Sushi except what comes in the bento box and that is always great! &#160; &#160;I value a consistent dinning experience and they have provided that. &#160;I will up the stars once I have tried some more dishes. &#160;The service is always with a smile! Suuuushay! &#160;I've been here 3 or 4 times now and everything is always good. Granted I don't often stray from sushi, sashimi, &amp; nigiri, so I can't comment on the other Japanese dishes. The fish itself is always super fresh, the presentation is beautiful, and the servers are very sweet. Obasan is small and faintly decorated, but it's done well. It's inviting, even though they play anime on a tv in the back....on mute so w/e I guess. I will be back!oh.... Obasan = grandmother (apparently) in Japanese. Do you feel smarter now? I've had my eye on Obasan since they opened, and finally decided to grub there for lunch.One clarification, looks like they have certain hours for lunch. I forgot to check the exact days, but they serve lunch from 11a - 2:30p on Saturdays (might actually be every day they're open). I walked in at exactly 2:30, and almost didn't get seated. The host was cool though, and said I could have lunch anyway. He even let some other guy sit down, who walked in 10 minutes after me. Beyond that, he had to tell other walk-in customers that the kitchen was closed.Anyway, on to lunch.Their sushi selection looked good, but I wanted something warm to eat given the freezing ass weather, so I went for the yakiniku beef bowl. Their yakiniku is a cross between bulgogi and gyudon, more like the former. The portion is just right for lunch; it looks deceivingly small, but I walked out of there needing a disco nap. The beef was really tasty and tender, offering a subtle sweet flavor which is typical for this type of Japanese fare. I was caught off guard by the white mushrooms and broccoli incorporated into the dish. I'm sure those are used to add variety, but it seemed odd to me (though not enough to detract the overall flavor).Outside of lunch, the service is really good. The host was very attentive, and provided fairly textbook service (albeit, he was really timid). Between ordering and turning around with my food, it took a reasonable amount of time, and wasn't long until I was getting my grub on. I guess my lunch meal came with soup; the host forgot to bring that out, and promptly offered a free soda to make up for it. I thanked him for the offer, but declined. He ended up taking 10% off my check for the minor inconvenience, and I hooked up a good tip in return.So I'm giving them three stars as an overall score. I walked away satisfied for lunch, but not exactly with my mind blown. To be fair, I have to come back and try their other dishes. Perhaps a better taste of the menu will earn another star. Also, the pricing is above average, but considering the location, it's to be expected. I say give em a try if you haven't already, I shall return to give the rest of their menu a go. I love this place!! The woman who works there is so smiley and sweet and the roles are so delicious! I love the dragon roll it's my favorite...I always get sake and miso and a few rolls and it is inexpensive...... This place has some great fish. &#160;We ordered some mackerel and white fish nigiri and they were so fresh and generously sized. Some of the best fish I've had at any sushi restaurant in the county.The rolls are good, too, although not as spectacular as the nigiri. The wait staff is friendly as well. The only thing holding this place back is marketing. When we go the place is usually not very packed. I personally like to dine around other people, but hopefully with time, Obasan will draw bigger crowds.Pic of what we had: http://ling.swingvine.co&#8230; This is my new favorite restaurant. &#160;Every time we go the staff is always so cheerful, polite and usually remembers us. &#160;Regardless of how busy or how slow business is they are attentive but never walk over when I have my mouthful. &#160;Plus When I order Agadashi Tofu with no flakes she giggles and shakes her head which is charming not annoying. &#160;Speaking of...the food. &#160;It is always so perfect. &#160;The rolls are huge and often so pretty I dont even want to eat them. &#160;Alas I always do and they are delicious! &#160;I real enjoy their use of spicy sauces on several of the rolls. &#160;I usually get the tempura entree or bento. &#160;Big fan of tempura and love that it is a healthy mix of shrimp and veggies. &#160;Most of the time you either get one or the other. &#160;I also love the little salad it comes with. &#160;Its washed. &#160;Imagine that - washed salad! &#160;Most places it comes straight from a bag. &#160;Blech! &#160;My favorite by far is the Agadashi Tofu. &#160;Its always my favorite at any sushi place but this one its the best. &#160;A healthy portion for a reasonable price and the best I have ever had. &#160;Its served piping hot with lots of broth (my favorite part) and if you like the fish flakes, lots of those on top. &#160;I think it is supposed to be shared but whenever I get it I eat it all and pass my miso on to my husband. &#160;This restaurant is the reason I signed up with yelp. &#160;I just had to share. &#160;I greatly hope they stay around a long time. &#160;Otherwise I will have to learn how to make my own agadashi tofu. Great sushi, great service, great prices. I have been here half a dozen times, and keep coming back for more. &#160;The spicy salmon hand roll special for 99 cents is the best deal in Seattle (one per customer, dine in only). &#160;The salmon is tasty, the spicy sauce has little or no mayo, and the nori is always crisp.The bento boxes are large and the selection is varied. &#160;I like the fact they don't fill up one of the big spaces with rice. &#160;There is a generous amount of crispy, light tempura.The rolls are very generously sized and interesting. &#160;I like the Obasan special veggie roll (which has about 7 different vegetables in it) as well as many of their salmon-based rolls.The tea is genmai cha, green tea with roasted brown rice. &#160;Very nice. &#160;The one miss I've experienced is the green tea mochi ice cream. &#160;Don't know where they get it, but the mochi was way too mushy and the flavor was bland.Every time I have gone the service has been outstanding. &#160;Granted, I only go during weeknights so it has never been crowded. &#160;I also have never been there for lunch. &#160;This is a great, everyday, go-to sushi place, but please don't go expecting one of those rarefied sushi experiences with dozens of types of fish and complicated dishes a la Shiro or Nishino. &#160;Not that kind of place; certainly not those kinds of prices!A very welcome addition to lower Queen Anne. Tried it for the $1 sushi during happy hour. That part was pretty good, wasn't a huge fan of the rolls though. Sake was cheap too. I was surprised when we got the bill - not expensive, but more than i would have expected. But then I was full until about noon (i usually eat every couple hours) the next day so I got over it. Special rice?Again, didn't love the rolls, and I like both sushi and rolls so that takes it down a notch for me. Almost would give it 3.5?Not sure if I would go back. It was good, but kind of out of the way for me. And not strong enough to draw me. I was so stoked when they put up the sign for this place where the Ritz Camera used to be. &#160;There are a zillion Thai restaurants in this neighborhood but good Japanese pickings are slim. &#160;The service is excellent - our first visit shortly after it opened we received a free appetizer. &#160;The sushi is pretty good, fresh, rolls are well seasoned with good flavor combinations. &#160;The decor is quite nice - a good sleek, modern design. &#160;We've never needed to wait for a table - it always seems like there is just one or two left waiting for us. &#160;All-in-all a great neighborhood place to go when I don't feel like making dinner. Overall a very good place to get sushi. The sushi itself is pretty good quality, it beats most of the places I've been to. There was one time where one piece of fish was very slightly sour, however the rest of the roll was fine and this was a singular incident; one out of several visits so maybe it was a fluke. Generally the food's always been very good.I personally like the atmosphere. I love the color of the interior, stepping into the place you definitely feel a transition of environment. It's sparse, which I like, but comfortable. Once, we ordered a small bottle of sake, the quality was very good and they served it with little wooden boxes as cups, which you then get to keep. Pretty cool. They have unfiltered sake which is very much a plus. They do show anime on a tv in back, but I don't see that as a problem, really. Once they were showing a James Bond movie (+) but it had Roger Moore instead of Sean Connery (-) not really relevant, though.The service here is excellent, we usually get the same server and she's extremely kind and attentive, very friendly and it's very much appreciated.My only gripe is the selection of sushi rolls. There are two or three basic rolls on the menu, but the rest are what I call novelty rolls. Each is named after a city, sort of neat really, but they all have too many ingredients. There's bound to be something you don't want included in the roll. It's my understanding that Japanese food is usually pretty simple, yet elegant. So these particular rolls seem like Americanized versions of sushi trying to too hard to appeal to everybody. I like the taste of seaweed, that's why I like rolls vs. nigiri sometimes, but there are too many flavors competing with each other here, drowning out the seaweed. Each roll has stuff on the inside, of course, but then has extra fish glommed onto the outside, it's just too much. On the upside it does give you more food for your money, the rolls are pretty big, but I'd rather they had more options where they keep it simple : fish, rice, seaweed. All you need. It's not a huge drawback, the quality is still good, it's just a matter of preference.All in all I highly recommend Obasan, it's a cool place for two people to go to have some great sushi and drink unfiltered sake out of little wooden boxes while watching the campy-but-not-coolest-of-all Bonds. Wow! I was duly impressed by this place. It's nice and clean inside. No sushi bar, but the fish was plentiful, exceedingly fresh, and flavorful. The rice had just the right amount of mirin. The rolls were creative but not gaudy, and Mei (sp?), our waitress, was super sweet, welcoming, informative, and friendly. I will most definitely be back, and I can recommend this place to anyone and everyone. The prices are very reasonable, and, again, the fish is fresh and the portions are plentiful. I'd love to try the bento as well soon. I think I will! Good sushi in a convenient locations. This sushi place is new to the neighborhood. The aged isn't too fishy (like some places) while the Goya's are fresh and steamed. There is a nice selection of rolls - many leaning towards the spicy end. The even have a "Mexican" roll that they warn is extra, extra spicy. The staff is very friendly and the decor modern and lovely. It looks like they only have one highchair so you might want to call ahead if you need one to make sure it's available. They were very child friendly, being careful to put hot beverages and food out of our toddler's reach. They also didn't bat an eye at the ever growing pile around the bottom of her chair. Overall, a nice experience. What great value and quality for lunch! I didn't expect from a $7 Katsu lunch to get 2 lean, crispy pork cutlets, a salad of fresh spring greens (not chopped cabbage with Kewpie), miso soup, and enough rice for a small family. The one disappointment came in the form of a lackluster $9 Udon noodle dish with 1 lonely tempura shrimp, which I munched while staring at a $9 bento box with 3 tempura shrimp, sushi, etc. I also agree with Lara on the friendly service and clean restaurant. Finally, I've found another dependable, good Japanese lunch option on lower Queen Anne! (You should never have to go to Sam's Sushi again.) For a few more bucks, I still think that Shiki is better.
This review is based on the bar experience only.They had killer margaritas, and a wide selection of tequila, me comin fom CALI, I was impressed. &#160;I order a shot of Porfidio Anejo and it was 19.00, I was astounded, 30.00 in Cali.The place was packed and someone had splashed me with a liquid, as if it were intentional, so I ws head huntin...to find out if it was the bartender spraying one of his friends, and got on me...FUCKER &#160;- 1 star. I know that you all may think I'm a total tool, but I like Pesos.No not because of all the hot pieces of ass surrounding you, but because it's got genuinely good food, awesome service (I heart you Greg) and good music.You can go there, get totally hammed on Saturday night, roll in on Sunday pick up your credit card and have some good grub to kill the hangover (hopefully with that rando you brought home the evening prior, but if not there's more!). I've come here for drinks and did not enjoy it -- too much of a meat market and it's hard to find seats.Brunch and lunch is another story. I love everything I've ate here, especially their chicken fried steak and crab &amp; avocado spring rolls. I love the cast iron (?) decor they have throughout the restaurant. Mostly here for the bar scene, but usually if I'm early I'll grab a few appetizers.Service = a bit slow, but understand could get dizzy myself with all the beautiful ppl here Ambiance = A bit more space would be nice for the restaurant portion, seems a bit tightFood = Anything is good, after a couple sapphire tonicCrowd = I love beautiful pplPrice = $$$Favorite = Eye candyWorst = a bit loud for conversationsFinal Say = go alone! I love the asparagus/crimini mushroom &amp; the garden scrambles, and often go to Pesos on the weekend to eat either one. &#160;So it was with this desire that I made plans to eat here this past weekend with friends.It was more than a little annoying that the hostess refused to seat me until my entire party (of 2 more) arrived, despite the fact that it wasn't busy, and the dining room was not even half full. &#160;There were probably at least ten empty tables, and no one was waiting for a table so I'm not sure how my being seated would effect anything. &#160;Oh, and being ignored for a full 20 minutes after I was finally allowed to be seated was also annoying. &#160; I'm not sure why Pesos' staff doesn't seem to think that a person should be waited on (as in, given water, asked if they would like a drink, etc) while they are waiting for the rest of their party to arrive. But the asparagus scramble was, as always, delicious. Peso's is the restaurant equivalent of a "butter face". From far away, you are intrigued by the BRIGHT YELLOW exterior, the hoards of beautiful people that are entering and exiting the doors, the smell of yummy mexican food that is wafting out of the windows, your favorite pop song that is being blasted onto the street.And then you get inside and you get a closer look. It's kind of dusty and grimy from the tequila that's been spilled on the floor. The people aren't quite as beautiful as you originally thought, and they are overly make-up'd and/or orange- you know, REAL butter-and butthis faces. The food, which looked delicious when the people next to you were being served, isn't actually all that fresh or appetizing when you look at it up close (read: moldy avocados and brown lettuce). But, all that aside, I secretly love Pesos. Why? Well, it's bright yellow! Points for bright tacky colors. I like to wear 'em, I like to be in places sport them.I had a shockingly-super-fantastic NYE 2006 here! Our idea behind choosing this venue? Come up with a low-stress plan that would make for a good story. We found ourselves sitting at the long tall table and taking tequila shots all night long. We felt so bad for our stressed-out server that we started buying her shots too, which she took while crouching under the table. An excellent time was had by all. The food is definitely edible and especially after a couple of super strong drinks. I recommend eating it after the sun has gone down. But here's a question: what is with that super narrow hallway to the women's bathroom? It's like, two feet wide! A super-large person might get stuck... they should really think about widening the lane. I came here after the Elite event. &#160;I hadn't been before, but was curious about the scene.The lowdown: &#160;Thursdays are a good night. &#160;The rumored douche bag crowd was nowhere to be seen. &#160;I was only there until about 10:30 or so, but the crowd seemed, uh, cool, I guess (that's the opposite of douchey, right?). &#160;It was crowded as all get out and the bouncer wouldn't let Prema in because she didn't have her ID. &#160;What's up with that?*The only thing I ate were their chips. &#160;They were damn good and hot chips. &#160;Their salsa was perfect. &#160;I ate a lot, yet for some strange reason I was still hungry. &#160;When I visit again, I will update the stars based on the food and the atmosphere. &#160;It's A-OK in my book.*Don't tell anyone, but Prema is really only 19!! &#160;Damn, those bouncers are good. This establishment came highly recommended for brunch. Since I had eaten dinner here and enjoyed it in the past, I thought I'd check out the early morning fare.I arrived right at 9am, which is when they open. Too bad they open so late in the morning; I'd go there more often if they opened earlier. I think other people would as well since Peso's had people waiting outside well before the doors opened. Before I go on, I'll summarize by saying the food is great, but the service is sub-par. In fact, I believe it is the service here that will keep this little restaurant forever as good, but not great. But now I digress.I was seated right away, even though my friend was a little late. I appreciated that. But it would have been nice to be greeted at my table at some point by a waitress, perhaps offering me a morning beverage. My friend arrived 10 minutes later. When she sat down, I was THEN confronted by a cute strawberry redhead waitress who wanted our order. We hadn't even looked at the menu! I ordered a grapefruit juice, and asked for a little more time to peruse the options. &#160;When my grapefruit juice arrives, at a whopping $3.95 a pint! it was FULL OF ICE. I think you could have dripped about 2 ounces of juice out of that $4 cup. What a rip off!To navigate the ice I asked for a straw from three different people. I never did see that straw. I ended up SUCKING the juice from around all that ice. That really p'd me off. But the food made up for it.I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak (apparently a Peso's "cult classic" dish). I'm from Texas, and chicken fried steak in the morning is easy for me. It was totally worth it too! It was soft as warm marshmallows but not soggy and had a nice spicy flavor to it. It's the food that will bring be back. My friend ordered the King Crab Eggs Benedict. She loved hers as well. The menu as a little confusing because they had two small notes on the bottom, something like "Eating raw food... blah blah blah" and "This item comes with xyz". The problem was that both notes had an asterisk to designate them on the rest of the menu. Then literally over 60% of all the items on the menu had the asterisk. I couldn't tell if it meant the dish came with XYZ items, or if it was raw. That was dumb of the designer. And since I'm on the menu design rant, let's just be clear: a hyphen should only be used for a minus sign. My final grade for Peso's BRUNCH (this is not for the rest of the day's service or menu) is a solid 3 out of 5. I think good service would have made it a 4, and GREAT food and GREAT service would have made it a 5. &#160;But it's only a 3 with really good food and bad service. The bad:-Holy crap, rudest male bartender everrr..completely out of nowhere! I dont care if you're having a bad day buddy, but don't take it out on me and my friend who you are supposed to be serving and continue to humiliate us by yelling at us for ordering a quesadilla at the bar (it wasn't crowded either) ?!?! Oh and then you feel bad about it and decide to comp our beer and quesadilla....oh but wait...15 min later you change your mind and have a server track us down at the bar and give us the bill?!?! F'ing Bipolar.-The patrons were really "fratty"The good:+the quesadilla was pretty good+ atmosphere was pretty good for Seattle I'm torn here. I love the food, it's amazing food. Wow, that's some good carne asada. Great breakfasts too.However, the servers are incompetent, slow and occasionally rude. Sorry ladies, this ain't Hooters--luscious lady bits don't make up for sucking at your jobs. When you have lots of menu items containing fish and spice I tend to like it. When you have good boozy drinks I tend to like it. When you have a great happy hour with good food and drink I tend to like it.What I don't like is beyond rude pompous servers. I also don't like small spaces, no parking, and beyond long wait times. When a server tells you what you are going to do- and moves your stuff as they are forcing it upon you- that is not cool! Last time I went I ordered something off the regular menu (which I thought was too pricey for what it was) and held my rage in, about the mistreatment of my friends and our group, by watching UFC over the shoulders of those in the bar watching. I do like the fish ceviche tostado- it is on the happy hour menu- $4&amp;$5 dollar bites The person who brought me here last Saturday night likes loud bars that are packed to the rafters with white 22 year olds. &#160;So really, I'm glad he enjoyed himself. &#160;I, however, got the willies the minute we stepped foot in this greek-row-branch-campus. &#160;I hate to be a snob so I agreed to stay -- this had to be communicated via crude sign language, btw. &#160;Did I mention it was unbearably loud? &#160;No? &#160;It was unbearably loud. Our server was really pissed at us for some reason. &#160;I had no clue why, so I just tried to be exceptionally polite to her all night. &#160;In reading other reviews I realize it's the requisite staff demeanor. &#160;Delightful. &#160;We had phenomenal chips, salsa, asparagus, and drinks, but great food does not a great bar make. &#160;I will say that watching the mating behaviors of the overly tanned was fascinating. &#160;But yeah, I'll never go back. &#160;Pesos was not my particular cup of tea. &#160;Clearly they will survive without me. taste. &#160;some people have good taste some people have bad taste but we all have different tastes. &#160;Well, my taste buds were not crazy about pesos. (i'm sorry heidi!) and it's because the food tasted like it was haphazardly put together. &#160;the only way i can describe it is that it tasted... muffled. &#160;although my chicken quesadilla was good and the crab cake was delicious, it wasn't... amazing. &#160;it tasted something i can put together at home. the ambiance was nice though. The consistent theme of the southwest was a good. &#160;and the crowd was... well. let's just say i know where all the gold diggers go. &#160;but interestingly enough, i didn't see any guys approach these young ladies. &#160;hmm.. very seattly. I can recall the time I came here with my roommate and two friends. We got him to chase some oxycotin (he was legitimately in pain btw, UWMC just didn't give him STRONG enough meds) with tequila, spin him around and watch him go. I think he hit on a girl that wasn't quite 19 but it was a great time had by all.I also thoroughly enjoyed the night I came out here with some friends after this dick bailed out of my holiday party. They were there to keep the tequila flowing and hold my hair whilst puking on E. Roy.Pesos was also there for me when I lost my job in Aug. of '06. The following morning I walked up the street, ordered some huevos followed by bloody marys. I attempted to job search but all I wanted to do was drink.A big plus about this place is the late night menu--i hope they still have it, it's been a while! Excellent when the craving for mexican beyond Taco Time kicks in (and of course after TT closes).And as always, after you've had enough to drink be sure to crank the cyclist on the wrought iron decor outside. Wearing the same clothes you had on the night before? Longing for a Bloody Mary to dull the ache in your head? &#160;Then you've come to the right place!Highly recommended: the huevos rancheros (or Peso's version thereof) I miss their AVOCADO EGGS BENEDICT so hardcore.This is not my ideal bar or my ideal restaurant, but it is *awesome* for breakfast, especially if you can make it during the weekday morning happy hour. &#160;You'll &#160;get a huge plate of yummy pretend Mexican food for like $6, which leaves enough room in your wallet to spring for a glass of RED SANGRIA. &#160;You'll be partying at 9am and your stomach will thank you.I think the servers are mostly there to serve their own drama, not to serve you, so go with a friend(s) you can have a conversation with. Go there any night of the week to observe a potentially cheesy crowd (I love people watching), or to listen to the greatest music selection in Seattle. Go there for happy hour because its the best around. Try their margaritas because they are good. Come back (hung over) the next morning for breakfast. The crab/corn eggs Benedict is a must-have. Wash it down with a bloody Maria or Mary with their house infused pepper vodka. Its a great hang-out that has great food. Having recently moved to the Queen Anne area and after driving by this restaurant daily for 2 months, I decided to try it. &#160;After finishing my meal the first words out of my mouth: "well I got that out of my system; I will probably never go back." &#160;I have to say the only food item that was okay were the chips and salsa. &#160;The service was a little slow. &#160;The squash soup I ordered was basically horrible. &#160;My dish, pork carnitas, were middle of the road and the black beans and rice were devoured by my friend. &#160;I think that my reason for not wanting to go back isn't because food taste or service for that matter. &#160;It's mostly because I'm trying to figure out why this restaurant is soooooo the place to be and why it attracts GQ-Beautiful People Yuppie crowd. &#160;Let's face it, the parking in Lower Queen Anne sucks and the place is overrun with bums. &#160;For me to return to a restaurant there needs to be a knock your socks off/quasi-spiritual experience. &#160;Pesos does not give me that experience. BEST EGGS BENEDICT IVE EVER HAD!and im really big on the EB. i love EB. so for me to say that i think it means alot.the chips and salsa aint no thang really. its just chips and salsa. its nice of them to give it to you, especially at 10:30am but ive had better chips and salsa.one thing though, it did take a while for us to get our drinks. and i have heard multiple people say, not just from reading this on yelp but friends have said, the bartender is rude. so maybe hes just incompetent.ha just kidding.but i thought service (besides drinks) was good. one time we were seated and waiting for 3 other people and the waitress let us sit there for an hour. she didnt really seem annoyed or anything. if i was the server i know i would have been. but she seemed cool about it.im only giving this a 4 because of the eggs benedict. the sauce is HELLAAAAAA GOOOOOOOOOD!!!!! We were in Seattle visiting, staying at a hotel by the Seattle center and walked up to Queen Anne one evening to find a place to eat. What some people have said about Pesos being a meat market at night is SOOOO true. I had no inclination to go in there after I saw the crowd of superficial yuppie types but after looking at the extensive breakfast menu, we decided to come back for the $6 Mon-Fri brunch.We were so glad we did! I had the Eggsadilla and my husband had the Carne Asada with eggs and both were absolutely great. You get a lot of food for $6 and the quality is really good. I admit my expectations were extremely low for mexican style breakfast in Seattle but both of our dishes had that little bit of spicy kick we love in our food (we both hail from the Southwest). The service was efficient if not overly friendly and the coffee was good. The atmosphere is a little strange; sort of a kitschy attempt at old mexico with some Tim Burton-esque iron light fixtures thrown in for good measure. But don't go there for the decor - go there for the food! Been here a couple times for breakfast and lunch. Breakfast if yummay! I like the atmosphere and location- parking isn't too bad...We usually sit at the bar though...we don't feel right sitting anywhere else! Always a good spot for Mexian and a Screwdriver! What is up with the lines outside of bars in Seattle??I've noticed a trend lately where Seattle bar-owners are creating some sort of demand for their venues by forcing customers to wait in line to get in, when the bar or restaurant is practically empty inside. &#160;I've passed bouncers looking ominously at long, long lines, only to get to the window and see no one inside. &#160;I had a similar experience at Peso's last night. &#160;Against my better judgment I returned to this restaurant where I have been ignored by the wait staff, where the food is mediocre at best, and the crowd seems to be a mix of thirty-somethings searching for their college days like they lost them behind the sofa. &#160;It seemed like Pesos was going to redeem themselves this time, however. &#160;Our waitress was nice and the tortilla soup was tasty. &#160;However, when I tried to run outside to grab something from my car, the "bouncer" informed me if I left I would have to WAIT IN LINE TO GET BACK IN. &#160;In the middle of my dinner?? &#160;Seattle, if you are going to be pretentious like Boston or New York, get a clue and figure out how to do it right. &#160;The only saving grace I can find with &#160;this whole "waiting in line trend" is now I can immediately recognize what bars NOT to go into... i came for happy hour last friday and was pleasantly surprised that the place wasnt packed like it's been rumored to be. My friend and I scored a nice table by the window and were able to save seats for 4 more of us soon after. First of all, i've never seen a mexican HH menu so elaborate and dirt cheap. Everything looked delicious. I ordered a lot of random dishes including the crab spring roll, but what i loved the most was their nachos (with carne). My guy friends loved it so much too that they ordered another plate even AFTER &#160;happy hour ended. Can't wait to go back for more HH and eventually their famous brunch! Good for lunch, dinner or brunch but beware, this place can go from restaurant to 20-something drunken hetero meat market in the blink of an eye. This means expect to hear loud talking, yelling, whooping, and some general drunken bawdy mischief at times (read Friday and Saturday evenings). So if you want a quiet, romantic meal, avoid! The food is more Southwestern than Mexican but it's pretty good and the menu's lively. &#160;The drinks are good with the usual assortment of Margarita-esque cocktails that you would expect. &#160;The wait staff can also come across as hungover, especially on Sundays (I think it's real, not an attitude) but I don't need a server to fawn over me to justify a decent tip so I bring it up to notify those who expect some interaction. I have had a lot of love for Pesos in the past, but was there with some gal pals last night before a concert and they ended their happy hour early because they were 'too busy'. &#160;Now, isn't the whole point of a happy hour to make customers happy? &#160;And how exactly does stopping cheap drinks and cheap food in the middle of a previously happy 'happy hour' accomplish that? &#160;Lame, Pesos, very lame. I have been here a couple times, maybe I'm just new to Seattle but i thought it was some great Mexican food. &#160;They have a decent beer selection and a full bar. &#160;I was first turned on to them while visiting the Queen Anne area last summer. &#160;Me and my girlfriend had breakfast there, it was very good. &#160;I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a drink or just some good Mexican style food. &#160;Also the prices are pretty reasonable considering the amount of food you get and the quality. I know it'll sound like more of the same, but....Food: A-Price: B-Service: F-Seriously, ladies. &#160;I don't care how hot you think you are, it won't kill you to make eye contact, it won't kill you to set my plate down instead of non-chalantly tossing it at me. &#160;However, if there was suddenly a model agent nearby, by God, he'd 5-star this joint so fast your head would spin. Beautiful restaurant! Seriously. I am extremely impressed by the decor in here. Even the ladies room was pretty. The snake mosaic sinks in there are incredible. The food was not bad. Pretty standard I'd say. I noshed on the chips and salsa and followed them up with the chicken quesadilla. I can't complain about the flavors.. it's pretty hard to mess up a quesadilla... but nothing knocked my socks off. The folks I was dining with seemed to really enjoy their meals. One gal had the calamari and she said it was excellent.. and the same was said of the fried chicken and potatoes. Fried chicken at a mexican restaurant?? I did have a bite.. and it was good.We went here on a Thursday evening and it was busy as all hell. Judging from what I have been told and witnessed.. I think it is safe to say that this is not a low key romantic type place. It's loud and busy. But I would come back here and try something else on the menu. If for no other reason than to enjoy the eye candy that is this restaurant. Food and service is good. &#160;I've only been there for breakfast on Sunday mornings (well, they serve it until 2:30). &#160;I'm giving it four stars only because I don't like the crowd it draws. &#160;It's pretty much a sports bar, but I think most places in Queen Anne are. &#160;I guess I just like my peaceful Sunday mornings. Peso's is great for a swanky night out. Their appetizers are pretty amazing. And once you eat you can party it up in style. I hate having to move after I eat. Peso's is great for pigging out, waiting to digest and getting up to dance and get hit on. As pointed out by Erin, Peso's and I go wayyyyyyyyy back as well, and we were excited to have a couple pre-George drinks and 'chos before the show. Besides being thoroughly entertained by a man that had way too much botox and lip injections, I was very disappointed they ended their HH early because it was too busy. Fucking weak sauce Peso's. But thanks for the great people watching! First... the bad.I came for my birthday dinner on a Sat night and had a group of about 8 of us comming. Keep in mind this is a tiny restaurant and little did I know they were showing the UFC Affliction fight that night...Anyway, they were gracious enough to put a couple of tables together for us. Extremely great hostess! Two ladies in the party were running late and after an hour had gone by a totally RUDE waiter came up and said, "sorry but I need this table. It's Saturday night and we are busy." All the while I am thinking... I only see two groups of people waiting, I am sitting at the table you are about to take and I only need 2 more minutes and they will be here. I politely asked if we could wait for 2 more minutes since I knew they would be arriving soon. He said, "no" extremely rudely and literally snatched the table right out from under me taking half our waters and my purse with it. He then proceeded to take my things off the table and toss them on the bench seat next to me. Yeah ok thanks. I understand it was a Saturday night and they needed the table, but did he need to be rude? I think not.Second... THE GOOD!The food and booze here is great. I had the burrito with steak and the steak was so tender (which is not typical for steak in a burrito). When I was so stuffed I couldn't eat anymore, I tore through the burrito looking for extra steak, that's how good it was. The food also came very quickly for a group of 8 which was much appreciated. Everyone else's food looked great as well! The margaritas are BOOOOOOOOOZIE! I had the Bartenders Margarita and pretty much referred to it all night as tequila on ice. yummmm. Great for the price.If it weren't for the rude waiter... ha ha. We got to Peso's around 8-9pm and got a table pretty quickly. We drank until they closed and my buddy and I had a tab of like $46. That alone is enough for me to give it a good review, but there were also a ton of good looking women of whose conversation I availed myself. You could say it's crowded; I say it's popular for a reason. A rare treat for south west food lovers making it work in the northwest.! The nachos are a must-have! Great ambience. Updated 7/18/08- oh the conundrum that is Pesos. I love the food here at any time of day- my parents even like this place, for Pete's sake! But seriously, note to the Peso's staff: Get- Over-Your-Self. I went to grab a quick bite to eat just before happy hour started with some friends. The bar was packed but the dining room was 3/4 empty. The fourth person in our party was 10 minutes out, but the hostess would not seat us for the full priced dinner we intended on buying (despite happy hour nipping at our heels), because we were not all there. Her reason: "it's about to get crazy in here, and I can't seat incomplete parties" was the excuse. Cut to five minutes later, and the aforementioned "craziness" had still not ensued. The dining room was still almost completely empty. She then grudgingly agreed to seat us, but actually took away the fourth place setting from our table, even though she knew we were expecting a fourth. Nice passive aggressive move. &#160;Our friend walked in a second later, and we had to ask our hostess to please return the table setting she'd just taken away. She did us the great favor of doing so, but did so with a really annoying smirk on her face. &#160;Oh, and just for the record, the dining room was STILL quite empty when we paid our check and left. &#160;But, damn you Pesos.....the food was still really, really good. So, I can't really change my star rating......ARRRRGGGGGHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I absolutely love the brunch/breakfast food in this place, especially since they serve bereakfast happy hour prices. The Dungeness Crab Benedict is to die for as well as the Shrimp and Grits. I do not like Grits at all. Period. But the grits at this restaurant is different from that of Southern restaurants and I adored the Shrimp and Grits dish. The Carne Asada is divine and the Chicken Fried Steak is a definite must. I think that all of the spices and flavors that they use for cooking (Latin-spices fused with Northwest flare) is done perfectly here. Though I would actually only give this place 4.5 stars b/c the second time that I ate here for breakfast they did not serve the complementary chips and salsa. Oh and I love that you can order a carafe of their sangria early in the morning. We tried both flavors and it was heaven. So much heaven that I didn't get that headache drunk feeling that I usually get. I can't wait to come back here and try more... especially outside of breakfast/brunch.
Both Ways Cafe offers good food for those who are patient. If it weren't for their slow service and inattentiveness, I would give this place 4 stars.We ordered 2 coffees as soon as we sat down. The table hadn't been cleaned properly (some food crumbs and ketchup), so we requested *twice* (different ladies each time) for the table to be cleaned --- in vain. The coffee was good, but our cups were empty for most of the time we were there (refilled only once).We also ordered Havarti scramble with a biscuit, and a slice of pear and pecan bread. I was hoping for early arrival of the pear and pecan bread, but no such luck. As I was ready to start eating the jam on the table, the food finally came out!!The scramble came with some fruits and potatoes as well as the flakiest biscuit. I am a huge Havarti fan, so I really enjoyed the scrambles with lots of spinach and cheesy goodness. The potatoes were crispy and seasoned well, and the biscuit was warm, flaky, and delicious with the jam. The pear and pecan bread was moist and sweet with a nice kick from ginger.The quality of food was fantastic. The service was friendly but super slow (even though it was not that crowded...) I'd love to go back there, but not when I am starving! I can't wait to go back.Always searching for a place to go for breakfast after a fun run with the TEAM in Training group we stumbled upon Both Ways Cafe. &#160;The only thing I knew before suggesting it was it had good biscuits. &#160;Boy was that an understatment. &#160;Those biscuits are worth writing home about. They are huge and flakey. &#160;Whether you get the biscuits and gravy or just have a biscuit with their homemade jam, you will be smiling and thankful for having ordered one.In addition to the biscuits, the Cafe also has terrific egg dishes. &#160;I chose April's Special Omlette which included bacon (nice big squares) camelized onions and Gruy&#232;re served along side some of the best pan fried potatoes I've had in a long time. &#160;The plate was finished off with a simple but tastey garnish of strawberries and melons.
The pizza is pretty atrocious. Unfortunately the venue doesn't help the cause with the exception of the outdoor seating on a warm, sunny day.Most of their pizza is pre-made and when you order they heat in their oven prior to serving. Most pizza places do this so I wasn't to discouraged at this point but when I ordered my slices they were slightly cold. The crust was cardboard-like and sauce was nothing to write home about. Now for the venue, you can either eat outside if the weather is working in your favor, but otherwise there is ample seating in the back. Ample seating is normally a good thing, but unfortunately this area is in desperate need of a renovation. The carpet and walls smell like cigarette smoke from the 1970's which did not help the cause for the pizza. Looks like something out of the Gordon Ramsay show "Kitchen Nightmares."All in all, don't waste your time here. They probably get a lot of business due to their location, but if you can avoid it I would. My friend and I had just come from the late-night Underground Seattle tour next door, and we were looking for a quick bite to eat in a neighborhood where that seemed easier said than done at 10:30pm.I'll give Mario's credit in that the pizza was really, really good! &#160;We had the pepperoni pizza as well as the mushroom pizza, both of which were absolutely delicious. &#160;But, it's also the shadiest place I've ever eaten. &#160;You can't tell by the storefront, but the dining room (past the cashier) looks like a cross between one of those neglectful old folks' homes you see on 60 Minutes, one of those restaurants on Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares and somewhere where mafia deals would definitely go on.If this place could replace the old, dilapidated furniture with new seating, paint over the graffiti and do something about that funky smell, I'd give this place 5 stars. &#160;Like I said, the pizza is delicious, it was an inexpensive bite to eat and the service was friendly. &#160;But, as it stands now, Mario's is sketchy and creepy, and if I were going back I'd take my pizza to go for fear of getting shanked or knifed in the dining area.I also find it funny that there are no photos here on Yelp of Mario's purgatory-style dining area. I love marios pizza! It's soo good! The only downfall is that the seating area in the back smells like cigars. Gross. But grab a slice and go or sit on the patio! Yum. Mediocre pizza. Terrible customer service. A large disinterested man behind the counter banned me when I raised my eyebrows on the price of a soda refill. Unreasonably grumpy and a terrible way with customers. Better pizza and a much better experience available elsewhere.
I eat meat. &#160;I love to eat meat. &#160;Therefore, I have a tendency to stay far away from those establishments that serve up the chunks of molded and manufactured soy, dyed a variety of "natural" colors, and spiced with a plethora of flavors to give us something resembling the real thing. So, I was a bit hesitant when my mom and I decided to grab lunch at In the Bowl. I didn't step more than 3 feet into the place (we were seated at a perfect little table against the window right inside the door,) but from what I experienced, the restaurant was very quaint and comfortable. I was intrigued to see such an extensive menu and we decided to go with a couple curry bowls with fried tofu, wild rice, and Vietnamese Ice Coffee. Unfortunately, our order came back only half right. The coffees turned into ice teas, and one of the curry bowls turned into "fake beef!" Thank god for Mom's optimistic attitude. She decided she was fine with trying out the beefy soy (because I definitely wasn't about to eat it) and we both decided to make due with the ice teas. Even though we didn't get exactly what we wanted, everything was very good. My mom, who had previously sworn off Thai food about 40 years ago, finally broke her stance and fell in love this newly discovered cuisine of hers. For that, I am extremely thankful to In the Bowl. Now, there is one main detail about this place that stole my heart. Apparently, every meal comes with a dessert. Bonus! I decided to forgo asking what the dessert of the day was... thinking it was most likely sticky rice with mango. When our lunch plates were whisked away, we were presented with ramekins filled with black sticky rice and coconut milk. #@&amp;! Seriously, I've been searching high and low in the land of Southern California for any restaurant (Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese) that serves this bowl of deliciousness. And here I am, back in Seattle (which happens to be the exact same town where I first discovered this dish) and it's plopped down right in front of me, no request necessary. It made my day. I have been to this greatly random lil restaurant twice, but somehow forgot to write about it.. so here is my review about the second time which i remember more clearly.My friend and i shared the roti with yellow curry and spicy coconut milk noodles.First arrived was the Roti with Yellow Curry. After the first bite we both just about lost it. The flavours of the curry and the texture of the roti were amazing together and exploding with flavour. This was about two months ago and i STILL remember how it tasted and how i felt while eating it.Secondly our main course arrived (which i may add was big enough to split between the two of us). There were a ton of yummy veggies and the sauce was really great. Again many exploding flavours that just made you excited about how amazing food can be when cooked right and mixed with the right ingredients. They also have an assortment of fake meat that i haven't tried personally, but is a great option for other vegetarians out there. Greatly worth it and well priced. &#160;There is a nice vibe flowing throughout the place. About a year ago, I found this place on Yelp while wandering aimlessly around Capitol Hill.My friend and I decided to try our meals with "Shrimp" and were extremely turned off. "How did this place get such good reviews," we wondered. "This food is gross." We picked out our "Shrimp" and ate the veggies and wandered out, scratching our heads.About 4 months ago, I actually moved to Capitol Hill, and seeing how busy this place gets convinced me to give it another shot. Turns out it's just the "shrimp" I don't like. Chicken, Beef, Duck..thumbs up! I have been through most of the other (non shrimp) dishes since then and haven't found anything else objectionable. This is now the restaurant of choice when there is a vegetarian in the group and I want to make *everyone* (including meat-eaters) happy. Service is not great, but it's a small, casual place and they do what I need - take my order, bring my food, drop off my check. When I feel like grabbing a quick meal on my own, this is especially appreciated.Food is a little pricey - especially the appetizers - but everything tastes super fresh and the spices are just right, so I'm not complaining.Oh - also, they have interesting seasonal dishes. This past fall, there were a bunch of pumpkin dishes that have me drooling to think about.All-in-all, if you're thinking about going here, do it! Just don't say I didn't warn you about the shrimp... This place is very small, always crowded, a bit dirty, has no free parking outside, and is located in a slightly dumpy part of town.So why the five stars? &#160;The food! &#160;Best vegetarian place in town in my opinion. &#160;Worth it every single time. This is one of my top places! It's SO GOOD. I always get Tac Team with fried tofu in peanut sauce. They also have hands down the best vegetarian chicken nuggets I've ever had. AND THE MELTING CULTURE!! I have to admit that I don't like the free dessert they give out, but it's free so it doesn't really matter if I like it or not, right?It's best to get it for take-out or THEY DELIVER. That's right. You can sit at home and watch Teen Mom 2 and order In The Bowl for delivery. They also have specials/seasonal stuff that they post on their website, so be sure to check that out before placing an order!I would have to be put on suicide watch if this place ever closed down because I'm pretty sure I could make it over that stupid "big" fence they put over PART of the bridge on that one side. i call this one "ode to two stars:"yum yum yum so good tasty flavorful.oh, but it's temperature hot. steaming. must wait.no.yum yum yum so many tastes in one bite.OUCH.it's spicy spicy but yum yum yum.OUCH OUCH OUCH.i'm dying.yum yum yumOUCH OUCH OUCH.the eggplant is so amazing!OUCH OUCH OUCH. water.yum yum yum.more water oh wait don't drink it all i might need more.OUCH OUCH OUCH. yum yum yum. OUCH OUCH OUCH.please fill my wateryum yum yum. OUCH OUCH OUCH.thank you for filling my water!yum yum yum. OUCH OUCH OUCH.the noodles are so soft and soothing.OUCH OUCH OUCH. water.yum yum yum.more water oh wait don't drink it all i might need more.OUCH OUCH OUCH. yum yum yum. OUCH OUCH OUCH.please fill my water I love this place. My favorite things on the menu are the fresh veggie and herb rolls, the ginger noodles, and the spicy coconut milk noodles. Also, when you ask for five stars, they give you five stars. Not the 'foreign white person' five star.The space can be cramped - the food is pretty good here so there tend to be a lot of people during peak hours, but worth it once you start to eat. And when you finish your meal, you get a black rice dessert sweetened with corn and a little coconut milk. I always recommend this place to vegetarians and vegans, and even though I eat meat, I really enjoy it every time I come. Yum! One star removed for their crappy service, but you know, they're small and there were only two of them. The free dessert was unique and tasty and an unexpected bonus to my delicious meal. My date had a simple broccoli and "beef" dish. The sauce was too thick for my taste, but he enjoyed it immensely. Best part is when they ask you, 'what kind of fake meat would you like with that'. &#160;Cozy little place with good service and decent food given how cheap it is. So I went here on recommendation from a friend, on the vegetarian fare. &#160;I tried the tokyo noodles with "chicken", and found that it tasted good. &#160;I did ask for a 4-star spice level based on my standard choice, but their four star was too much for me. &#160;Certainly tasty.What takes away the two stars is the overall cramped space and a bad service. &#160;After bringing out my friends order with beef rather than shrimp as ordered, the waitress remarked "its all soy". &#160;Not knowing how to respond, we stared at her for a few seconds and then she replaced it quickly. &#160;When the replacement came, it looked like they picked out the beef and threw in some shrimp since we saw shreds of beef in the dish after that.I'll return for the food, but the similar service might drive me away for good. Ate here twice while I was visiting Seattle. Both times I was delighted by their ability to spice correctly. No white people spicing here! The meat analogs are great, even the "shrimp" was delicious! I'm referring all of my veg friends here, its that good! I just ordered delivery from here 5 minutes ago. It usually takes them 30 mins to get to my place. Not bad. Their food:Delish. Quick. Tofu. Easy. Yummy. Noodley. Spicy. Spicy. BEWARE: SPICY!! Their level 4 is not a 4, it's like an 'I'm going to make this so spicy you'll remember me for ever" type of level 4 spicy. More like a 4 to the 44th power. Stick to the level 2, you'll thank me later. I am not a vegetarian by any means, but the fake meat served here is almost as good or better than some real meats.I actually get cravings for In The Bowl at least once a month. I highly recommend their Garlic Mania Noodles.The space may be a little cramped but I can barely register that once I start eating. If you have any stigmas about vegetarian food, I promise you In The Bowl will throw them all out the window. I was pretty surprised at the amount of vegetarian/vegan friendly places in Seattle. &#160;My gf is full on vegan (and gluten free now) so eating out is usually a bit tough... &#160;Happy to say that in the bowl satisfied her veggie needs with my general tasty food requirements. &#160;We started with fresh rolls, and then I had the ginger noodles while she went with a coconut noodle dish. &#160;everything was awesome! &#160;Big portions so you're full, they bring on the spice like a good asian place should (only go for 5 star spicy if you're feeling bold). &#160;The free dessert has a pretty interesting texture, but its sweet, tasty and dairy free!One note, don't really come expecting crazy good service. &#160;The waitresses are nice enough, but efficiency is definitely the name of their game. &#160;They had our check and dessert out about 5 bites into the meal!I'll be back next time I'm in seattle for sure Loved the red curry. I'm a Vegetarian, I have been my whole life. Most vegetarian places in town will serve you vegetables cooked in grease and call it healthy, not here! The vegetables are abundant, the flavors are intense, the prices are perfect and its right next to where I live, what's there not to love? The food is so good it is worth cramming yourself into the tiny space. Tac team with peanut sauce, the duck noodle soup, and the grilled beef salad are my personal favorites. YUM. This place is good.As a lot of other Yelpers have attested, I am not vegetarian yet I will go to this place with no hesitation. Not that vegetarian cuisine is not good or not equal to restaurants that serve meat. It is just that I find vegetarian dishes need to be exceptionally well executed to have good flavor and heartiness, and it's difficult to pull off.In The Bowl pulls it off well. The dishes are, for the most part, really well seasoned and have great flavor. They have seasonal offerings where I have not ever ordered one that I did not like.The complimentary black rice pudding dessert is delicious. I wish I could order a gallon of it.They seemingly offer meat, however they are pseudo meats called seitan, made from wheat gluten. The flavors are somewhat resembling meat, but not completely on point. I really like the texture of these pseudo meats. They have a flavor of their own that is really tasty.Getting fried tofu with the dishes offered is also a good choice.In the Bowl gets 5 stars for take out.If it were based off of eating in, I would have given it a 4 star rating. A few reasons as to why:-hard to find parking-small restaurant-weak ventilation means you WILL smell like food-The stink eye you get for just stepping into the restaurant aka the service is not so friendly, even somewhat dismissive. I Loooove In The Bowl :)I'm not a vegetarian (anymore)...but pretty darn close, and the BF only eats seafood. We go to in the bowl at least once a month I'd say.All of the dishes are offered with a "meat" or tofu option, and your choice of rice or noodle type. My favorite combo is beef and wide rice noodles.Service and atmosphere leave a little to be desired...but nothing terrible. I think they are pretty interested in getting you in and out, as it's a pretty small place. Parking can be a little challenging at times too.The spicy scale is definitely hotter than normal. There are even signs posted saying so. I think it's 1-5 stars and a 1 is generally good for me. I like a tiny bit of heat, but still want to taste my food. My BF likes some heat and a 2 or 3 is usually good for him. Even a 3 star can get pretty hot...Just about every dish I've had at In The Bowl is great...curries, noodles, rice dishes...the veggies are always fresh and cooked to perfection. All the dishes are well priced and you also get free black rice pudding for dessert :) Vegan paradise! &#160;I go here for lunch about once a week, I am addicted to the pumpkin noodle soup. &#160;It is amazingly savory &amp; delicious. &#160;Everything I've had here has been awesome actually: lemongrass vegetables, super garlic noodle, green curry.... &#160;I'm not usually a fake meat person but... &#160;the "beef" is so tasty. &#160;You get a choice of about 6 false meats or tofu as well as many types of noodles (wide, skinny, tiny, bean thread...) Service is always super fast, prices are good &amp; the yummy little rice/corn dessert is an extra bonus. &#160;With so many options "episodes", you'll never get bored. &#160;And make sure to visit the bathroom, you'll imagine you've been transplanted to a southeast asian rainforest. &#160;:) This quirky little place is awesome. &#160;I'm not sure what it is about their soups - but they're so amazingly balanced, flavorful, and fun. Every time I eat here, I feel a little hint of doubt that their soup won't be as wonderful as it was the last time, but, I tell you, it always is. I don't know a lot about Asian soup, but I feel like I've ordered the same three soups in enough Thai restaurants to conclude that this is my favorite place to eat them. &#160;Was that a sentence that made any sense? Yummy!! Possibly the best vegetarian place I've ever been too, though the fact that I'm not vegetarian may disqualify me from making such a bold claim. &#160;This was the last place I ate in Seattle on my last trip there and was certainly the best. &#160;Shared the wontons with my friends and got the faux chicken fried rice...incredible. &#160;Service was pretty whatever but I wouldn't dare dock them a star for that because the food is that wonderful. &#160;I tried a little bit of everything that my friends got (pad thai, faux beef &amp; broccoli) and i would have been just as happy with those entrees than I was with my own. &#160;Wish they had thai like this in my neighborhood : / In The Bowl has held my heart (and tummy) for quite some time now. Living on the Hill has offered me a wide variety of food and bars yet I've searched for an awesome exclusively Veg food and here it lies! (It might be another story if Wayward Cafe was on the Hill.)Guaranteed to be busy on any week or weekend night. I rarely go in the restaurant nowadays because of this. I usually order to go or for delivery. They have great timing with delivery and always over estimate their arrival time. Their delivery drivers are friendly!The only little problem I have is the consistency of spicyness. I love spicy food but sometimes I just want to take a little break. When I've ordered 4 star in the past, it's not been spicy. There are times when I've ordered 2 start and it's been really spicy. I would like to see some consistency, I'd give it a five star then.I feel this is the best Veg food on the Hill! While other restaurants are tasty I find their attitudes a bit dismissive and "too" cool. I also feel that their prices are a bit high compared to In The Bowl. It's convenient for me and only have one complaint. My husband loves the Panang (beef or duck) and says it's very comparable to the real thing. So, if you know meat lovers, I would suggest taking them here. MY new favorite is the Pumpkin Curry. When I first heard about In The Bowl I knew I had to give it a try, especially since it was 2 blocks away from where I live. When I finally tried it I was glad I did because it was some of the best vegetarian Thai I've had.I've tried a few different things from here and all were great! They have a few different types of fake meat (chicken, beef, shrimp, duck) but I have only tried the 'chicken'. The flavors are great, the portions are big, and the prices are fair. I now come here almost once a week. I am definitely a fan! Gladly go back here. Had the delicious Angel Curry with fake beef. Besides the food, it has one of the coolest/cheesiest bathrooms I've ever seen. I want to copy it. I need to come here more often! The melting culture is on point! I just stopped in on a whim the other night and decided to try their curry and get a little appetizer with it, why not?! It was that sort of night. The melting culture sounded good and when I saw it I almost wanted to give it back. It looks like a mixture of chunky chicken vomit and a little basil! But it is thee most delicious thing. Served with deep fried little flour bites. OMG! I had a foodgasm. ;). For the entree... I tried both the red/green curry and the yellow curry. Both were bursting with flavor, creamy, spicy, and rich! I need more!!! Once you go 'in the bowl' it's hard to get out. No need to write a long, pretentious, review: this place has the best noodles within a mile radius for how much you spend. Oh and the rainforest is amazing - you'll understand when you have to go to the bathroom. Any vegetarian place that can make the hubby say he is full earns the stars! The roti with the melting culture was so yummy that I could just eat that.We ordered phad siew with "beef" and eggplant curry with fried tofu. I think we ordered it a bit too spicy or that their spicy scale is different from what I'm used to.In any case, it pretty easy to know we would definitely come back. We ordered yellow curry and cashew nut noodles. Both were yummy !!It's one of the best places to have vegan food. Taking off a start because there is a scope of improvement in service provided by waitress.We went in a group of five an everyone loved the food. Its more spicy than other restaurants . We ordered 4 starts and it was ok for us. We were in Seattle for work and fun. Wanted to eat vegeterian and so looked up on yelp. In the bowl had quite a lot good reviews so we decided to try this place. Amazing and delicious food, if u are looking for really spicy and tangy food this is the place, they also warn you about the spice levels so you can make your pick. One of the good places around! I love meat. Bacon, steak, cured meats, I'll gladly nom them up without a second thought. But I love In the Bowl's faux meat almost as much. I actually crave it on a semi-regular basis. Of course, it doesn't look, feel or taste like real meat, but it's delicious and I love it.Bonus: the place is a quick walk away from my apartment, so I always get takeout because the actual restaurant is quite small and cramped. Can't comment on their service, but my food is always ready quickly and on time, and it's not expensive. I've had several of their noodle dishes and just tried the duck noodle soup last night, and let me just tell you, everything they do is just delightful. The noodles are fresh and chewy, the vegetables are always perfectly cooked and the sauces/broth is spiced just right. A word of warning: I'm pretty sure their spice rating is actually a star ahead of other spice ratings, so order accordingly lest you scorch your taste buds off. I'm not even close to a vegetarian, but the folks at In the Bowl know how to cook, so they get a big thumbs up. Definitely one of my go-to places on the hill. The food here is really delish. The vegetarian and fake meat options drew me in, but it was the super hot, spicy chilling rice noodle that keeps me going back. Definitely a Seattle favorite. Meat substitute... WHAT? Seriously, I'm from Texas, beef is what's for dinner. But okay, I've kinda gotten away from red meat in my effort to eat healthier, and I have discovered Morning Star, but meat substitutes is still quite the foreign concept to me. So Mana, my vegetarian friend (yeah, we all have those), and I decided to grab dinner one evening. After an utter fail on my part a few nights prior to find appropriately vegetarian dish for her at one of my favorite restaurants, I decided to try yelp for a suggestion. In The Bowl pops up, I'm like, okay... let's see what this is all about. We get there and the menu has meat on it... I'm confused... I thought it was vegetarian place? A more careful reading shows that it's all meat subsitutes. Hmmm... okay. Mana is excited. Charlie... not so much. So we order a bunch of random stuff... "beef" pad see ew, "chicken" appitizer, "duck" curry... and you know what? It was freakin' awesome! I mean, it tasts so much like a dryer version of the real thing that I pretty much retained my like/dislike of each of the meat (eg I don't like real duck, &#160;and I don't like vegetarian duck). I loved the beef and I don't have to feel guilty about having it. Holy jackpot!Definitely coming back here if I am in the hood! Great Penang curry n nutty brown rice!!!.............fast service...... great for a take out Had the Panang Curry with "beef". &#160;So good! This place is awesome! &#160;I eat meat but their fake stuff is better than real thing. After trying their imitation beef I set out on a somewhat epic quest to find a similar product. I finally found something at one of the stores in the International District that was close enough. Anyway, back to In The Bowl, Yes, it's cramped, crowded and a little dirty, but the food is amazing. I've never had a bad dish there. And if you're one of those people that for some reason looks down at eating at a strictly vegetarian place....like one of my co workers said while I drug him here... you'll like it. He did! THE MOST INTERNATIONAL RESTAURANT IN SEATTLE -PAIR INSANELY COMPLEX &amp; SAVORY NOODLES / SOUPS with &#160;THE MOST BUSTLING EAT IN / TAKE OUT spot on CAPITOL HILL..WARM &amp; STEAMY &amp; FRAGRANT &amp; CHAOTIC...... NOTHING i can say will describe how comforting &amp; delicious this joint truly is. BE POLITE.. these folks are kind. Ok so, when you go, even though everything says "crab, beef, chicken" its NOT but you almost wouldn't notice.So I've been stuck on the Beef and Broccoli for a while now. Can't stop ordering that one. However, pretty much everything I've tasted here is delicious, the melting culture (Khao Tang Na Tang), full-filled your dreams (crab won-tons), the phad see-ew, finding angel (swimming rama)....I'm pretty sure if I lived within walking distance I would be there every night for dinner. I used to love In the Bowl...but that's before I really explored other vegetarian restaurants.Don't get me wrong, it's defiantly worth going to. &#160;Good location, quick service, variety of choices.BUT not only have they recently gone up on their prices (making it not worth it, especially with Wedgewood on the hill now), there's usually a line &#160;and you have to wait outside in the cold because the seating is so sparse and cramped. Had the coconut milk soup with mung bean noodles and tofu. VERY YUMMY. Would love to try their meat alternative meals, but they have WHEY (milk plasma)in the product. I don't do dairy or eggs. Bummer---but it's nice to know there are OTHER things on the menu I CAN have and so far....YUM YUM IN MY TUM TUM ;-) You know when something tastes so good that you eat to the point of explosion, and then somewhere in your body you find room to fit just one more bite because it's THAT delicious? And then when you get home you pray to the digestion gods that they aid in your quest to be able to eat your leftovers as soon as possible? That is the experience I just had with In The Bowl. Everything is vegan, everything is fresh, it is somewhere that I am sorry I didn't discover sooner, or rather they're sorry I didn't because I will be frequenting this place like nobody's business. It's tiny inside, and on this particular Friday night it was packed... I would imagine that to be the case most of the time. The friend that finally took me here told me that she orders take out ALL the time and they deliver too! Service was super efficient and prompt, the food came out super fast, and GOD in heaven if it wasn't just what the doctor ordered. The "melting culture" (I admit, not the most appetizing-sounding name) was INCREDIBLE. I have no idea what is in it, but it's a "dip" of sorts served with some sort of fried pita-ish bread. Then for dinner was the Yellow Curry Noodle Soup (I had to get noodles, the word is in the restaurant's name for goodness sake) which was fried tofu, a broth of coconut milk, yellow curry paste, herbs and spices, and cabbage, carrots, and potatoes with noodles - you choose from several noodle options. Also to note: apparently their spice rating system runs on the high side; I got a level 2 and my friend laughed at me for making crying faces a couple of times during our meal. Ok, I'm not only not vegetarian, I'm from a hunting family, meaning I have eaten a wide variety of animals and "fake meat" always tastes like crap. So when I went here with a vegetarian friend, at her insistence that it was great food, I wasn't expecting much. Instead, it was AMAZING. I've tried 4 dishes and every one has been fantastic - great flavor, fresh veggies, the fake meat is DELICIOUS (I've had the duck and beef, and friends have had the chicken - not sure whether to be impressed or creeped out by how authentic it looks and tastes?). Today I brought my Mom here for a quick meal and to let her try some decent Thai food (she has always had the stuff that's all orange, no matter what you order...) and she LOVED it. She even got some curry to go to have when she got home. Super affordable, delicious dessert, and they do delivery and take out as well. The only cons are the space is kind of small and you can tell they try to turn over the tables quickly, so it's not for a lounge-around type of dinner,but the food is so good that I'm ok with that. Highly recommend to carnivores and vegetarians alike! really like the food so tasty &#160;only service just little too fast to put the check on the table when you have few bites ,anyway &#160;I'll be back again
Not the fanciest or glitziest sushi place in town (heck, the name sounds more like a burger joint than a sushi joint), but one of the most dependable sushi places in town. The fish is always fresh and the service relatively quick. The menu is thorough but not too big (there's teriyaki and tempura and all that fun too, for non-raw-fish eaters). The special rolls are not very exotic, but we usually stick to the straightforward rolls and pieces which always go over well. In other words, don't expect this sushi to change your life, but it certainly won't do you any wrong. This place has a comfortable feel to it, and the service was really nice. The sushi was good, but very basic sushi, nothing over the top, but sometimes that is a good thing! =) Every time I've walked past this place it's always been packed. A GREAT SIGN!!So I treated my friend David and I to a nice sushi dinner. We were seated promptly, the atmosphere is nice, the service was lovely. Waitress came right over to see if there was anything that we needed or wanted.The food was perfection. The Sashimi is so tender it melts in your mouth. The Bento Box was delicious and the edemame was al dente. The follow up service that we received was excellent. I gladly paid $25 a head and tipped well. I recommend Sam's and I will be going back. I'm so glad I found such a great little gem so close to home.
This was our second year in a row celebrating New Years Eve at the Melting Pot. &#160;On this evening they have a special menu, it was a 5 course dinner. &#160;We started at 9PM and just finished before midnight, just in time to head out to the front of the building and watch the Space Needle Fireworks!We sat upstairs and they have smaller tables that are more intimate for couples, and we truly enjoyed that. &#160;Our dinner took about 3 hours, so this is not a place where you are rushed! &#160;We had 3 &#160;different fondue course, the first was the Swiss Cheese with breads and apples, &#160;we had a great time chatting and dipping and just enjoying ourselves. &#160;We had a salad course between the cheese and meat course and then on to the meat course, we had lobster tail, steak, lime prawns, chicken and veggies, they offer you several types of fondue types and we selected the court bouillon as our stock. &#160;everything was excellent and plentiful. &#160;We moved on to the final course and we chose the dark chocolate and raspberry variety, which was served with cheesecake, brownies, strawberries, both standard and coca marshmallows.By this course we were beyond full, you will not leave this place hungry.We do understand that on evenings like this they automatically include the gratuity, but this is a practice that I do not like. &#160;I'm not a stingy tipper, and I have a practice of giving over the norm, especially when service is excellent, and tonight it was definitely that! &#160;but when a restaurant imposes the gratuity on the bill, I have a more difficult time in tipping over what the restaurant deems as fair. &#160;I hope the servers can push for this practice to be eliminated It's concept dining. &#160;They have their own particular niche, and they do it pretty well. &#160;The service was nothing short of phenomenal; even when he found out we had a Livingsocial deal, he was very helpful and friendly. &#160;We did the 'classic swiss cheese' appetizer with bread, apples and veggies. &#160;The cheese wasn't as hot as I'd liked, but it never got cold and gooey towards the end. &#160;This can be a common problem when you get down to the last 25% of a pot with cheese. &#160;The entree looks like it's not that much food when it's raw and sitting on the plate, but we were absolutely full by the time we finished. &#160;I couldn't even eat the last few pieces of chicken and beef. &#160;The LS deal also included 2 glasses of champagne, which tasted fruity and delicious.I'm so glad I tried this restaurant out, I feel like I've been waiting years. &#160;However, that being said, I'm also never going back just because of the low value ratio. &#160;Even with LS, add on two cocktails and the upcharge for the cooking broth for the entree, it still ends up being at least $40 per person. &#160;If not for LS, it would've been at least $60-$75 for a decent meal. &#160;I'm sorry, but for fondue? &#160;There's WAY better value out there. &#160;Of course, if $$$ ain't no big thang and you're looking for a different dining experience, come here for some good food and exceptional service. Full disclosure...went there with a living social deal on a Thursday night. &#160;Will not be going back because: 1. We had to wait almost 30 minutes AFTER our reservation time of 8 pm &#160;to be seated, hostess seemed more concerned about her hair then the guests and we got the joy of watching another guest get ugly with her after he apparently had been waiting 30 plus minutes after his reservation time;2. &#160;Server although nice, wasn't attentive enough and even forgot to turn the burner on causing further delay in our meal and pretty much disappeared when we needed our check; 3. &#160;Food was "meh" - nothing special, nothing I can't make better at home, for example the salad was just okay with a mixture of spring greens with cheap iceberg lettuce, swimming in salad dressing; and 4. &#160;After I got home and realized I had chocolate stains on the back of my jeans... Note we didn't order chocolate fondue so it must have been on the seat of the booth. &#160;Nothing like sitting in a previous guests sloppy seconds to finish off an evening.The bummer thing is that I've been to Melting Pots in Florida &amp; Georgia and remember having good food &amp; a fun experience, so I &#160;was very disappointed with this location. &#160;The food just wasn't good and the customer service was really poor overall.I thought the idea of living social and groupons was to get new business in the door and wow them so that you will have future return business. &#160;That is definitely not what happened this time. You want me to pay you how much money to cook my own food? &#160;When I can buy twice as much stuff and do it myself for less than half the price? &#160;Great googly moogly, why am I even here?! &#160;Oh that's right, LivingSocial had a coupon for half off. &#160;Well, lesson learned.That's not to say this place is entirely bad. &#160;The ambience and the service were great, but with the food being as pedestrian as a school lunch and the portions enough to feed an ant, how they can justify the cost is mind boggling. &#160;Starting off with what was the highlight of the night, the artichoke cheese fondue was delicious. &#160;The following wedge salad was decent as well(anything with bacon is), but the main course of broth and meats were flavorless and unsatisfying. &#160;Though not included in the coupon deal, we had also opted for the flaming turtle dessert, which was a nice way to wind down the meal. &#160;After receiving the bill however, if not for the coupon, it would have been an unreasonable amount for what was at best a moderately enjoyable, albeit &#160;non-filling, meal. &#160; Go eat Korean BBQ. &#160;You're welcome.Food: 2/5D&#233;cor: 4/5Service: 4/5 TL;DR - Go for the experience, not the food. Really nice place for a romantic dinner for two! &#160;We went here on New Years Eve which had a limited (but very good) menu. Cooking your own food is good clean fun, and you won't leave here hungry :) I know this place is known for being a very romantic setting, but aside from the fireplace by the entrance, it didn't feel romantic to me at all ... I don't see anything appealing about a steaming pot of cheese all up in the middle of the table...LOLThe food here really is good...but do not come here if you are hungry AF. &#160;The process of cooking your entree is slow and frustrating, unless you are coming here just for the dessert...then you'll probably aiiiiiight.I give this place a solid 2 stars. &#160;It's fun to do the whole fondue experience, but I couldn't see myself coming back here again. I love fondue so I have always wanted to come here. To sum up my experience, not impressed and grossed out! The cheese fondue was yummy, with the bread, it also came with some still frozen vegetables and cut up apples... not too appetizing. The dinner, well we paid an additional $8 for some broth bc the guy told us himself that the meat and shrimp platter didn't have alot of flavor so he recommended it. It was still bunk, if I wanted to dip some meat into some bbq sauce, I could have stayed home instead of paid $100. Ok for the horrific part of the evening, I had to watch my mom pull out a long blonde hair from her salad. SO sick. we were grossed out after that.The staff is really nice, the girls at the front need to get it together, I mean they forgot all about us and we were sitting in their face. Sam, the bartender is the gem of the whole establishment.We will never ever ever and I mean ever be back.Food was not tasty, its super expensive , we were forgotten about and the $8 valet parking is still far from the door, and they park your car right in front of you but you still have to pay $8.Waste of time, waste of money and waste of calories.NO GO!! It's tucked away behind the street. I've eaten here a few times, and compared to the four other fondue places I've been to this location is just so-so. A really fun experience, and the staff here were very nice. A little pricey unless you're just getting the cheese and/or dessert fondues, neither of which is quite filling enough for a full dinner but both of which are very tasty. Also our drinks were good. I don't know that I would take kids younger than 10-ish; they'd probably burn themselves. Boo. First off the service was terrible. It was our first time here and we got zero explanation from our server as to how the menu was set up, suggestions, etc. We ordered wine and he got us the wrong. Oddly, the one he gave us was more expensive. Our oil for our entree was so hot it burned our food but we didn't know something was wrong until a different server told us he needed to switch I'm the oil out. He said he'd replace to good that got burned but never did. Our water and sodas were empty almost the entire time. It was only filled when we requested it. There is one stall in the men's washroom and one of the toilets in the women's washroom was practically overflowing. The appetizer and dessert was fine but the rest of it was not great. My girlfriend and I were there last night (Friday, Sep 28th) and had the worst dining experience ever. What is odd about this, though, is that neither of us is very uptight about fine dining and this is the first restaurant review I've ever written- that's how bad it was, it influenced a change in my internetting behavior. The service was awful despite the joint not being too busy, half the music selection was decent and the other half horrific, the fondue was so completely mediocre that I couldn't believe they have a VALET service (questionable priorities), the champagne was carbonated piss (again, we're totally not that picky so what the shit?!), and the salads/dressings were akin to those packaged in plastic trays at McDonald's.Please don't waste your money here as The Melting Pot has some serious revamping to do in their menu, practices, service quality, even their tableware as the plates were the stupidest serving mediums I've ever seen. I came here with my friend and we had the livingsocial deal (i would have to say that 75% of the people there had it). &#160;The food was pretty good (not amazing but above average) but the service here was HORRIBLE. &#160;We made reservations and when we arrived said we were going to be seated 10 minutes late so we went to the bar. &#160;Well, it ended up being 20 minutes after our reservation. &#160;We also waited at least 10-15 minutes between each course just sitting there waiting for the next one. We were supposed to get champagne and she didn't give it to us until we were done with our dinner course. We saw a couple who got there after us but ended up finishing way before us. &#160;Too bad gratuity was automatically billed because she would of gotten a horrible tip. &#160;The bartender was great though. He was very attentive considering he was new. OK....so I was pretty excited for some good fondue and for the price I was hoping to get something good. Granted I went there on a groupon I still think I the place was overpriced for what was served. &#160;First of all portions were small and the bread tasted like stale wonder bread. When we needed more cheese the waitress brought out a plastic bag to the table and poured in the pre-grated cheese to our fondue which, not to mention, kept going cold. &#160;The chocolate fondue was the best part but you could tell that the solid chocolate design was not completely melted before they brought it out.. Basically it was disappointing and the "magic" of fondue was ruined by multiple unprofessional incidences ( bread, cheese, cold fondue). The meal wasn't horrible but &#160;Melting pot Queen Anne could be better served to step up the classy factor. First off I want to say that this place is pricey. I got the four course meal. It was uber delicious. Everything from the salad to the fondues. :) I guess I'll only be going here for special occasions. It seems like it would pretty easy to make at home and a lot cheaper. Also my waiter was a lot of help and friendly. The first time I came here it was amazing!The place was full, the servers were friendly and helpful.But this time I used a living social deal and it seemed like everyone had given up on this place. We arrived a little early so the hostest had us sit down and no joke, the next three couples that came in after us had the living social deal as well and they were told to take a seat and their table would not be ready until closer to their reservation, which I found odd because the place was empty. The place was completely empty and I don't know if that was we because we came for dinner on a Tuesday night or if people are not as excited about fondue as they were in the 70s. We had an entire aisle to ourselves and it was weird. It was almost like they only had one server their helping every table (which could of just been 3-4). The cheese fondue was amazing! I could of skipped the meat and the salads and had a second cheese fondue. I will say even tho they have small portions, I was really full by the time I left. If I come back I think I'll stop by for happy hour and just sit in the bar and do a cheese and dessert fondue.Very pricy for the amount of food you get. They should have more deals during the week for dinner on slower nights like Monday to Thursdays because having the restaurant that empty is just sad. We used a Local Offers deal and it was great. The service was a bit slow at first but he made up for it with the complimentary chocolate dipped strawberries for our anniversary. I can't wait to go back just for dessert (we ran out of room!) Just came back from the Living Social deal and had a better-than-expected experience. &#160;The service was top notch on every level, the seating was on time (actually a bit early), and the food was quite tasty. &#160;I had read the recent reviews and was concerned...but my experience was nothing like what they listed. &#160;I would say this was a very good experience, with good food, ambiance, service and price. I purchased the Living Social deal that was offered at the Seattle Area Melting Pots and decided to use it as a final date night before the boyfriend deployed back to Afghanistan the next morning. I made reservations for 7:45pm on a Thursday night. We arrived around 7:15-7:20 and checked in. The hostess told us that we probably wouldn't be sat until our reservation time. No problem, we headed into the bar for a drink while we waited. And waited, and waited. 7:50pm rolled around and we asked the hostess when our table would be ready. She told us it would be another 10mintes. We ordered another drink and waited. Finally at 8:15 I asked again if our table was ready. She said it almost was. I went back to my seat at the bar and the bartender asked if we had a reservation. I said we did, and it was half an hour ago. He immediately went to the hostess and told her to seat us. I thanked him and we were seated and deciding on wine when our server came over. We ordered a bottle of wine, and when it was brought to us, the bartender was the one to approach the table with the bottle and not the server. He told us that he felt terrible that we had to wait so long, and so he wanted to buy our bottle of wine for the hassle. I told him that wasn't necessary, but very much appreciated. I was quite annoyed at their lack of customer service attentiveness prior, but once he showed his concern and paid for our bottle, my view completely changed. It is a nice gesture and excellent customer service. I wish more restaurants took this approach. Thank you Melting Pot for great fondue and wonderful employees like Charles! I came here for my 18th birthday with my boyfriend and my best friend. The first thing the hostess did when we walked in was ignore us for five minutes, and then finally asked if we had a reservation. It was a wednesday night, the place was completely empty, and it shouldn't have been a problem. We said no and she led us to a table that was apparently in the bar (even though I was wearing a humongous button announcing I had turned 18). We were soon kicked out and told we would have to wait an hour and a half for a table. So we went to go eat (because we only came to the melting pot for dessert) and returned and hour later. we waited for ANOTHER hour while listening to the hostesses talk about how their computer wasn't working. While we were waiting, three other couples came in (two with reservations) and were told they couldn't be accommodated because all of the tables were still full. On my trip to the bathroom, there were two couples at two different tables, and the rest of the place was empty. The hostesses continued to ignore me and and after waiting two and a half hours and sitting with people who HAD reservations, we left because of the incompetent staff. We went to Dilettante Cafe for ice cream instead. They were refusing to seat people because a new employee didn't know how to work the equipment, and behaved in a completely unprofessional manner. There is no excuse for leaving 9 people in a cramped waiting room because your computer doesn't work. You don't need a computer to run a restaurant. I will NEVER return to this place because of their entirely incompetent staff. Dined at the Bellevue Melting Pot restaurant using a LivingSocial voucher. The voucher was completely misleading. They restrict you to menu items that don't even exist on the menu. The entree has a variety of meats including red meats and they didn't disclose that in the voucher. Out of the 2 stoves on our table, only one worked and the server was unapologetic and even joked that they'll get it fixed after we leave. They charge 18% gratuity on the original price for what?? I recommend melting cheese at home and staying away from this fraud. We visited using a Groupon special. &#160;The experience of sharing and cooking food was great, and the Groupon dinner fondue and two salads was good. &#160;The Groupon came with two flutes of champagne. &#160;Our server asked if I'd like to have apple cider instead of the champagne and I agreed. &#160;When it came I realized it was Martinelli's sparkling apple juice, not hard cider! &#160;That was not acceptable. &#160;I was disappointed in the dessert fondue which we added and for which we paid extra ($16 or $18 for two people which I thought was overpriced). &#160;The dark chocolate was good, but the rice crispy squares tasted like it came out of the blue foil Kelloggs package, the cheesecake was ok, and pound cake squares were mediocre. &#160;There was too much cinnamon covering everything on the dessert plate. &#160;My husband and son enjoyed it which made me happy. &#160;However I thought it was overpriced in general, especially for the dessert fondue. &#160;I would only return if my seven year old requested it for his birthday, otherwise if it was my choice I'll stick to Chinese style fondue.
Delicious: DE-LI-CIOUS.That was basically all I could think about after what I'd eaten here. Asian Eggplant Satay---full of flavor and melts in your mouth... haha, that just reminded me of a bit from Candyman - Knockin' Boots:(plays tune in head)"...Understand I'm the CandymanAnd I melt in your mouth, not in your hands..."Mmm... My main was the Vegetarian Crepe. Now, I was hesitant at that because I've always thought, and had, "crepes" as a snack/dessert with fruit or whatever. This caught my glance, and after reading it, I suppose I was rather confident I would like it... since i did order it, afterall! ;) And it turned out, I really did enjoy it. The crepe is a different texture than I've ever had (i wonder if a fork would've been a better weapon of choice for it, instead of chopsticks), but it the crepe being tasty, and the veggie insides refreshingly complimented the whole thing.Despite review counts, I usually still ramble about decor and stuff, but i think i'll pass on this one. The 100,000+ words that make up the 300+ reviews of this place did a great job. There'll prolly be one at some point with a ridiculous # of reviews that i'll still ramble about, but that's for another time.I think we all enjoyed our pickings. Service was pleasant, despite perhaps a small ingredient error, but still nice, plenty of tea refills (haha L!) and a nice first experience for getting my feet weet in Little Saigon. R-e-c-o-m-m-e-n-d!(psst: it ain't that hard to find! Just head straight to the back retaining wall and head east to the corner) :P When speaking about the importance of the journey, not the destination, Don Williams must have had Tamarind Tree in mind. For it will be a consuming effort to find your way here. The restaurant is located in the back of a large strip mall with a wandering parking alley meandering along the side of a hill. As approximately fifty other businesses also use this parking, a place to stash your car is an Olympic level event. After fruitlessly trying to park in the maze for ten or fifteen minutes, I began to understand that this was more of a test: lessons that needed to be learned before being found "worthy" for the restaurant. So I watched the ebb and flow of people, considered parking algorithms and philosophy and eventually settled upon a course that netted me a spot another five minutes later. Success!Fortunately I arrived earlier than my friend and so I was able to let her know that it would be difficult parking when she pulled in. So she pulled around in her car and batted her eyelashes at a man standing in the lot.....who ran inside one of the businesses and dragged his friend out to move their car so that she could park. And she says to me: "That parking wasn't bad at all."And thus I discovered that the lesson the parking lot was trying to teach me is that life is not fair.During this escapade I was able to get in line for a seat as the restaurant was packed. We were able to get a spot by sharing a table with a pair of Amazon employees (after vowing not to disclose company secrets). The ambience inside is rather nice; far different than the chaos of the parking lot. It's muted lighting with dark brown and red hues and a small fireplace in the middle of the restaurant. The servers were quick to come by and we had the Goi cuon/spring rolls as appetizers. These were a little bland, but certainly reasonable for the genre. As a main course I tried the Bun tuit go nuong/chicken noodles. The noodles were fine although the skewered chicken was a bit of a challenge; it was a little difficult to free them from the stick. I found that the best way was to break the stick, chew it in your mouth and spit out the splinters on the middle of the table. This seemed to horrify my tablemates who did not appreciate the utility of this maneuver. A less socially stigmatizing way of doing this would be to use two forks to pull the chicken apart. A dining lesson learned.Overall the food was reasonable, somewhere between three and four star quality, with nice ambiance and service. Horrible parking makes this an overall three star experience and brings the final lesson: get someone else to drive you here. This is my go to place when I want to have good vietmanese food AND nice atmosphere. Don't get me wrong, I love small hole in the wall places, but sometimes a girl needs a little more...I've taken all of my out of towners here and they all love it. My go to items are the Banh Xeo, 7 courses of beef, any vermicelli bowl/platter, green mango salad, and the grilled casava or grilled banana cake for dessert, mmmm so good.One thing to keep in mind is that the parking situation blows. So be prepared to squeez your car into tiny places or walk a little ways. Tamarind Tree is another one of those rare little oasises that, once you've found it, it's been well worth the search. &#160;I think my friend and I drove around the block a good 15 minutes before we finally realized that Tamarind Tree is kind of hidden up in the back of the parking lot. &#160;Once inside however, they were well worth the search. &#160;Great modern decor with warm colors all around. &#160;We were there on a cold evening - however I'd be anxious to come back during the summer time and enjoy some of the outdoor seating that looked very inviting (on a warmer night of course)Drinks were great. Staff was... let's just say...enthusiastic. &#160;(I have a small suspicion that our server that night might have been a little *influenced* if you know what I mean. &#160;Either that, or he was just an extremely enthusiastic dude.) &#160;The menu was truly impressive. &#160;All sorts of dishes to choose from. &#160;So much so that I was a little intimidated and had to take recommendations from our exceptionally enthusiastic server. &#160;Kudos to him though - his pho selection for me was excellent.Another good mark for a spot like this: &#160;it was PACKED! &#160;Always a good sign. &#160;However, not so packed that they'd given away our reservation or anything.I really enjoyed my trip to Tamarind. &#160;Will definitely be back. Tamarind Tree celebrates its 5th year with a $5 lunch menu. A hidden gem in a strip mall that's the armpit of ID. It really is, however, Tamarind Tree is a far cry from its surroundings. A Cinderella amidst the ugly sisters. WHY GO THERE? &#160;I've dined here since its first year and it's always worth the drive to ID's Little Saigon. With melon walls punctuated by lime-colored lights, birch wood accent and a circular fireplace, the interior is upscale, modern Asian. It has exterior seating with waterfalls, perfect on a sunny day. And the food!! Everything I had were flavorful, aromatic, fresh and delicious. It doesn't hurt that they have a great cocktail selection.WHATCHA GOT? I heart rolls for appetizer (tamarind tree, spring and egg). The specialty dishes are awesome. I love braised catfish, pork/egg roll noodles, and the thang long fish. Yeah, that thang! The broken noodle with pork and shrimp cake is filling. The steamed rice paper rolls with pork is excellent. For dessert, I prefer the flan or the grilled banana cake over cassava. Desserts are on the sweet side so its worth splitting. This restaurant has a great menu selection I always forget they serve pho! But what the pho, right?YOU GOT SERVED. The service can be slow on busy evenings. Lunch on weekdays, it's perfect. There may be a wait , but if you got good company who cares. The waiters are prompt to bring water and tea to the table. They're polite when they hand the check. This is perfect for out of towners who want Vietnamese food. The first impression as you pull in the armpit mall is "yuck", then replaced by "yum" after dining. Finally found a Vietnamese town in Downtown Seattle!Tamarind Tree's in a real bad location but the outdoor/inside decorations are superb in comparison to any other Vietnamese restaurant i've been to. They had $5- 5th anniversary specials for some soups so I picked Lemongrass Sausage Congee which was VERY GOOD. The flaver of sausage wasn't overpowering the congee and i really liked it. Another one we had was the Beef Stew. My roommate usually makes it at home and she uses beef bone to thicken the soup.Therefore, for me, &#160;Tamarind's beef stew was too watery for me. It tasted right,though. Lastly we had Grilled Pork on rice. The rice was a little dry but really grilled pork was tender and well cooked. Customer service was great and liked the crowd since it was pretty diverse. What to say about one of the most reviewed Vietnamese restaurants in Seattle? Admittedly not my favorite place for fresh and cheap Vietnamese food (I'd recommend Huong Binh, Green Leaf, Moonlight Cafe, or any homecooked meal), this is definitely the place to bring newcomers to Vietnamese cuisine. This place is clean, well-decorated, with a sizable dining menu.Recently, Tamarind Tree has introduced a happy hour-esqe menu to their patrons. Between 10:00am-4:00pm daily, there is a (daily? weekly?) rotating menu of five dishes that customers can order for $5 each! This is a fantastic deal as portions are regular dining size and it's a steal from their normal $10-$14 per entree price. When I came here yesterday for the deal, the menu featured bun mang vit (duck bamboo noodle soup), hu tieu chay (vegetarian clear glass noodle soup), com tam (broken rice), bun thit nuong xao xa (vermicelli rice noodles with grilled pork and lemongrass), among others. I know pho has been featured in the past and no doubt other popular Vietnamese dishes will make an appearance too.I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here normally, but this special deal is such a steal that I had to share! The owner said he wasn't sure how long he'd be doing this, but it was implied that it'd be going on for at least a few months as a "thank you" gesture to all the customers. So stop by and grab a cheap meal when you can! Their 5 year anniversary = $5 lunch specials = awesome eatingI love finding affordable deals at an establishment with great service, clean/nice atmosphere, &amp; delicious food. Trifecta! Loved it - Loved it!Looks like parking can be a mess, we went on a weekday, and it was pretty packed - Definitely has become one of my favorite places to eat in the I.D. Need to try the famous seven-course beef! I was brought here by my cousin who's lived in Seattle for more than 5 years, and who has a great nose for food. This place was amazing -- everything we ordered was great (but loved the duck noodles, okra satay, and mango salad especially). Great decor and the staff was really friendly and accommodating, especially since we were a group of 6 with two small kids in tow.I'd definitely recommend this place as a way to impress a first date, celebrate a special occasion, or just get some pretty authentic Vietnamese food (this place gives Saigon a run for its money) while staying under budget. A nice experience, good food and service. Price can't be beat. &#160;We stayed conservative in our order (Chicken dish), might be more adventurous next time. I heard the full course dinner is really good too, want to give that a try sometime.It's set back off the main road, easy to miss. I don't think Tamarind really needs my review, they are obviously popular and live up to their reviews. &#160;So this is primarily for my own reference and if someone asks me for a recommendation for a Vietnamese restaurant. Recommendations:-Gi cun C&#226;y Me ~ Tamarind Tree rollsSalad roll with fresh herbs, fried tofu, roasted peanut, fresh coconut, jicama, and carrots served with vegetarian soy sauce.-B&#250;n mng vt ~ Duck noodlesVermicelli rice noodle with fresh and dried young bamboo shoots broth and tender duck served with shredded cabbage duck salad and ginger fish sauce.-c nhi tht ~ Stuffed escargot-Ground pork and shredded escargot wrapped around lemongrass stalk served with ginger sauce.-B&#242; l&#225; lt ~ Grilled la-lot beef rollBeef roll wrapped in la-lot leaves served with mixed herb and fresh pineapple anchovy sauce.lunch prices vary from dinner prices, reference their website for reservations and details of their menu. It's decent vietnamese food trying to please everyone but not excelling in anything really... except maybe for ambiance.I really can't justify giving Tamarind tree a 4 or 5 star. &#160;Having been raised in Irvine Ca and being 15 miles from Bolsa aka Little Saigon, I've had my shared of good vietnamese food. &#160;While Tamarind Tree has the ambiance working for them, the food in general is decent but nothing stellar. &#160;I've tried their bun bo hue and bun (kho, dry) dac biet and it was ok. &#160;The bun bo hue had way too much fried onions and the taste wasn't quite there. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad per se, but I expected more... especially after all the reviews, I guess I had higher expectations. &#160;I also tried the bun dac biet, which is vermicelli with combination of skewered grilled pork and chicken, deep fried egg rolls, grilled shrimp on sugarcane, and grilled prawns served with mixed herb fish sauce. The pork was ok, the chicken was dry, the shrimp on sugarcane was so so, and the grilled prawn had some flavor.The mango salad was ok... it was refreshing.The last thing that I tried also was their spring roll with grilled pork or also called goi cuon nem nuong. They use the old trick from Broddard (southern california) by rolling a lumpia skin and deep frying it and put it inside the spring roll (which makes the roll crunchy) and serve it with a typical peanut and hoisin sauce... nothing to rave about.The downside really is that it's expensive for vietnamese food which ... shouldn't be because vietnamese food is cheap in general... Because of the hype and the ambiance can Tamarind tree govern such high price otherwise it would never survive in areas where the vietnamese community is large, or maybe the food there is more catered to westerners?For each person be their own judge, but I'll default back to other places for vietnamese food. Whoa! this place is noisy, packed, and HOT. As in 100 degrees hot. All 13 of us were crowded around the "bride and groom" table on the stage, and were practically undressed by the time we left.But the food and incredible prices more than made up for our knocking elbows, excessive perspiration, and ringing ears. Everyone thought their dishes tasted very fresh, clean, and light. Typical of Vietnamese food, but even the fried stuff we ordered wasn't heavy or grease-laden. I had the B&#250;n ch H&#224; Ni (Ha Noi grilled pork noodles), which was a bowl of savory, porky deliciousness. The meat was perfectly grilled with not a smidgen of gristle or fat to speak of. The vermicelli was dressed nicely in a fishy, herby sauce, and the accompanying veggies added brightness and texture. Loved it. Sauvignon blanc paired well. It was a wonderful meal. Thumbs up for service and atmosphere as well.I'd be more than happy to come back and try more stuff on the menu. Curious to see how their pho fares and if their beef la-lot can hold a candle to Monsoon's. Would probably avoid going with a huge party again. All that body heat on top of the already sweltering temperature inside the restaurant may just be too much for me to handle a second time around. I prefer eating with my clothes on -- at least in public, that is :-) I'm not sure how I feel about Tamarind Tree. We went there Friday night, 7pm... without reservations. That was our bad. We finally got seated an hour later. We sat down at our table in the very far corner of the restaurant. When I looked around, all I could think of was chaos - tables close together, a shortage of waitstaff trying to zip through to serve table to table. At this point I had a feeling we'd be forgotten. About 10 minutes after being seated, they finally brought us a pot of tea. Then few minutes later our water stopped by to get our drink order - luckily while waiting for our waiter, we knew to go ahead and figure out our order. I got the lemongrass fried chicken, one friend got the short ribs, another friend got some chicken curry dish. -Service was a little slow, but I wasn't surprised after seeing what looked to me like chaos. -Food was ok. Nothing made me want to come back for more tomorrow, and no one wanted to pack up their leftovers. -Ambiance was nice, especially given the location its in. When you walk in, you feel like you're in some quiet, upscale-ish place and not in the back corner of a strip mall next to a few other restaurants and not to far from the dumpster of the neighboring grocery store. -Price was reasonable. Entrees for less than $10, coffee was a little expensive though ($3.50 for 1/2c of condensed milk and 1/2c of special Vietnamese coffee) When I lived in Seattle I used to eat here at least once a week. &#160;My GF and I started eating here before it got really popular. &#160;Now you can hardly get a table. &#160;They got popular for a reason! &#160;The food is the best vietnamese food anywhere, bar none. &#160;It's not a casual pho place. &#160;It's a nice, refined food place. &#160;My faves here are:-steamed baguette sandwich-tamarind tree rolls-vegetarian crepes-chicken/lemongrass salad thingy-the pho broth has such a delicate flavor, yummy:)I now live in the Bay Area and man do I miss this place! &#160;There is nothing here that compares to Tamarind Tree. I know this restaurant has been reviewed plenty of times, but after going to it I know why. &#160;Yes, it was a bit of a long wait but having one of their delicious mojitos (not too prciy) and satay appetizers made it worth it... their crepe was delicious as well as the garlic chicken dish... &#160;And the interior is beautiful, I love the fact that they try to separate the fairly close tables by putting natural plants. &#160;It really made me remember to not judge a book by its cover...the strange location and exterior of this restaruant really made me question where my friend was taking to me until I stepped into the oasis within... &#160;I can't wait to go back! OMG yum!This little gem is a true find. &#160;Unfortunately, everyone in Seattle seems to have already found it. &#160;Reservations are a good idea, but I've never had to wait long for seating even without one.Tucked away in an obscure location behind a little asian strip mall in the International District is one of the most delightful dining experiences in Seattle. &#160;Tamarind Tree takes Vietnamese to a whole other level.This place is gourmet in every sense of the word. &#160;The menu is extensive, varied, and delicious. &#160;They offer far more than any other Vietnamese restaurant I've ever encountered, and everything I've tried is wonderful. I'm a big fan of the Tamarind Tree rolls, and also enjoyed the clay pot dishes.The ambiance here is spectacular. &#160;This is a really beautiful space. &#160;The outdoor heated patio is especially charming, with a large waterfall and a garden feel (hard to believe you're basically in a strip-mall parking lot). &#160;The interior space is also lovely; very elegant asian aesthetic.The wait staff here are darling; very friendly, prompt, and enthusiastic. &#160;Every one that I've asked to share their favorite dish with me has done so happily, and I've not been disappointed.Great cocktails, too!All of this plus parking and reasonable prices = super yum! Good Vietnamese food that is trying to cater to everyone. &#160;Ambiance is nice (good for a first date I'd say) and decor modern. &#160;It's a little tricky to find the actual restaurant but once you get in you forget about the hassle it took to find it.The drinks are good (nothing too strong) and some are unique (chili martini anyone?) &#160;The service is also good, and the prices are reasonable though a bit more than i'm used to paying for Vietnamese food in Chinatown.Would I go back? Yes, Do I crave it to no end and think of the greatness while walking around during the day? No. &#160;FYI, Parking can get a little slim so be prepared to hunt a little but they actually have a parking lot which is rare in DT Seattle so I'm not going to complain. I would give it five stars but for the freaking noise! So loud. So so loud. Maybe 4.5 stars then? Yes. I'm comfortable with that. &#160;The cocktails are fabulous. I was very much looking forward to trying a couple, since it was Mommy and Daddy date night and all. I was not disappointed. Strong to boot. I do adore the ID; I like walking the streets, checking out the stores, hitting the eating establishments. When I stepped into the TT, however, I felt transported. That usually is a good thing. It somehow connotes a transcendent quality ... but that's not what I mean. Not that I mean it pejoratively either. Hm. Perhaps somewhere in the middle is where my meaning lies. The point being that it doesn't feel like you are in the ID anymore. The restaurant is really nice: calming, good for dates.... Bellevue nice. And yet. We were there on a Saturday night and the place was slammed! The bartender was in the weeds and looked frazzled. Our waiter kept running by, apologizing for the wait (there was none, really), and explaining that they were really busy. I usually find it irksome when waitstaff explain these sorts of things, but it was endearing coming from this guy, for some reason. The food came out way faster than I would have expected from such a hopping joint. I mean crazy fast. We ordered six different things and they were all awesome: nice flavors, great sauces, good quality ingredients. I loved the green mango salad and the stuffed squid, especially. So go there on date night, or with a few friends. Order drinks. Wear earplugs. And watch out for the resident panhandler who likes to follow groups out of the restaurant looking for alms. I was skeptical walking up to the restaurant, it being surrounded by rundown businesses and all but to my pleasant surprise... YUM. Great food for decent prices and the best service I've received at an Asian restaurant in a LONG time. All smiles all the way.Started with the Bon Bon salad: wasn't too excited about the bon bons (it was slightly bitter and, for lack of a better word, weird tasting) but the dressing was refreshing, the veggies were fresh and the portion was extremely generous.Moved onto the veggie egg roll vermicelli bowl. Again, an assortment of flavorful &amp; fresh recipes and the two egg rolls were delish (the shitake mushroom added the perfect amount of oomph to the fried goodness). The dressing (fish sauce) wasn't too pungent nor overwhelming, which I find that it is in other Vietnamese restaurants.I was also able to try the crispy prawns baguette, thanks to my friend who cares to share, and that too was a mouthful of deliciousness... I'm just happy that I was able to be gluttonous without feeling guilty about it. Without a doubt, I'll be back. Overall a great place. It looks shady from the outside, but once you're inside it's very modern. I enjoy the do it yourself wraps as well as the vermicelli bowls. It's more pricey than some other vietnamese restaurants, but the food is plentiful and presented nicely and it tastes good. It's been far too long since my last visit here, don't know why, but I just never think of coming here. What a mistake.I stopped in for lunch this week. They have this $5 lunch special going on. It was fantastic. Sweet,savory, fresh, flavors, my broken rice slection was delicious. It won't be long till the next meal here. This place is one of my faves in Seattle. It's really a nice place (love the patio area in the back), but not in a pretentious/snobby way, good service, ambience, and a solid menu with lots of variety of flavors. I forget what I ordered for drinks but they were pretty entertaining as well. One of those places where you can totally go to on a nice date night, but it's totally awesome if you go with a bunch of people &amp; have a blast~ good food, service isn't always the best. &#160;atmosphere is great, drinks are ok I have been here three times and there is no consistency. The first time, everything I had was amazing. The next was for lunch and it was good, but nothing special. The last visit, I have to say was way below par. The food was bland and over cooked. I was not impressed. The service is always good and the atmosphere is very nice. My wife loves this place, but to me; it's only OK. This is hidden gem. I have now worked in the ID for over 4 years and this is one that I will continue to return to far after I may leave. It's unlike most other ID spots. Though hidden in the midst of strips of shops, it boasts outdoor seating , full bar, and great food. I LOVE the fresh spring rolls. Tasty dipping sauce with a crunchy bite that makes them different that others I have had. Some of the dishes I have had are a bit unusual, but the prices are great, so there's room to experiment. Without repeating all the previous reviews... this place rocks. We ordered the 7 course beef plate for two. The portions were huge and tasty. My favorite is the beef with just enough char. This is a set menu, so just trust Tamarind Tree to do the right thing. The cocktails were excellent. I ordered the coconut martini and it was delicious. I highly recommend. Really bad location and hard to find cuz it's sorta in the behind of the plaza. &#160;There's no sign outside the plaza so I had to make 3 rounds around the streets to finally locate the exact spot. &#160;Also hard to look for parking when all the spaces are mark with different biz name meaning limited spaces. &#160;Very cute decorations, friendsly staff. &#160;Our waiter's extremely nice and helpful! &#160;I enjoy the process very much and the price is very affordable, about the same cost as a regular Vietnamese rest. &#160;If you are looking for authentic vietnamese food or some good pho I wouldn't recommend this place. I was suprised by Tamarind Tree's menu. Most my favorite dishes are on their menu. I really enjoy "bot chien" and "banh cuon" a lot, always have it every visit. Servers are professional, be right there when you need help though they looks busy. The food is quality, well display and serve fast too. The only drawback was not everything is fresh cooked. The grill meat I had last time was pre-cooked. It turn out hard and very difficult to chew after 5 minutes served. I wish they would grill fresh meat though I know it would take longer. I will come back and recommend all my friends to Tamarind Tree. My Vietnamese co-worker brought a group of us from the office here for a celebratory lunch and proceeded to bark at the workers here like they were here family. &#160;I am guessing this is the Vietnamese way? &#160;I have heard so many great things about this restaurant and finally got to try it out. &#160;We started with the grilled mushrooms and a couple of orders of the spring rolls. &#160;Both were delicious. &#160;I ordered the duck noodle soup off of their $5 lunch special menu. &#160; The soup came with &#160;a side plate of cabbage and pieces of duck that you dipped in the side sauce provided. &#160;The soup bowl contained a flavorful broth with rice noodles and some vegetables. &#160;There was so much food that I took over half of it home. &#160;Then for dessert we had the banana rice dish and the young coconut custard type dish. &#160;For the coconut dessert they empty out the young coconut water/cream and then cook it with some sort of gelatin or stabilizer and then poor it all back in the coconut shell where it solidifies in a fridge. &#160;When you scoop out the yummy goodness out of the middle there is cold coconut cream on the top with jelly coconut water below. &#160;Sooo good! &#160;Definitely order this to try something new. &#160;Well worth it. &#160;Everything my co-workers ordered looked great. &#160;I am going to have to order the rice pancake like dish next time because with the basil leaves and lettuce it looked delicious. &#160;For the quality and freshness of food the prices are right on. &#160;I can't wait to come back and try some other dishes. One of the best hidden treasure, literally. Such an unassuming location that will have you thinking "How have i not eat'n here before." Great atmosphere great food. The 7 courses of beef is a cant miss experience and the drinks are fufu and fan fukntastic! If they would just not over cook the beef this would be a 5 star. The prices are great too. This is the kind of place you go with 6 friends too and just order mass amounts of food and share and have a good time and when you split the tab you'll spend 25 bucks if even. Rave reviews from a foodie friend, we sat on a comfie cement flower fire. Delish fresh rolls of crunchy yummy chewy goodness. Mango green so good. Advised us mzungus against a vietcong favorite. &#160;That was possibly kind advice. We wanted to try the tantalizing array of drinks but had to punish them after a bad bad fake crepe/donut full of beansprouts and some gross mushrooms. Love the vodka chicken forever. Lackluster rice is inexcusable in a provincial viet restaurant. Nice atmosphere. My tip is to give some time to get your seat because it's always crowded no matter whether it's weekdays or weekend. I had chili lemongrass beef with noodle. And it was amazing. It's not spicy. Just like the regular Vietnamese sauce: sweet and tangy. The beef is tender and well marinated. This is definitely something that u should try. If u did. Let me know what u think. : )
My first pie was way greasy, but maybe they've changed their formula because I tried the Chicken Ranch last week and it was BETTER THAN PAGLIACHI. &#160;We had a bit of a snafu with our order being misplaced, resulting in a longer than normal wait, but the waitress apologized and knocked 20% off our bill, then threw in a complimentary crouton-salad or something that had capers and was confusingly delicious.They have an excellent play area and your kid can play trains while you wait for your meal to arrive. Apparently there are video games if that's your thing.Prices are on-par with the neighborhood, comparable to Pags, I believe. And that Chicken Ranch Pizza - the family size - was polished off over the course of 2 meals. That is saying a lot when our family consists of two grown people and a yearling.We'll be back. &#160;Tonight. Okay, this place has really grown on me. After a hiatus, we've been back about 3 times in the past 2 months. I don't know if the pizza has changed since opening, or I'm just getting used to it. But I actually really like it now! Our kids share the Mini Cheese pizza and they have a blast playing in the play area. Now I really hope they stick around. Maybe some theme nights to drum up more business during the week? We ordered our pizzas to go, so we can't comment much on the inside of the restaurant. &#160;From picking up the pizzas, the restaurant looked bigger than it seemed from the outside.The pizzas were really tasty! &#160;The only drawback about their pizza is that the crust is really tough. &#160;But aside from that, the pizzas all had excellent flavor. &#160;We ordered four pizzas: The Pritty Boys Special, The Pritty Girls Special, the Stegosaurs, and the Craver. &#160;All were something I would definitely order again.The only reservation I have about this place is the cost. &#160;A 14" pizza costs around $18 while the 18" pizza costs from $22 - $24. &#160;We were lucky in that we had two buy one get one half off coupons. &#160;In my opinion, a couple pizzas should never cost $50. &#160;But we took out discounted pizzas to a friend's house. &#160;A few others brought salad, drinks and dessert and we chowed down before jumping in the hot tub! &#160;No better way to spend a Friday night. So so pizza to match the SO SLOW service (and it wasn't busy ... in fact, it was pretty empty). &#160;Great salads, kids corner, and ice cream ... Gross and greasy pizza. &#160;Huge disappointment. Good pizza, good pasta and meatballs, great Greek salad. Lots of kids, mediocre service, good location. Kinda messy and chaotic. &#160;Groupon got us there, not sure if we will go without one. Their pizza is pritty delicious. The crust is hand-tossed and fired so it's crispy and soft at the same time. The service, on the other hand, was slow. Our waitress was good but the guy who seated us made a couple move from one table to another so that we could sit. I felt pritty bad for that couple who handled the move graciously. We must have waited a good half hour to 45 minutes for our pizza. Also, because this place is so family friendly, there will be screaming little toddlers running about. Excellent for families but should you be without kids, plan on ordering take-out. I wanted to like this place. Good location. Casual atmosphere. Free XBox and Wii video games, a pinball machine and another video arcade machine for the kids. We came on a Sunday night around 7pm and the place was pretty empty. You might have a wait for the video games on a busier night. Service was slow considering that they were not busy. When the pizza came it was awful. Too salty, way too greasy, the toppings slide off the base, and the crust was chewy as shoe leather. &#160;My friend who lives nearby says the salads are good however I believe that if you are going to call yourself a pizza place then you ought to have a decent pizza.Looking at the other reviews I've never seen a more bipolar set. Half of the reviewers love the pizza and the other half agree with me that the service is lousy and the pizza is terrible. I don't know if this place is inconsistent or just half the people don't know what good pizza is. I suspect it is the latter. KID FRIENDLY! &#160;and the gnocchi is favorable. But the people who work here are IDIOTS. &#160;avoid busy times, because the staff can't handle conflicts and it makes them more idiotic. &#160;In my case they delivered not one but two of our pizzas to different tables and blew it off as a whoops and made us wait longer after waiting much to long already. To be fair, it was just the men staff that were a disappointment (understatement), the young ladies seemed to be responsive to the busy environment and work smarter and faster than their man elders. &#160;-The pizza is good enough-The beer selection is fair - but the beer glasses are terrible pilsner style and too top heavy especially because there are many kids running around. (Makes me want to bring my own pint glass.) -The kid play area is FANTASTIC. We can enjoy a beer and some food, while the kids entertain themselves which is THE selling point. &#160;So much of a kids place, that when i see people there without children, I'm curious about why they are here? and how annoying it must be for them.-It is Madrona, so some of the clientele and their "perfect kids" can do no wrong.We will probably go back after our memories are fuzzy, but will avoid the obvious busy hours (weekend evenings) - that's just asking for trouble and disappointment. This is to update my review of Pritty Boys - They have their website up and running now! I now count this as my favorite pizza in Seattle. I always order the "Garbage Can" - pepperoni, sausage, canadian bacon, black olive, red onion, mushrooms, green pepper. Their crust and their sauce and the high quality ingredients make this an amazing pizza. I crave it weekly. I usually get it to go, but the restaurant is nice, especially if you have children. The pizza is fine. Chewy, not too thick crust, fine sauce, okay selection of toppings. The children! OMG! I am not a child hater, or even a disliker, but there was a pack of 4-5 year-olds using the hallway where we were sitting as a race track. There was much shrieking. We were the only people sitting in the hallway -- maybe later in the evening if there were more tables filled, parents and staff would be more concerned about behavior. What a disaster. Seems to be going downhill fast after an ok start. Sad part is that the pizza is pretty good but actually getting it is not worth the aggravation. Stop by on a Wednesday night at 6:30p to place a carry-out order. There were two tables of two seated and waiting for their dinner; the owner was helping another carryout customer. His two children were running around the restaurant. Hey, it is a family place and I wasn't eating there so that didn't bother me. Not sure how the two tables felt. After placing the order and paying for it, I was told it pizza and two pastas with a salad would be ready in 25 minutes. It was 6:40p according to the receipt. Went back at 7:10p and the owner and his two kids were now eating dinner in one of the booths. One table had their pizza, the other table of two was waiting for their dinner. Waited for a while at the front until another waiter came over and said it would be 5-7 minutes. At 7:30p we got our carryout order. I said we were on a tight schedule since we were headed to the airport and had I known it was going to take 50 minutes I wouldn't have ordered. &#160;He said, "you came at a busy time and we were slammed." Really . . . two tables of two and his own dinner is defined as "slammed" . . . wow. He did however say that if we were in a hurry next time just let him know and he would expedite the order. Seemed odd . . . why say it will take 25 minutes and then have it take 50 . . . just say something like "this will take about an hour" and I could decide whether to wait or not. &#160;I did learn not to pay for a carryout first . . . had I not paid, I would have left. &#160;Too bad-- I like having a place in the neighborhood that I can support but this was just too frustrating. I felt bad for the young guy in the kitchen trying to manage everything . . . I don't blame him, but I do think the management could use some help. &#160; If the owner had not been eating his dinner &#160;while I waited 50 minutes for my carryout order I probably would have been more understanding. At some point I might try it again but need some time to forget about this debacle. We live in the hood, and it is really too bad that we don't have a good pizza place nearby. Pritty Boys pizza is chewy, tasteless and misses the mark. I hope they will read the reviews because if they pull it together they could really do well in Madrona. &#160;How hard is it to make good pizza??? Pizza is super yummy- we get the garbage can. &#160;We usually get take out but have eaten at the restaurant a few times and the service is a bit slow- the only reason for the 4 stars. &#160;the play area is great for kids but I wouldnt love going there if I didnt have a 3 year old myself. &#160;Yummy!!
Finally. My kid has come to her senses. She now begs for the TB pie.But more important even than that is the Attibassi Coffee Bar - open 6a-10p daily.I am in love with the cute and adorable barista. I'm sure he feels the same way about me because he gives me the coffee. The best coffee in Seattle, I might add. Plus his name is Giovanni. It's fun to say and I can moon about him and completely embarrass my kid. Giovanni is doing double duty with my double latte. This place was really cool. &#160;As we were looking for apartments in Seattle, our real estate agent took us to Tutta Bella for lunch. &#160;First of all, as a new arrival in the city, I'd never been to Columbia City. &#160;What an awesome area. &#160;But the lunch endeared the neighborhood to us even more. &#160;Everything we had - from the salad to the pizza to the AWESOME tiramisu - was really good. &#160;The service was good, and the whole experience was very pleasant. &#160;I'll definitely be back once we're settled in the city. I think this place has excellent food however the price is not justified by the size. &#160;Pizza joints have the lowest overhead cost and are one of the most profitable restaurant ventures there is. &#160;So when you charge $12.50 for a personal sized pizza, that is not cool. &#160;I know, I know, ingredients and all that business but still, over priced. YUM! &#160;The food was delicious and easy on the wallet.We started with the cesar salad (please excuse me for not remembering the italian named dishes), big enough for two to share, &#160;and adorned with whole, delicious anchovies. &#160;The basil and tomato pizza was exactly what I expected. thin crusted and fresh ingredients. &#160;Perfect with a glass of wine!We also indulged in an after dinner espresso con panna made on their hand pulled espresso machine. &#160;The best espresso I had on this trip to seattle. What a great place for Columbia City. &#160;Wonderful wonderful food. &#160;Great place for lunch or even a fairly inexpensive &#160;date night. I've been to Tutta Bella twice. &#160;The first time was during a 2007 New Years party: I'd been drinking and I was high on boyfriend lovin', so the food and service were not well-remembered. &#160;The second time (a few nights ago) I was cranky from hunger (bad), worried that my dog was going to pee in his kennel (also bad), but hanging out with said boyfriend (good). &#160;Hopefully, that makes this a more honest review.The pizza was good. &#160;Not great; not all right; good. &#160;The portions are large, the ingredients are of high quality, and the selection managed to sate both my boyfriend's "GIVE ME MEAT!" mindset and my "ooh! eggplant!" pretentiousness.The big win: dessert and coffee. &#160;The gelatto was delicious (nutella!) and the lattes satisfied my picky espresso-craving tongue. &#160;I was pleasently surprised.To top it off, we had an attentive server and a reasonable bill (I think; boyfriend nabbed it). &#160;All in all, a win-win experience.Oh, and the dog managed to hold it until we got home. &#160;Phew! Pizza lover that I am, I always look forward to a Tutta Bella pie. &#160;Their crust is really substantial, not thick and greasy but chewy and thin and baked in their fire oven. &#160;Big selection of pizza but I like things simple and go for the cheese. &#160;Great salads and pretty friendly service and any place you can get a nice glass of vino in the afternoon with your lunch gets brownie points. &#160;They have other menu items but their pizza is their signature and very good. Lively joint, only had to wait about 10 minutes on a Sunday night for a table. Pros: &#160;Crust and sauce are great. Pizza and salad choices look great, and ingredients tasted fresh. Green-friendly establishment. Nice wine menu. Great atmosphere, friendly waitstaff. Nice dessert and coffee selection.Cons: Salad (Salermo) was just ok. We had prosciutto and mushrooms on the pizza and were in the mood for more cheese, which we found to be pretty light. The pizza was also pretty messy/wet. &#160;Waiter couldn't recommend a wine to go with the pizza (and didn't volunteer to ask someone who might). Music playing in the bar, while lively, was a bit much for a lazy sunday night. &#160;And they were out of cream - which is weird, because buying cream from a corner store wouldn't have been difficult....If you like Napoli style pizza, you'll love it. Most of my cons could have been due to the pizza and salad we chose. When we go back we'll make a different selection and I'll update the post. Overall I really enjoyed Tutta Bella. Solid venue to take a group of friends to eat, and pretty much guarantee a good time. I like the white pizzas - sans red sauce, usually golden olive oil layered with great cheese, maybe some proscuitto and carmelized onions. &#160;Decent gelato (hey, we ain't Italy), go for a scoop of the lemon and milk chocolate - the sweet offsets the sour nicely. &#160;My favorite item on the menu, though, is the Napoli Salad - chicken, olives, bacon, artichoke hearts - what's not to love?Oh, and the prices are very good, very affordable. &#160;Can be a little loud inside, but it's all good fun. super over-rated. the salads are decent and the pizzas are hit and miss. more often than not my pizza is way too dry and crispy and even too burnt for my liking. gelato is always yummy. overpriced. servers could be nicer. and i ADORE when people bring in their screaming children and think that its ok for the children to be running around and hitting my chair- NOT. haven't been here in months and don't ever intend on going back unless dragged or desperate. I love Tutta Bella, the pizza is excellent and the service is always great! &#160;They use a wood burning stove to cook their Neapolitan-style pizza and the crust always comes out so light and fluffy. &#160;They've got a decent wine list to choose from and when you get the bill at the end of your meal, its very reasonable considering all the delicious food you just ate coupled with a nice dining experience. I've tried many of the vegetarian pizzas they offer and by far my favorite is the Biancha (olive oil, oregano, caramelized onions and goat cheese). &#160;Finish with some nutella gelato and you are good to go! Fast service and great wine and pizza. &#160;Love it. Ok.. so I am not familiar with Tutta Bella.. My friend and I were just walking along and decided to pop in here. I am not a huge fan of pizza... so I just figured I'd get pasta. It's an Italian restaurant right?? Well no luck on the pasta. It's pizza or salad.My friend ordered pizza and I went with the oh so boring caesar salad. I did however have a slice of his and it was...... ok. &#160;The crust was a bit too thin and soft for my taste and there were not enough toppings. It was a sausage, olive, basil, and tomato pizza... With only a few of each spread about the whole pie. The flavor of the toppings was good.. but I needed more. I guess it was just too gourmet for me.The service was mediocre but I dug the atmosphere. It was casual with a little class. I don't think I will be back here.... since pizza and salad are not really my thing.. but this place does have potential! Great wine menu. If you want an authentic Italian expereince with caring customer service, in a comfotable environment - this is the place. I've always been impressed with the little details here (as well as the high quality food). They serve Italian wines and beers, the staff is knowledgible about the menu, the ingredients are all authentic and imported from Italy . . . &#160;it doesn't get any better. My only feedback for improvement is that this location can get a bit loud. I prefer to eat outside for dinner because of this or to go for lunch. Bravo! A great Seattle restaurant. wow this place was great~ love the neapolitan pizza~ I adore the fact that Tutta Bella has vegan options on the menu and you don't have to ask them to modify anything. The Insalata Di Mista, with white beans and kalamata olives, is lovely, light and tasty. The Marinara Napoletana is simple -- San Marzano tomatoes, garlic, oregano and olive oil. Truly tasty. This is the only location I've visited, but I'm excited that there is one on Denny, since that is much closer to my hood. Was fairly excited about popping my Tutta Bella cherry - friends raved, it's in the cute downtown of Columbia City and I am a whore for Via Tribunali. Sadly, the mind-foreplay far exceeded the what-could-have-been wondrous orgasm.The space is part cafeteria/part dining room - throughout dinner, customers repeatedly darted pass the dining room to the cashier counter to place and/or pick-up orders. After a few times it started to feel a bit intrusive!The food felt more Pizza Hut than Via Tribunali. The Insalata Salerno was overly coated in its dressing and there seemed to be more romaine bits than there was mozzarella. The pizza (three of us shared the Tutta Bella and Quattro Stagioni) were soggy crusted and more medium in size (if Tribunali's are considered large). Dessert lacked a spark, but being the little piggies we are, finished it up...begrudgingly...I PROMISE!Tutta Bella is great for families and is a great amenity for an up-and-coming neighborhood. They don't take rezzies on Fridays and Saturdays, but was instructed to call 30 minutes ahead of arriving to be placed on the wait list. We did and got seated immediately upon arriving. However, if you're looking for Neapolitan pizza, I'd strongly urge you to patron Via Tribunali instead - better eats and better ambience (Cap Hill location, that is). My favorite place for a good thin crust pizza! &#160;Love their daily specials - have gotten delicious breakfast pizza (egg, mozzarella, mushroom), seasonal veggie/fruit pizza (figs, balsamic vinegar, basil). &#160;I personally prefer the Columbia City location (even though the farthest from where I live), the atmosphere, the food and the service are at its best at this original location.Wine list is so so, but the desserts &amp; coffee are superb!
So I wouldn't not go here. &#160;But there's just so much else that is good. &#160;It's a diner, and not even the best. &#160;Service is fine, the food is fair, you can get egg whites which is my requirement for a breakfast spot, but at the end of the day if you want anything more than AM nourishment, scroll to the top of this very page, and type "breakfast" in the Search for field and "Seattle, WA" in the Near field and you'll do better. Good, not great. I've been here twice- once for drinks and once for breakfast. The first time was for drinks and I hated it and vowed never to return. However, the boyfriend's parents were in town and this is a breakfast place right near our house, so we went.Pretty good breakfast. I'd rate the breakfast as four star and the drinks as two, so the overall so far is a three.I'd definitely recommend this place for breakfast, but nothing else. Went for breakfast with a group of 8 on a Saturday morning. &#160;We were seated right away and had prompt and courteous service. &#160;Great $4 Bloody Mary and tasty Eggs Monterey. &#160;I would definitely go back to try out more items on their large breakfast menu. Pretty standard greasy spoon type restaurant. The potatoes (breakfast) were good but nothing earth shattering. Low prices, decent service. Why is it that all the great breakfast places are packed consistently through breakfast? &#160;How are you supposed to experience the joy of a waffle or an egg - over easy - if you can't get in the door?Having said that I've waited in line to have breakfast at the Blue Star, and dinner as well, and have always had a great experience with the food and service.Mimosas and beers flow freely, and the food is more than typical pub grub. &#160;Go and wait for breakfast, go to watch a game at the bar, or go with a group and be able to actually talk to everyone as the ambiance allows for it . . . oh for Christ's sake - just go to Blue Star. Part 1: I just popped in here for a pint. I didn't eat, but the food I witnessed was being served and then quickly devoured by the patrons. I'm not sure when I'll be in the area again but I'll be sure to have a bite when I am. For now they get four stars on my excellent pint of the green lake organic ale. It was rich yet smooth and really effin tasty! I'll give 'em another star if I'm impressed with the food and service.Part 2: Coming Soon! (maybe) Dear Eggs Cetera Blue Star Cafe &amp; Pub, Thank-you for introducing me to pear cider. Mmm, pear cider. Thank-you also for setting aside your back room for my book club and providing friendly service. &#160;My fish &amp; chips were decent. &#160;Your food doesn't seem to be spectacular, but that's okay -- I'll come back for the cider (and maybe give breakfast a chance) and the casual pub atmosphere again. Sincerely,Dawn A. What's good about Blue Star?1) bottle their own habanero hot sauce2) the name "Eggs Cetera's"3) they have a "bake" thingy that is eggs covered with tortilla chips and cheese and baked in an oven4) beer with breakfast!5) sweet graph artwork outside Sunday morning breakfast with a friend of mine is quickly becoming a tradition. It was my week to choose the destination, and at 11 am, after cruising by an intimidatingly packed Portage Bay Cafe... we drove down 45th to survey the options. I had Blue Star in mind but was afraid we'd suffer a similar fate because god knows Seattleites love their brunch... Much to my surprise, not only was there no line out the door, there was a parking spot right in front! It was truly meant to be. Anyways..We were seated right away! 11 o'clock on a Sunday! Right Away! Can you believe it? It's not like no one was there either, it was packed! Man...Ordered a coffee and their oatmeal waffle. I realize I was committing some kind of crime against humanity by not ordering from their impressive, two page list of eggs and omlettes- but hey, I wanted a waffle. It was delicious too- and it wasn't enormous which I actually appreciated. I didn't feel the usual, oh my god I don't want to eat for three days, kinda thing that I usually experience after any breakfast excursion. Thank you Blue Star. Thank you for not making me feel disgusting. &#160;All in all a pleasant, pleasant experience. Beer and Banana Waffles for Breakfast??!?You betcha! And don't forget the strawberry jam! Blue Star has an excellent grease-fest breakfast (although they do offer a nice selection of breads to toast, as well as fresh fruit bowls). It is HANGOVER HEAVEN: bloody mary, shot of whiskey, pint o' beer plus eggs, hashbrowns, steak, burger, gravy, fries - whatever your sloggy Sunday morning brain and body may require to start the day and finish the weekend. The morning service is quick and to-the-point. And the coffee is always fresh and plentiful.However, BEWARE of the evening hours: the service is not so great. I ordered a bowl of soup (MMM! Vegetarian chili every day), and it sat under the heat lamp for 20 minutes while he cooked a chicken sandwich and a burger for my friends. So, my food was a bit cold. Besides, it should not have taken that long to cook that food.But, in any case, Blue Star has a great menu range, is vegetarian-friendly, serve quality alcohol at ridiculous hours (as well as non-alcoholic beverages, like the most lemony lemonade to ever pucker your sweet lips). I recommend for a post-party Sunday morning. I think I remember being here once before for breakfast, but only remembered it was a weekend (I think) and REALLY crowded.We recently came here on a Saturday at 5pm and it wasn't crowded at all. They only had a lunch menu at the time which were only burgers and sandwiches. Which were just fine. Chad had the chicken sandwich and he said it was good and crispity. The fries were also decent. Just like at Buckley's (or any other sports bar really) - just right crispy, not limpy. Yes, you heard me say it - VIAGRA FRIES!!Beer selection was very good. I think I just had the Manny's, but I always consider it "very good" when they have something from Dechutes available.The server was kinda bubbly. Chad said she looked like a clown... I'm sorry, I mean jester - with her colorful shirt, denim skirt and brightly colored argyles. She was attentive, even though it took us about 10 minutes just to get our beer. After that, things went swimmingly.Oh, and we saw two kids whom I thought were dressed like hobos, or orphans from Oliver!, but they turned out to be zombies. (This visit of course was just before Halloween).Anyways, a more "fleshed out" review to follow once we go back for the real test - their dinner menu! If you're ever looking for a good Mimosa or Bloody Mary at 8am on ANY DAY this is the place (haha come on we've all been there). &#160;I can't help but order one every time I'm here, no matter what time of day. &#160;They have a pretty good selection of omelette's as well. I adore that they use avocado, and will double up on it if you say pretty please!Good food, good drinks! &#160;Head out early if you plan on going on a Saturday or Sunday morning. &#160;It gets crowded pretty quickly and you can be left waiting for a while. I am a fan of brunch. What I mean by that is: I do not like to get up early on weekends, yet I still like to go somewhere that serves a good omelette. We've had to wait at least 10 minutes for a table each time we've gone - today was an exception to that rule, as we waited half an hour. But Seattle folks like their brunch, so when you show up at noon, you can't expect to be seated right away.I like that their omelettes aren't too big - big enough, but not gargantuan. I opted for fruit instead of potatoes today and don't think I'll ever go back to potatoes...the fruit was fresh and crisp! Although the place was packed, our service wasn't that slow.Never been for any meal other than brunch, and I'm not sure it's a place I'll ever think of for lunch or dinner - but for brunch, it gets my thumbs up. It pains me to give Blue Star a negative review because it does have its extra perks (the service is extremely friendly and I mean, they do have coloring books), but I have to defer to the mediocre quality of the food.The place prides itself in its egg dishes and having tired several on the menu I think I can only recommend the Top Gun, and not fully at that. &#160;The potatoes are sub-par--Seattle really does set a high bar for potatoes, and the side salad was one of the only restaurant salads I couldn't finish.All this said, if you are looking for a friendly neighborhood place to get brunch that won't make you wait an unbearable amount of time to be seated (particularly if there are more than 2-3 of you), this is a reasonable place to go.In this case, I would certainly recommend you order the super potatoes (+bacon, +sour cream, +cheese) and/or the Top Gun (an egg dish featuring spinach, tomatoes, sour cream and bacon). &#160;At the very least, make sure you stick to the breakfast menu--the lunch menu from all experiences is definitely out of its game. I've been told that the Blue Star Cafe has fabulous breakfasts. &#160;Perhaps I should try breakfast there sometime. &#160;Last time I was there I ordered "risotto with chicken", and it was pretty bad. &#160; I could probably reproduce it, like so: get a pot of watered-down Campbell's tomato soup simmering, and throw in one can of whole stewed tomatoes. Add some rice, and let it sit all day long. When you're ready to serve, mix in 5 leaves of spinach, and top with a dry, grilled chicken breast. Gross. Plus, they didn't use Arborio rice. Heck, I'm not even sure they used regular long grain rice. The "rice" was so mushy it was hard to tell exactly what it was.I ate it, though, because a) I'd been running around all evening and by the time I got there it was 7:45 and I was starving, b) I hate making a scene in restaurants, or anywhere else, and c) I didn't want to make my friends wait.I guess it's my own darn fault for ordering risotto from a pub. Everyone else ordered burgers and they all looked really really good, but I just wasn't in the mood for something so heavy. &#160;I will say, however, that our waitress was phenomenal. &#160;She was extremely friendly, very accommodating, and didn't kick us out for staying to chat long after we'd finished dessert. &#160;2 stars for the restaurant, 5 stars for the waitstaff! I'm fairly certain you can't get pancakes here, which surprised me. &#160;Thankfully, I was in the mood for an omelette. &#160;Anyway, I went on a Monday morning when the place was empty. &#160;Apparently, that's the only time to go, since the brunch can get crazy. &#160;The service was good and the food was satsifyingly average. &#160;It's in a very pleasant part of town and there are plenty of shops surrounding it if you want to turn your breakfast into a "breakfast and morning of walking." &#160;Not a bad place by any stretch, but not worth a trip unless you live in the area.
I work in this neighborhood all the time. &#160;How did I miss this place? &#160;I was working right around the corner and could smell the smoker! &#160;What a fantastic aroma! &#160;Great prices are matched with excellent taste. &#160;I had the pulled pork sandwich with a hot link on top, a side of potato salad, and a Coke. &#160;All for $9! &#160;This is definitely a 2-3 napkin sandwich.....if you want to put it down. &#160;The meats were cooked to perfection and complimented each other well. &#160;The sauce is a little on the sweet side, but balanced nicely with the hot link. &#160;Like Arnold says... &#160;"I'll be back." YUM!!! &#160;If you're looking for great BBQ go here first.This BBQ is fantastic. &#160;I got the pulled pork sandwich, and let me tell you it hit the right spot. &#160;Walking in I was hungry as a bear, and I was skeptical that the $5.50 sandwich would fill me up, oh but it did (I even had a slight food baby). &#160;A lot of times eating pulled pork sandwiches can be a messy affair (which isn't unreasonable). &#160;Here they wrap your sandwich nice and neat so its pulled pork goodness is all contained. &#160;Also, the meat to sauce ratio was spot on--I enjoy a little more sauce than some people--for me. &#160;I also had a taste of the hot links. &#160;Quite yummy as well. &#160;You have an option of putting a hot link on top of your sandwich, and I think I'm going to try that next time. &#160;The only thing The Barbeque Pit is missing is sweet tea. Yelp posts 11:30a opening. But what's on the door says 12:00p. Someone needs to fix that.Food wise: I had the pulled pork sandwich. It was a nice healthy sized sandwich. The pork was lightly sauced - the way I like it. But, the meat didn't have the smokey flavor that I enjoy and that makes it worth the trip.I also had it spiked with a hot link which made up for the missing smoke flavor a bit. However, I had a side of greens and damned if they were lukewarm to cold. I hate that. If they were hot I'm sure that they would have been good - they were firm not soggy and mushy.Also, get there early. There is a school up the street that gives them a lot of business at lunch time. I was driving down Cherry Street and you can't miss the BBQ smell as you're getting close. &#160;Seemed I just needed to drop by and do a bit of carry out on a beautiful sunny Labor Day weekend. &#160; &#160;This is a spartan place and just the basics of a counter to order, a chalkboard for prices and bell to ring to order. &#160;The service was pleasant and I could tell the owners put a lot of love into what they're cooking here.I ended up ordering a slab of ribs to eat a bit later in the day. &#160; I thought it would be a slab, but it was already cut a bigger portion than I actually expected lathered in their BBQ sauce.The ribs were big; perfectly cooked; tender and lightly smoked. &#160;The sauce was too sweet for my taste and I'd recommend you get the ribs dry and choose to add the sauce to your taste.If they would have had a great Carolinas mustard sauce based on yellow mustard and vinegar; then I would have been in heaven.This is a great find and the prices are great! I lived in Kansas City for 6 years, so I'm accustomed to good barbecue. This place is pretty darn good. While it looks a bit sketchy from the outside, and the lighting is pretty dim on the inside, the food is what counts. I'd say this style of BBQ is pretty close to KC style - more molasses and brown sugar in the sauce, making in sweeter rather than spicy or vinegary. I ordered the ribs and pulled pork, both are great. Driving by this place at least once a day, I love the smoky BBQ smell. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could, only because I'm still a loyal KC BBQ fan. What an amazing place!Food aside, Pookie and Tony are some of the most enjoyable people I have ever met. Their love of food and their lively personalities is what will keep me coming back.The other reason to come back to the restaurant... the RIBS!!! So amazingly, lip smacking, finger licking deliciousness!I left so full and happy, I couldn't wipe the smile off my face for a long time.The story --- &#160;My boyfriend and I went into the restaurant tonight, and was informed that they were all sold out of the ribs (since they had huge amount of orders for the super bowl the next day.) I was devastated! Then Pookie (the master smoker) informed me that he had just put some ribs in. Then he proceeded to pick out the best piece, brought it out to show me, and told me he would save that particular one just for me!!! and that it would be finished smoking in 1 1/2 hours. Well, since we took the bus there, we waited the rest of the time in the restaurant. Pookie and Tony were kind enough to keep us entertained. Pookie even came out and described to us the difference between the slab of ribs, and a pound of ribs. Really interesting conversation piece! For you old Seattleites this is the reincarnation of James Beal's "Wild Boar." &#160;The ribs were ALMOST as good as the Late Mr. Beal and without a doubt the best in town.The beans could have had more bbq sauce and some pork in them but I talked with the owner and I can only hope you will too.People talk about other BBQ joints and they might be fine for them. &#160;For this Seattle Man it is "The Barbeque Pit" even if it is a half hour drive.'Some others like Jones are passable but this is the real thing for me.Stop by, you will have not regrets. &#160;(Ask for the beans if you don't like Potato Salad.) Food: First I have to mention that I am not very experienced with bbq (honestly no one that has grown up exclusively in the NW is familiar with bbq). I can say that the pulled pork sandwich is absolutely delectable. This is a sandwich with piles upon piles of smokey tender pieces of pork smothered in a tangy sweet bbq .Trust me it will fill you up. I have had this sandwich at least 3-4 times so far and it has consistently delivered. The ribs aren't too bad either but I prefer dry rub. Good amount of meat on each piece. I have to agree with a previous review that coleslaw or pickles would be a great addition to help add some different textures to the palate.Service: The owner is very friendly and is very willing to talk with you about almost everything. He is also very receptive to your suggestions (I suggested one that he find a YELP sticker as well as additional lighting). Food is served promptly and there is tables and chairs outside made of wood (yes wood!). The guy was super friendly and the Pulled pork sandwich was tasty. &#160;Make sure to get extra napkins. Saw good reviews for this place and always wanted to try. &#160;I headed here for lunch with a couple of friends from out of town. &#160;We arrived around 12:30. &#160;The open sign wasn't out or on. &#160;Door was unlocked and I poke my head in and was told they were just opening. &#160;It was a quiet Tuesday and we were the only diners besides a to go order. &#160;We order a pulled pork sandwich, pulled brisket sandwich and the rib tips plus a couple sides (beans and coleslaw). &#160;Prices are really good. &#160;5.50 for the sandwiches, 1.50 for the sides and the 7 for the tips. &#160;All came in large portions and piping hot. &#160;My friend enjoyed the sandwiches. &#160;One said the beef was on the dry side. &#160;Side were run of the mill. &#160;The rib tips were very saucy and some pieces were dry. &#160;Overall, not bad. &#160;The service could be better. &#160;Just took our order and gave us food. &#160;Nice people but it seems like unless you were a regular, it's just business as usual. Pros - Good BBQ, great prices, large portions, and easy street parking. &#160;Cons - Dining room is small (4 tables) and service could be better. &#160;I would recommend this place for some good BBQ. Coworker found this place on yelp and picked us up some dinner. &#160;He reports that it is CASH ONLY. &#160;So bring paper. &#160;Now, the food:We ordered a pound of rib tips, and a half pound of ribs, a side of bbq beans and potato salad, and a piece of the sweet potato pie.In the order I tried them:The BBQ beans were yummy. &#160;Not the best, but good. &#160;Mad Oven in the Business District does better.Potato salad was standard. &#160;I can't find better than Mom's anywhere.The ribs: &#160;Oh wow, the ribs. &#160;Fall of the bone, smokey, saucy, tangy, moist. &#160;That is a fine rib.The rib tips: &#160;OH MY GOD. &#160;These are SPECTACULAR. &#160;It's like a rib, with more smoke flavor!! &#160;Some more fat on these than the ribs, but a pound of them can easily feed 2 people we put leftovers in the fridge. &#160;These, as other reviews point out, are a stand out item. &#160;I rate them above the ribs, which says a lot because I LOVE RIBS.The Sweet Potato Pie: Heavy on the spices. &#160;The consistency wasn't quite there. &#160;Don't get me wrong, it's a good pie, but it's not grandmas, and I've had better from restaurants too.I give this a 4, because the BBQ is the best I have found in Seattle, but the sides weren't up to the standards of the meats. &#160;But if you want ribs, this is THE PLACE (so far.... the search is never done). Definitely the best BBQ I have had in the Pacific Northwest. &#160;The cook is a helluva nice guy as well... just keep him away from those hot links! . &#160;The word delicious isn't even close to describing how belly warming, heart smiling, good the food is at the Barbeque Pit. &#160;My fianc&#233;e introduced me to pulled pork, ribs, and most meaty southern food. Over the years I thought the bbq he made at home was already super tasty. &#160;Then he took me here and I could not believe how jaw dropping, finger licking, excellently delightful it tasted. Plus it won't put a dent in your pocket book! &#160; &#160; The pulled pork, which only costs $5.50, came in a very large portion, so much I thought I would not be able to finish it, but I did. &#160;Most people would find the amount of pork to sandwich perfect, and I guess it was because I left stuffed but not uncomfortable. The pork was seasoned to the point of perfection and the sauce complimented the pork, giving enough zest and spice to the hardy and rich sandwich.  &#160; &#160; On top of having the sandwich we had baked beans and a hot link for sides (links are only $1 more and super flavorful, if you have enough room in your tummy I recommend getting one). I have always liked baked beans, but I loved these ones. &#160; They were sweet, warm, and naturally creamy, like beans should be, and the perfect side with the pork. &#160; And the hot link, well you can never go wrong with a hot link when it's cooked on an open flame that's tended with such care. &#160; &#160; &#160;When we finished we were given the best dose of hospitality and encourage in try a rib. &#160;The ribs and sauce combined like magic on my tongue. &#160;I now dream about the Rib dinner ($12.50- comes with mashed potatoes and a side). Not only did the meat fall into my mouth and off the bone, the seasoning and smokiness was delectable; then the kick of spicy, warm, and mouth watering rib sauce. &#160;The owner put enough sauce on it as not to hide the rib flavor, but enough that the ribs were still kicking with spice, just the way it should be.  &#160; &#160; I walked over two miles one way to taste this food. I am adventurous, but 4 miles total for some BBQ I thought this probably won't be worth it. &#160;I was completely wrong, I would walk 20, 50, maybe 60 miles to eat at the Barbeque Pit again. &#160;The food was incredible, the smell wafting from the little brick building was wonderful, the atmosphere was warm, friendly, and peaceful, plus the owner makes all his own wood tables and chairs. &#160;I wish Seattle made all BBQ as good as the guy here does, lucky for him they don't, but not too lucky for my legs. Everything was great, the ribs, the greens, the sweet potato pie. &#160;Love this place. Mmmmmm. I had a rib dinner with beans and greens. Best BBQ that I have eaten in years, maybe ever. I left with a smile on my face so wide. Stop by this summer and enjoy. Stopped by this Sunday for a pleasant surprise. &#160;What a great place! &#160;The decor isn't fancy but peeking behind the ordering counter revealed a serious smoker and a truly excellent owner.This fellow is seriously TOP SHELF, courteous, kind and surrounded by a quiet confidence that shows in the food. &#160;We ordered two sandwiches: the beef and the hotlink. &#160;Both were superb and yes I enjoy the sweeter sauces. &#160;Someone is asking, "Well why only Three Stars?" &#160;Well it's just everything that's missing. &#160;Where are the pickles, or the slaw? &#160;Sweet Que needs a foil, a briny cool crunch to offset the sweet and soft.I'll be back to discover more - hopefully this menu is on the grow! We were driving down the Cherry St when the smoke from the pit hit us and we knew we had to stop and we were very glad we did. &#160;We had pulled pork and beef sandwiches to go because we had just eaten dinner at a different restaurant.Both sandwiches were sublime. &#160;The sauce was sweet and sour and smoky and complex in a hundred different ways. &#160;The texture of the meat was perfect, just enough chew and bite without being soggy or hard. &#160;Everything was perfect. &#160;It may have been some of the best BBQ I've ever had and I grew up in the South. &#160;We also go ONE piece of Sweet Potato Pie to split with my Mother-in-law whom had had dental surgery earlier in the day. &#160;I had in my mind a picture of three adults taking turns with fork fulls of the pie making intellectual comments about how it was different than pumpkin pie. &#160;Instead, my Mother-in-law chomped it down like she was a barracuda. &#160;Both my husband and I really wanted more but we were afraid to get between her and her new all-time-favorite pie.So to sum up: &#160;Awesome BBQ and buy more pie than you think you will need. The first true wood-fired pit BBQ restaurant I've found in town and (according to this BBQ loving Texas) the best pork ribs in Seattle. &#160;Pulled pork was solid, but the rib tips and ribs were the standout items. &#160;It was a pleasure meeting Pookie and his love of BBQ is evident in his product. Well I stopped in to try out their BBQ. &#160;I had heard good things about the ribs and the potato salad. &#160;Got there right about noon and the owner recommends that isnt' the time for adults as the school kids swarm him during their half hour lunch. &#160;But he got me my dinner and I boogied and didn't see any kids. Everything was very tasty. &#160;The baked beans were very smokey and sweet and the potato salad was the creamy mustard with pickles type. &#160;The ribs were very tender and tasty, nice and meaty and almost fell off the bone. &#160; I'd go again...just not at 12. The bbq is delicious. &#160;I really loved my pulled pork sandwich. It was also very large. I could not eat all of it at once. I also had the greens which I really enjoyed. They were not overcooked which I especially appreciated since a lot of places cook greens too much in my opinion. The potato salad was creamy and delicious and I am not a fan of potato salad. The ribs were very good and again, my order contained a hefty portion of them. &#160;The owner is very personable. That's nice, but if you are waiting to order, I can see someone becoming irritated with the laid back behavior. I was hoping they had some mac &amp; cheese but they didn't. The baked beans were very good. The food was good. I was headed to the dive bar across the street when I smelled this place last night. A few hours later, I decided I just had to go back across the street for dinner from this place. In 5 minutes I had a cheap and GREAT pulled pork sandwich (i'm from the south and picky with my BBQ) I hope to be back in this area soon to go back, it is delicious. I wanted to get round 2 to take home but it was past their closing time. Whoa, whoa, ohh good lord. This place is really deliciously good. I had a pulled pork sandwich, collard greens, and baked beans, and in all my years of eating these things all over the nation, this place wins my deepest affections. I usually expect to feel heavy and "ugh why did I eat so much" after a bbq lunch, but this fantastic food made me feel light and energized and really good. I loved it here. Plus, the interior is cool and it smells really good and smoky. Hands down, the best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had - the ribs a friend hand looked awesome as well. &#160;Great bang for your buck!
Terrible service. No, not just terrible, ANNOYING and terrible. What's up with that big screen that wacks you in the face the second you walk in the door? And why are the tables so suffocatingly close together? And why is that waiter (Rod? something like that) so in-your-face annoying when you want him to just take your order and leave, yet when an hour goes by and you STILL don't have your pizza, he sails right past you, obviously avoiding eye contact and your pleas for something - anything - to nibble on before your blood sugar crashes through the floor. When the pizza finally arrive, you learn (because Rod announces it quite loudly) that it was all the kitchens fault, they somehow never got your order (the order that had to be substituted because they were out of turkey for the turley panini). No one to blame but the kitchen, no siree, certainly not HIS fault even though you never once saw him actually check on your order. Sadly, the pizza I did eventually get was really tasty, but nope, the place is officially on the "list" of Greenwood restaurants that I can never go back to. &#160;The others being Pig and Whistle because I once found a chicken bone in my quesadilla and nearly choked, and Yannis because I have never gotten an order there in under an hour. Good thing there are LOTS of other great places to eat in my neighborhood!
This is officially my least favorite Thai restaurant in Belltown. I came here the other day for the phad thai/rice/entr&#233;e combo. It's my new favorite lunch special, I think. I ordered the cashew chicken combination, but substituted tofu in for the chicken. I was given soup, a spring roll, rice, phad thai and cashew chicken for $9.95, which was higher than Buddha Belltown and Golden Singha. The portions were also much smaller. I didn't have any leftovers, while at the other two Thai restaurants, I had plenty.Right after we ordered, we were given soup. It was just chicken broth with a few floaty vegetables. Our food arrived at different times but it was mostly decent. The main even here was when I bit into my spring roll, I looked at it to see what was inside and there was a black hair sticking out. I even took a picture this time! Can somebody please explain to me why I'm having the worst food luck ever lately? In the past few weeks, I've gotten a glass with lipstick on it, a six inch hair in my mango pudding, and now a hair in my spring roll. Blech. Lesson: Skip Bell Thai and go over to Golden Singha if you must eat thai food in Belltown, however I'm thinking next time I'll go up to Queen Anne and avoid the area all together. Met some friends here for lunch on Friday. There wasn't much selection on the menu, but it could have just been their lunch menu. I ordered my Thai restaurant tester dish: Pad see ew. I would say it was ok, could use a little more soy sauce, but it wasn't awful. I'd probably come by again since it's not too far out of the way. Prices were reasonable. With the Pad see ew came a portion of rice and 2 baby egg rolls, for $8.95. Some of the best Thai I've ever had since leaving New York. Not sure how this place has such a low rating, but this is the home of the best Tom Kah soup in Seattle.
I think the term "greasy spoon" is over used, but this place fits that description. The food was great, the service was good and I would definitely go back. I had a 6 egg omelet and it was enormous, mostly because it came on top of about 1.5 pounds of hashbrowns (which were excellent, nice and crispy) and toast. I can eat a lot and I still only got through half of it. I highly recommend!Beware that parking is in short supply.P.S. order something with bacon, it was perfetly cooked, thick and crispy. Great food and service.The wife and I saw Beth's mentioned on the Evening Magazine show one night and made a mental note to try it out sometime. We are not life-long Seattleites, so sometimes we don't know about these old staples that all the locals are well aware of.We heard about the 12-egg omelets and the all-you-can-eat hasbrowns and thought it would be best frequented sometime when we were uber-hungry. We went on a morning we stayed up late and were going over to visit a friend in Bremerton the next day.I was glad to see they had only 6-egg versions of the omelet, because obviously no "human" could eat a 12-egg omelet. I kinda thought the hasbrowns would be pretty poor since they were all-you-can-eat, but I was happily wrong. The hasbrowns were excellent. The omelet was good (not excelent, but good).Overall, we enjoyed it and would definitely go back if we are ever going to be in Seattle during the morning hours (we live on Eastside). Had a great experience here at Beth's for breakfast.. &#160;I see a few negative views of people saying "Oh for the money I could have made it at home".. &#160;I went to several places in Seattle in different parts of town and all the breakfast are similar in price.. Beth's is fairly priced and online with all the other diner style joints in town.. The portions at Beth's and all over town at these type places are huge and they all have really great coffee so be hungry folks..It is what we thought and saw on the "Man vs Food, Seattle" episode.. Yes!! &#160;Its a diner. &#160; I was going to do the 12 egg challenge until I saw the tray they bring it out on and realized there was no chance for me to even come close.. I had the chicken fried steak and eggs which was awesome.. It was a real piece of steak run through a tenderizer or hand pounded and was crispy and delicious.. A really tasty gravy on top of the chicken fried steak and hash browns with the rye toast and I was in heaven.. When ever I'm in Northern Seattle &#160;I will definitely visit Beth's Cafe again.. Beth's is a fantastic diner, so long as you know what to expect. &#160;It is the epitome of greasy spoon with a great atmosphere. &#160;Their hashbrowns are probably best in town (my favorite at least), and many of their other dishes are great as well, if not a bit greasy. &#160;Prices aren't the best, but they are reasonable and comparable to the other greasy spoons in Seattle.My favorite part is always the drawings on the wall, since you never know what you'll see. &#160;As a warning, I have found a few crass ones over the years, so something to perhaps be aware of if dining with anyone sensitive to such things (kids or otherwise). &#160;If you do happen to notice something, the staff should have no problem removing it though, as they seem to have an endless supply of fresh drawings.About the staff, I've had some great friendly waiters/waitresses, and some who barely made an appearance. &#160;It really depends on how busy they are most of the time, and generally being a late night patron I tend to get better service than when I've been there for lunch/dinner times. I may be a picky eater...Stoners---feeding us? ummmmm. I think you are fine off going to Dennys instead.American breakfast for lunch is the best!! And most finest, especially when you came from a long walk in Green lake. Got a BOGO coupon w/o it, the taste would not have been worth it. I notice they microwave almost everything.I got the egg omelet, french toast, eggs, bacon, (mini breakfast, but it was mighty!!)tater totes are delicious until they start to cold. Of course we saw this on Man vs Food and had to check it out. It is not fancy and I wouldn't say it was the very clean, it's what you would expect from a dive-y type restaurant. I am a germaphobe and I still gave it 5 stars!I had the 6 egg southwestern omelet. &#160;Next went back and conquered the 12 egg omelet. For 12 eggs the omelet wasn't that expensive. &#160;Family got biscuits and gravy, French toast, and a giant pancake. All were very good. The hash-browns were a family favorite. We had to order extra. &#160;Even though it was for breakfast, we got milkshakes: Peanut butter (my favorite) and chocolate (typical).The service wasn't anything special, in fact when I ordered the 12 egg omelet the lady practically rolled her eyes at me. &#160;Most of the servers acted very busy and annoyed but some were friendly. &#160;The rudeness wasn't anything I haven't seen at other restaurants. &#160;The good and the bad work everywhere.I would recommend this place to anyone with an open mind and a taste for breakfast. &#160;Just be aware, parking can be difficult as it's right off a main road without a lot. I am trying not to let the fact that I was stood up here sour my review. ;)Beth's is a must do for any Seattleite. People crawl here, taxi here, walk here from every bar in town and it does deliver. The place is an experience on its own.I wandered in sober, so I was already out of place. Staff is all very helpful and friendly, and the cooks are working fast and hard to keep up with a packed house. Wait for a table can be as long as 30 minutes, and everyone in your party must be present in order to snag one. I should mention that they did break this rule for me. By the time I'd been there an hour, I think this was due to pity.When I finally ordered, everything came out to perfection. The wait for food is a bit long, but very understandable. Bacon was crisp, toast was buttered, hash browns are HUGE, and egg was delicious. I loved their black tea, which came out with honey and a lemon (without me asking) and was refilled with hot water very promptly.Perks: a game room with rifle shooting game, old style arcade, and two pinball machines, friendly and helpful staff, no-frills atmosphere and payment (pay at the counter after you are finished eating), crayons and paper to color while you wait.I will venture back in! Beth's has made quite a reputation off of its 12-egg omelettes and just being a greasy spoon diner in general, which is cool and all, but nothing special enough to pull me back in for a $30 breakfast for two. We were promptly seated after walking in at 11 am on a Wednesday morning but it was 10-15 minutes before we even got another glance or a glass of water. We got the 6-egg triple bypass omelette, which in itself would have been more than enough to feed two people, but I forgot about Beth's constantly-touted giant portion sizes so I went ahead and ordered a belgian waffle with eggs and sausages. Everything tasted decent but for the price, I could have just cracked a bunch of eggs and added a crapload of salt and fat and ended up with a similar result. The fun part of Beth's, though (which I'm sure would be extra-entertaining to drunk people late at night), is that every table is offered crayons and white paper for coloring while waiting for their food. If you're intoxicated and super hungry and have more than a few dollars in your pocket, Beth's would probably be a great choice...otherwise, you'd probably be better off going to another breakfast joint or even just cooking up some pancakes and eggs at home. Once in a long while when I crave real big breakfast meal, I think of Beth's Cafe. The place is not expensive, serves a large portion (they definitely don't skimp!) and, best of all, I can count on it being open at any time of the day. I personally like this place more than 13 coins (unless you are looking for non-breakfast selection), just because Beth's Cafe is really a local spot (with cheaper prices) and I do want to support a local establishment over a chain restaurant.The food is good and definitely greasy to breakfast foodie's satisfaction (which is why I only try to think of it once every long while!!) but is definitely a good comfort food to eat when you are sad, happy or just for any moments. My favorite is, biscuits with gravy (which comes with 2 eggs, hashbrowns, toasts and jam). I did try to ask for "poached eggs" when they asked how I'd like my eggs cook...and they politely told me..they don't do poached eggs. So I guess I just end up with a greasier option like fried sunny side up eggs with running yolks instead..who am I to cut down on grease, right?Be careful showing up on weekend mornings though. I drive by Beth's Cafe in the morning sometimes and they seem to always have a long line coming out of the restaurants during tha ttime (it's breakfast time, duh....). Featured on TV's "Man vs. Food", this place is 100% dive diner-esk located right on Aurora and one block off of Green Lake. The portions are extremely large and can be easily shared by two people. The service was mediocre, but friendly. Great egg scrambles. When they give you the menu, they also give you some paper and crayons so you can draw a picture and hang it on the wall. In fact, the walls are covered with various pictures of all sorts...all drawn by adults. My favorite was a picture of a salt and pepper shaker with a bottle of Tobasco titled "The Three Amigos".Um....yeah, there's food here to, mostly of the breakfast variety. Very tasty and HUGE proportion sizes. Do not come here if you are on a diet. Their 6 egg omelet... what's there to say? It's insane!! But in a brilliantly good way.It's one of the few dishes I'd indulge, say, once a month (since I'm from the hippy city of Vancouver up north). I could literally feel my arteries clogging up from this dish. . I can't argue to the beauty of bacon fat. No one should. Yet this friendly breakfast cafe is usually all anyone can ask for after a long lost week at work. First off, the location is great. Beth's is a short distance from Green Lake and its walking/biking path, so it's in the perfect place to walk off a large meal, especially when the weather's nice. Second, the dishes were delicious and creative, but ultimately I could make most of this stuff at my own house. I had the Northwestern Exposure (a smoked salmon and cream cheese omelet) and my friend had the Southwestern Exposure (a chili omelet seasoned with house spices). They were both satisfying, generous portions, but if you're looking for something new and off the charts, this isn't the place for you. If you want some good quality homemade meals, then stop on by.The omelets were served on hash browns that were crispy in some places and soft in others, creating the perfect side dish. Really, the hash browns here are heaven.The salmon had good flavor but it was overshadowed by the huge globs of cream cheese. A spiced cream cheese might have helped complement the salmon or the eggs.The dish, as I had it, might as well have been called the cream cheese omelet with some salmon. It was good, just overdone.My friend had the Southwestern Exposure (a chili omelet). He swears by this dish, and he orders it every time he comes to Beth's. I had a bite and I wish I had ordered that. Even though I could make my own chili omelet at home, I'd definitely pay to have this one again.Third, the service was spotty when I visited. Two of four employees on duty loudly complained about hating their job, and it felt like no one gave a damn that we were there. When my server barely speaks to me in sentences, I always think twice about leaving a generous tip.Overall I feel that Beth's, despite all my criticisms, is worth repeated visits. When i eat breakfast anymorei will forever make comparisons to the glutenous 12 egg omelette i tried to devour made a futile attempt for being a 5 foot 7 inch short fat asian man! &#160;Im just jealous and envious of anyone who can out eat me since im a self-proclaimed big eater. &#160;Thanks Beth for bringing me back down to earth! Great dining experience with attentive serviceAmazing house coffeeThe Best set of Crayola crayons for us to draw and post on their famed wallDefinite Dining experience for any touristAlso Pinball machines on site too which make it special to a kid at heart like myself Great omelet had the small six egg one stuffed with smoked salmon, &#160;cream cheese etc. &#160;delicious, a huge plate of food. If you want a huge plate of food this is the place for you.... Check the art work of the diners. The coolest dive in Seattle. They are open 24 hours 7 days a week and I'm fairly sure they are only closed on Christmas day. The servers may have poor attitudes but I think thats the appeal and expectation there. The majority of their customers are coming from bars... That being said they are NOT just another greasy spoon diner. They make the best breakfast food you can find in Washington. The hashbrowns are seriously so good. Perfect amount of crunchy crisp and greasy potato. The bacon is always cooked to perfection and the Friendship bread is out of this world. All for about 10$. You cant go wrong. Theyve also got some pretty rad hot chocolate if thats your kind of thing.Be forewarned that the only time Beths is at its best is between 10pm and 4am though. Thats when the best cook is working. And you may have to wait awhile as this place is pretty popular. Its worth it though! Be patient :) Ok. Went there with my girl this last saturday after a movie. Got the 6 egg ham and cheddar(forgot what the hell they called it). Our server(whos name started with an S, again forgot) was awesome, and attentive in spite of it being pretty busy. The only reason that i'm lowering the rating here is because of one of the cooks. Again. The food was good. But it was the stuff he was talking about while he was cooking my fucking food. Spouting off about having STD's. Then a dog came in the front door, and he said "hey there doggy, if your looking for diarrhea you came to the right place!!!". Now let me be clear. I love Beths. That place is the spot, mainly because of the atmosphere, and how it's such a reflection of the Seattle i grew up with and know and love. But there is only so much room for talk like that from the dude who is COOKING YOUR FUCKING FOOD. It's gonna take a lot more then that for me not to go to Beths. But i did consider telling them i wasn't going to pay for a meal made by a dude who procalimed to have multiple STDs. Came here and got the Country Eggs Benedict. In short, it was DELICIOUS! I am not the biggest sausage fan, but I decided to be adventurous, and ended up polishing it off. When we first arrived we were told by the (super friendly) staff there was a little bit of a wait. Maybe fifteen minutes, to be expected... Beth's isn't the biggest place.The only thing that I can say negative about Beth's is the cleanliness. We sat all the way in the last booth by the cook, and got a wonderful view of the disgusting dirty floor all while feeling crumbs of whatever that was left on the seat. And if you look closely, you'll probably see that the "artwork" is covering up some sort of splatter on the wall. Nothing was in my food though, and I guess that's what matters...Food: 4 starsCleanliness: 1 star Beth's Cafe - the concept is good, the food could be better. &#160;I enjoyed my 12 egg Southwestern Exposure omelette overall, but it was much more quantity than quality. I know that quantity is the point of Beth's, but they really could up their score with a little more attention to ingredient quality and omelette structure. &#160;The hash brown base of the omelette destroys the flavor to a degree. &#160;I would prefer the hash browns on the side instead. &#160;The place could also be cleaner, but I agree that a sparkling place would ruin the vibe. &#160;All in all, I enjoyed Beth's and will be back again. Beths is always delicious and a fun place to go eat! Went here for a later bite last night and its always enjoyable to look at everyones drawings all over the wall definitely entertainment! Big and well worth it meals but they also offer mini breakfast options which is what I go for and it is just as good and hearty as the regular portions! It is great that Beth's is always open and &#160;every once and awhile when we want that late night bite, Beth's pops to the top of the list! I'll admit, this place is probably the best thing ever.. when intoxicated. Tons of greasy, deep friend, calorie dense food options to choose from &amp; the portions are always huge. Not to mention it is open 24 hours.However, when not intoxicated this place is slightly awful. Average food at best, nothing I couldn't get for a lot cheaper then they charge, the place itself is a little dirty &amp; the staff is quite interesting.. to say the least. Not going to lie &amp; say I won't return, smashed, at 3am, to stuff my face. MMMM it is ok, i like the extended hours here and the food is ok. You can be waiting awhile to get in some late nights and it is kinda dirty and hard to find a place to park. The 12 egg Omelet is fun to share with another person but, it is not a place I crave. Not gunna lie - I liked this place quite a lot!The decor left a lot to be desired. &#160;The walls are covered with childrens art, nothing is new, very very hole in the wall, but once you get past that it's pretty great!I had the chocolate milkshake to start and OMG it was awesome - SO DELICIOUS!!! &#160;My fiance had the peanut butter milkshake - he loved it!For my entree I had the pancakes, scrambled eggs, and ham. &#160;The pancakes were HUMONGOUS!! &#160;Very glad I didn't opt for an extra pancake lol. &#160;It was very delicious though. &#160;The scrambled eggs were fine - normal eggs. &#160;The ham was fantastic though!My fiance had the ruben - he said it was good, not great.Overall - pretty great place! &#160;I liked it, we'll be back. The Triple bypass plus chili is the ultimate guilty pleasure! plus it makes the best leftovers. Ill order a 12 egg omelet and happily eat it for the next few days. and the friendship bread and jam is unreal. the night me and my buddies found Beth's we spent the rest of the night trying to find a grocery store that sold that same jam. Luckily we found it. I'm not sure what it's like for breakfast or brunch but I thoroughly enjoyed coming here for a late night dinner. &#160;The restaurant itself is very quaint and their selection of foods is crazy. &#160;I split a 12 egg omelet with three other people and I was beyond filled. &#160;The 12 egg omelet also comes with unlimited hash browns which is nice if that somehow doesn't fill you. &#160;It seems like a great place to get a late night snack with friends. &#160;Little extra: they post your drawings on the wall which is cute (although some of the drawings were rather disturbing) Beth's Cafe has good food. The famous 12 egg omelette was everything it was stacked up to be, and the Belgian Waffle was fluffy, yummy, and the blueberry sauce- delish. We had the "Northwestern" omelette. YUM. At first I was skeptical of how smoked salmon, cream cheese and green onions would taste in an omelette- but my doubts were laid to rest with the first bite. The hash browns were decent- but what can taste bad soaked in 2 sticks of butter? I've had better, I've had worse. They could use a kick up on the crispiness scale.Overall, Food-YUM, Prices-not horrible for a place with so much buzz. (around $20 for 12 egg omelette), Service- a letdown. the server seemed a little distracted, and never came to our table after we got our food.It's a fun place- go there for the yummy, hearty food and funky place. Who isn't a fan of breakfast?!I've been here a couple times after a long walk at Green Lake Park or just in the area and wanting some good food. It's also nice that it's open 24 hrs :)You can't go wrong with their 12 egg omelette but their blueberry french toast is pretty darn good too mmmWhat makes this place most unique is that people who visit this place have the opportunity to make their mark by drawing a picture and posting it on the walls. It's cool to see the different pictures on the walls. THERE ARE A LOT but it's a good thing.So if you're hungry and have some creative juices flowing, make a trip here and post your art on the walls. You never know what you'll find in there :D I have been a Washington resident for over 30 years and Beth's is one of my favorite places to eat breakfast.After watching the episode of Man v. Food that showed Adam Richman attempting to eat a 12-egg omelette, I have repeatedly challenged myself to see if I could consume a 6-egg omelette. &#160;To date, I have been unsuccessful.Since December, I have been sweating it out in Phoenix, Arizona. &#160;I just flew back to Seattle last night and the first thing I did was drive over to Beth's and order a Southwestern Exposure omelette.This place is one of the best there is. &#160;Just gimme a slice of Friendship Bread and I'm happy. Do I feel that my ability is compromised, that time has dulled my memories, that my senses look fondly upon a place I would not view with such appreciation should I cross the threshold today, simply because I have not eaten at Beth's in over a decade? No, but yes, but no! Founded in 1954? The Yelp was not. I was not. But Beth's was! And then I was, and then the Internet, and then the Yelp. So I have no qualms about remembering Beth's as Beth's is. Before the fire of '98, after the fire of '98, always with good, good food. Food for the soul, weary with the crises of the young at 4am. Food for the body, battered by substances foreign and domestic. Good for the memories, fond reflections still cherished. Good like home. Good like family. Good like Beth's. Interesting atmosphere. There are colored coloring sheets and crayon colored pictures all over the restaurant walls. Very different breakfast restaurant I would say. The workers seem to be super hipster and different from the people I've met in Seattle. &#160;I came in because of all the interesting reviews I saw before coming into the restaurant from out of state so I was expecting much, especially seeing featured episode of the restaurant on T.V.HUGE portions for their price. I got the unlimited hash brown deal and the first batch was slightly too soft and not crispy enough for my taste. The second batched I asked for it crispier! It was a little tad bit too greasy for my taste but still really yummy! Very good breakfast food! Bacon was perfect and I can't wait to try their 6 egg omelet and pancakes next time~I can't wait to get back once I'm back in Seattle. Very awesome breakfast and lots of it also. Great place for brunch. Be prepared to wait for at least 30minutes. They have really good hashbrowns and egg dishes. However the chicken fried steak was nasty. Avoid!We went there to get our biscuits and gravy fix however we left unsatisfied. The gravy was pasty, plain and cold. Next time I think I'll stay at home for biscuits and gravy.Everything comes out really greasy overall so I don't think it's a weekly weekend dive. More like a lets-find-somewhere-interesting-to-pig-out place. I usually come here after going out at clubs because you you're hungry. My favorite thing to.do here is draw while I eat reminds me when I was kid in the Philippines *good times* anyway breakfast here is just fantastic and food is always great I'm never dissapointed. Come get your breakfast on : ) Most definitely one of the best dives in the country for breakfast as proved by being featured on so many food shows. &#160;We visited after being gone from the NW for 12 years and it's exactly the same - YAY!Our family breakfast out didn't disappoint. &#160;The size of the meals is still humongous and well prepared. We had a 12 egg omelet at our table and two 6 egg omelette's that were devoured! &#160; I had the hash - it didnt disappoint - homemade and crispy. &#160;Good coffee, great service, fun and uncensored customer art on the walls. &#160;We will always LOVE Beth's and return on each visit back to the NW. I have friends that are Seattle natives that have gone to this restaurant for decades.The food itself is decent. We split the north western 12-egg omelette (Smoked Salmon, cream cheese, green onions) and a blueberry waffle.The Omelette was $20 and they charge you a $1.50 for each additional plate/person you share with, because the Omelette comes with all you can eat hashbrowns. The Omelette was quite good. It contained plenty of Salmon, a lot of cream cheese and was cooked in what seemed like half a stick of butter. The hashbrowns are soft instead of crispy and are also drenched in butter.The blueberry waffle is packed with spices. There seemed to be nutmeg in the batter and the top layer is drenched in blueberries and whip cream.The food itself is normal diner food and is priced fairly high due to the exposure it has gotten from the Travel Channel (Man vs. Food). There isn't even a prize if you finish the 12-egg Omelette.The main reason why the score is so low, is due to the fairly high price and mainly the service. As a former waiter, I was very disappointed with the service. She only came to take our order and to deliver our food. We had to ask a different waiter for another helping of all you can eat hasbrowns and a different waiter for our check. Just because we have six people and that you already charged us for gratuity does not mean that you can abandon our table. Great breafast joint food was very good service as well. &#160;The table in front of the game room is tight but they all looked tight I mean I am not a heavy person but the distance from the edge of the table to my chest was two inches. DO NOT GET STUCK AT THAT TABLE. &#160;But if you do that's no so bad there is a cat in the service station where the buss boys area would be and SHE meyaus meyau meyau her whole shift A Seattle establishment for over 50 years, Beth's Cafe has been making customers happy with their enormous omelettes and "all-you-can-eat" hashbrowns. The staff is always ready to greet you with a smile, and the walls decorated with customers' drawings create a laid-back and unique atmosphere. A large menu offers a variety of options, from french toast and pancakes to biscuits and gravy, as well as non-breakfast options as well. &#160;Regardless of what you choose to eat *cough.cough.triple-bypass*,Beth's is sure to satiate your appetite for a warm, tasty meal. First thing you need to know about this place is that it is a total dive - so if that isn't your thing - for one you would be missing out on some seriously good eats, but also that you should really consider expanding your horizons. &#160;I went here with a friend today for her birthday - she has been coming to Beth's for years but it was my first time and I believe I have found my new heaven. &#160;She had the 6-egg omlette that looked like it had 12 eggs in it - it was huge but very tasty. &#160;I had the breakfast burrito - why not have all your favs wrapped in a tortilla? &#160;The burrito I got had cheese, sausage, hash browns, eggs, and salsa in it. &#160;I got black beans on the side which really rounds out the flavor as well. &#160;I will absolutely be bringing my husband to this place - definitely a great find.This place is open 24 hours so that is definitely a plus, especially if you are a student - I will admit the parking situation can be a little iffy and I have heard that the wait can be substantial sometimes, but trust me - this place and the people who work there are totally worth it. Went in there last night (Saturday) at around 1am and waited around an hour for a table, the service seemed pretty slow even though it didn't seem as busy as it was while we were waiting....Our waitress was super sweet and my grilled cheese and tomato sandwich was yummy! The lighting is a bit bright (flourescent) :-( and the music was a little too loud, but I always wanted to go there because I know that it is a Seattle staple and it was still fun because of all of the art on the wall and the fun patrons......Maybe I will sit in the middle room the next time we go, the lighting doesn't seem as bright. :-) The only reason I would ever go back here is to cheer someone on trying to eat the 12 egg omelette. &#160;The food is average on a good day, and the service sucks. &#160;Plus, I had to basically clean my silverware myself before using it. &#160;Further to that, if you are going to attempt the 12 egg omelette challenge, don't be fooled into thinking you will win a shirt or a free meal. &#160;Nope! &#160;That was all made up for the show. &#160;As a matter of fact, they really don't even acknowledge that you may be trying to beat 'Man vs Food', and do not give any credit to the show that, in my opinion, has kept this place going. I was visiting a friend in Seattle and I had seen this place featured on Man vs Food, so I said we should check it out. &#160;I got the 6 egg Southwestern Exposure omelet and it was amazing.I wasn't able to finish it in one sitting much to my dismay, but it was a great snack a day or so later. &#160;I found the hash browns to be perfect and the toast was also tasty. Also crayons and paper at your disposal!!!I can't wait to go back. I wanted to try this place out because it was on Man vs Food. The food was average. Not the homecoming style I was looking for. eggs had hardly any seasonings, hash browns were burnt on top and undercooked in the middle. Everything else was ok. Your basically buying the portion size. You get a lot for your money here. It is a nice change of place, but it was a little dirty for me. Good experience though. Beth's Cafe is famous for huge portions at reasonable prices. &#160;If that is what you are craving, you have come to the right place. &#160;The omelets come in two sizes, six or 12 egg. &#160;The other dishes are similar in size. &#160;To make things even more crazy, they come with all you can eat hash browns. &#160;Overall, the food was pretty good, not great. &#160;The hash browns were the star for me. &#160;This place was opened in 1954 and looks like it. &#160;I think it adds to the charm, though others may just think it looks old. This place is great, the food is fabulous.The service isn't that great and the wait times are TERRIBLE.DO NOT go on a Saturday, last night we waited outside over an hour to be seated and eventually left because it was so crazy!Any other night its usually okay. I still give it 4 stars because the food is just great and its 24 hours. The help is okay, I don't really know why. I am not a fan of their burgers or their fries. I love splitting a 12 egg omelet. The Alaskan salmon one is soooo delicious. I've gotten it a few time and it tasted burnt once but, the other times it has been quite delicious. The friendship bread is to die for as well. I give it 4 stars in spite of all of that because of the value of food you're getting and the gorrrrrrgeous waitresses that they have working there. Oh mama. Don't expect a regular Sunday brunch with the grandparents kind of experience here, it's so much more. Drawing by customers on the wall, small table, half torn menu, tight space and an open kitchen- you get the idea. Expect wait on weekends. A great late night dining venue as well due to the open 24 hrs factor.Last time I came here with 3 other people we all shared the 12 eggs omelet and went home very happy and full. Also, the all you can eat hash brown is pretty awesome. &#160;Overall a decent place but there are definitely better breakfast/brunch joints around Seattle. Best place to get a 12 egg omelete and a pint. &#160;Period. This is the place you want to take friends or family from outside of Seattle, because it is so unique. My son saw an episode of "Regular Show" where they had a 12-egg omelet challenge and I told him "you know, we have such a thing for real, here in Seattle", so we took him there. We "only" took on the 6-egg omelet and yet, even with sharing, it was a massive breakfast. The hash browns that come with the omelet are pretty tasty.It's not necessarily for you if you are on a weight-loss diet, but I have seen Beth's Cafe a couple of times on TV and when you know what you can expect, you will not be disappointed. I am looking forward for the next time to take on their humongous breakfast burritos. Some of the best food in town, great prices, the people there treat you like you have been coming there for years, and the decor is a tattoo artists dream gotta love this place!! Well, I'd seen the Man Vs Food episode with Beth's Cafe @ Greenlake... as well as in the "1,000 Places to Eat/Go before you die" &#160; It was Sunday morning-ish and we where all STARVING... so we made the treck from Lake Stevens To Greenlake... Stood in line for about 45 minutes wating for a table... (party of 6), got seated, ordered... and then just stuffed our faces. &#160;FOOD COMA. &#160;We got a 12 Egg omlet for the table to split, an order of Biscuts &amp; gravy, my friend and I got a chicken fried steak to split... we all decided it was a food buffet and shared everything with everyone at the table. &#160;WOW. &#160;We are big eaters, we where STARVING, and we still walked out of Beths with TWO doggie bags! &#160;The unlimited hash browns when you order the 12 egg omlet is THE BEST PART... as their's are cooked to perfection! &#160;Ask for the bacon extra crispy and it's perfect every time! &#160;:) &#160;IF you have room after all of that, take the time to get an order of Amish freindship bread... &#160;:) &#160;Service is swift, curtious and very good! Decided to give Beth's a try after seeing it on a program that listed it as one of the best dinners in America. &#160;My family went ahead and decided to share one of there 12 egg omelets. Food was OK. Not terrible by any means but &#160;I doubt I would go back. The wait was almost a full hr. The workers here are all incredibly hot. Clint, an attractive man of about 29 (just an estimation) is especially terrific. I feel honored to be in the presence of there cooks and I am dumbfounded when I speak to the all knowing Vedo. In addition to them, Sascha, Arsen and Wookie inspire me to be a better Seattle citizen. Eat the Boner sandwich. I mean bagel sandwich. Also Liz is the only person on the face of the planet who can pull off those hats. Beth's Cafe is some great breakfast food! &#160;They do not have anything unsual, just omlettes and other egg dishes, pancakes or french toast, those sorts of things. &#160;But everything they do, they do well. If you're in for an adventurous mood, then by any means come by this place. The food is alright but a little too greasy for my taste. The service is okay, could do better to pay attention to their customers. I don't get a chance to get by here much mainly due to distance. But I have to say I LOVE Beths! I know there are mixed reviews and I will say this...I WILL go to Beth's before I would go to Denny's. I like that fact that the walls are covered in all kinds of drawings and artistry. I like the fact that laid back chill folks are sitting there nomming on their chocolate cakes and omelets at 12am. When you go to this kind of establishment hang your pride outside...it's not some fancy schmancy joint that's going to cater to your over extended palate. It is what it is and it's good. Simple as that. I like the fact that my waitress sat down at my table and engaged me in conversation. Would I expect this at a regular restaurant? NO...I expect it only at Beth's and ONLY at Beth's is this acceptable. I enjoy the food, the portions, the atmosphere, the history, and the shit paint job! I liked my greasy eggs, my hashbrowns and my sausage! Haven't been here in a few years but always was happy with my meal. First visited in 1975 as a newly transplanted east coaster. Was amazed, 30 years later introduced my son who was at the U to it. He brought my daughter and all his friends, Best thing other than the food and funky drawings is the toilet in the bathroom. A true throne.
I wish this place had a soup and half-sandwich special. If you go alone, that presents a dilemma: Sandwich or chowder? Chowder or sandwich? Decisions, decisions...You could spring for both (about $15), but I'd advise that you go with a pal and split a crab roll and a bowl of chowder. The roll itself is only so-so, but you get a HEAP of fresh crab that postively spills out of the roll. Plus lettuce, celery, and a zesty cocktail sauce on the side. I'm partial to the original clam chowder, but they usually have about six kinds on offer (including a seared scallop with dill that's pretty tasty, too).For the record? When I go alone, I fret until it's time to order then get the crab roll every time... Best Chowder in Seattle. &#160;Beats out Duke's, definately beats out Ivar's.Get the sampler to try new stuff, or just get the standard white chowder in a bread bowl. &#160;The salads are stupid, not worth it... but I can't seem to make a meal out of just clam chowder, bread bowl, and a diet pepsi.Seating is annoying, since the place is super crowded and close together. &#160;Get a seat, eat, and be merry. &#160;If you sit outside, it's not bad too. &#160;But if it's during the winter, opening/closing the door to that plaza sends a burst of wind in the place.One of the many great little places to get food in Pike Place market. &#160;This is the place for warm-you-up food.
Wow, I just discovered this little gem. &#160;I had the steak and brisket pho to go! &#160;(Friend was sick, so thought I would give it a try. &#160;I usually go the Mexican meat market next door.) &#160;I have to say, the pho was terrific. &#160;The broth was tasty, but had a mellow and almost cinnamon taste to it. &#160;The whole to-go presentation was nicely laid out in the box. As for cleaniless, I thought the place very clean. Clean. fast service. yummy food. great prices. If you want food and you want it right away, this is a place to go in and out, fast! One of the better location for pho in White Center. I usually order Pho Dac Biet. Fresh ingredients and friendly service. The location is a bit "ghetto" due to the fact that it's right in front of the main bus stops in White Center. Favorite place for pho in white center . It's good if you want pho but I recommend eating quick because it's in a sketchy neighborhood and is pretty old inside . The owner is really nice and I don't know how he puts up with the sketchy ppl who come in , he deserves a better location.
Giving this place 5 stars is a bit excessive when you have to pay $95/person and then have to pay extra if you want the special catch of the day or any of the other 2 desserts on the menu, such as the chocolate lava cake. &#160;Basically, for $95 your dinner and tip is included. &#160;However, what they don't tell you until you get on the boat and look at the menu is that none of the appetizers are included in that fee, 2 out of the 5 main courses are not included in that fee and only 1 of the 3 desserts are included in that fee (cheesecake). &#160;You also get a choice of seafood chowder or a salad with raisins and oranges and candied walnuts in it. &#160;I opted for the chowder because fruit in my salad is not a salad to me. &#160;In addition, if you want ANY sides to your main course, such as sauteed mushrooms, scampi prawns, or 1/2 lb of king crab legs, expect to pay extra on top of the $95 you already paid. &#160;That's a total scam if you ask me. &#160;If $95 includes your meal, EVERYTHING on the menu should be included in the price. &#160;The choices of the main courses weren't even that good (vegetable ravioli, chicken with crab on top or salmon). &#160;What if you want beef? &#160;Well you have to pay extra, which I did for a steak. &#160;Our waiter only had to wait on 5 tables, yet he was slower than slow and was not helpful in any way. &#160;We had to ask for someone to come over to take our drink order and all the other tables ordered their main course while we were eating our appetizers. &#160;We probably waited 30 minutes before our food even came out. &#160;We constantly had to ask for more hot water for my parents' tea and refills on coke, etc. &#160;In addition to that, our soups and appetizers were lukewarm. &#160;There was a live band on board, but they sang a lot of cheesey songs. &#160;I will say that the woman performer was good and much better to listen to than the male singer. &#160;It was also nice that she went around to every table to acknowledge any special occassions/celebrations. &#160;The two stars are for the fact that we did have a nice view of the city, even if the Captain never told us what we were looking at. &#160;The other star is for the fact that the band did play a song for my parents' anniversary and they got to do the Cha Cha Cha on the dancefloor and show up the stiff couple on the dancefloor.The food wasn't terrible, but for more than $95/person, you can get an amazing meal at a place like Ruth's Chris and at least you know what you get going into it. &#160;It was an experience and I was with my family so we made the most of it, but otherwise, I wouldn't waste my money on something like this.
Great fresh cooked food, delicious. This small intimate joint is real food! I love the fish, goat and my favorite is an appetizer NEMS!!!! Delicious! AFFORDABLE! GOOD EATS! Awesome. I am not a lamb fan, but Mamdou talked me into it and it was fantastic! It was in some type of carrot based cream sauce, which sounds crazy, but was also amazing. I recommend strongly. I have no other experience with Sengalese food so I have no comparison. But, I know that the food and drinks here are delicious! &#160;The owner/chef was super friendly and chatted with us about Sengalese culture. &#160;Try it out when you're feeling adventurous! Fantastic flavors, very friendly staff and very clean. The lamb was meaty and fall off the bone and the chicken had an amazing sauce. I will definitely be back.
Absolutely the best dogs in town. &#160;The delicious smell of grilled sausage and toasted buns wafts criminally into the crisp park air and makes your mouth water and stomach rumble regardless of what time it is.Complementary grilled cabbage is a rare and welcome addition to the wide variety of dog options sold here. &#160;The $2.75 all beef hot dog special is amazing. &#160;Pile on the chopped onions, sour kraut, and relish yourself from the gratis condiments bar and revel in the moment.One note: &#160;the Yelp map screenshot is incorrect. &#160;The actual stand is located on a building corner right along the edge of Westlake Park (across from Westlake Center). &#160;Scoot the marker about two blocks south and follow the scent of perfectly grilled meat.
I work next door to this place and have been watching the construction happen for months now. I've lurked peeping in any hole in the paper they had over the windows anxiously awaiting what was to come. Today it opened and while anything was going to be better than the pita pit that once existed here I had no idea it would be this awesome.I love japanese food. I would eat it all the time if I could and now I can! 4:00 came today and U:Don opened it's doors. I headed over filled with wonderment. I was like a child in front of a christmas tree with a bunch of presents under it. Anyhow, I'm getting carried away...There are a bunch of different kinds of udon you can pick from. Most of which are vegetarian. YES! I chose the Kitsune Udon which has fried tofu floating on top of it looking so delicious. It smells as good as it looks as well. Mmmm. I couldn't just stop there. I had to sample as many things as I could get my little mitts on. I wandered towards the tempura bar. YES there is a tempura bar, hungry yelpers! I plucked from the bar a small smattering of what was offered. I grabbed a stick of little mushrooms, a potato croquet and just for kicks a tempura soft boiled egg. I took all of my goodies to the counter and paid the man for my udon, tempura snacks and a fountain soda. They have JONES FROM THE FOUNTAIN!!! All of these things cost me around $12. A deal on the Ave. They also offer complimentary condiments to take with you that include mayo and this delicious kind of almost teriyaki sauce for your dipping enjoyment. Also, all of the employees were really really sweet and more than helpful in my first time U:Don confusion. These guys know what they're doing. The soup broth was delicious and flavorful. The tofu was perfectly sweet. The udon was amazing and super fresh tasting. The tempura was also so freaking delicious. The potato croquet especially. With the sauce.. So good! The egg, I didn't know what I was to expect but it was also wonderful! Across the board a five star experience. I will be back. Probably every day since I just have to go next door. NOM NOM NOM. (ps. it's really cute and clean in there.) I went here for the first time today and I loved it. &#160;The atmosphere, the people, and the food are all wonderful. &#160;The noodles are perfect in texture and taste and you get to watch them make em so you know they are fresh! &#160;the soup broth on its own is really flavorful, the added green onion and ginger paste you can choose to add really gives it a kick. &#160;The tempura there is also nice and crispy the shrimp and chicken were especially good and there was a huge selection of different veggies. &#160;The medium soup is actually surprisingly filling, I ended up having some left overs which is saying something. &#160;I look forward to frequenting U:don. Really delicious! &#160;I am new to Japanese ramen- I love Samurai Noodle in the ID, so I wanted to try this place. &#160;It's very clean/organized and the decor is nice for a U-District joint. &#160;The staff is very friendly &amp; warm. &#160;You pass the open kitchen as you take a tray down the line, ordering your soup from the chef in the size you want, then picking out which which fresh tempura (or other items) you would like- serving yourself on a separate plate. &#160;The broth on the dish I had was great, and the noodles were perfect. &#160;I was thrilled I could opt out of fresh ginger- nice that the soup is made to order in front of you. &#160;I had the Niku Udon and tempura sweet potato &amp; kiraage chicken. &#160;Definitely try the Karaage chicken! &#160;I didn't feel weighed down after eating my small bowl, it was just perfect. &#160;Thumbs up up! &#160;Too bad I don't work down the street anymore, U:Don would have been a great option. U:Don is a new joint located right along the Ave in Seattle's U-District. It's been newly remodeled and has a clean, aesthetic, definitively Japanese look. U:Don is unique in having one of the only Udon noodle making machines in the city. For those of you who don't know, udon is one of the most popular Japanese quick eats. Well, how does U:Don compare in the pantheon of eateries around the world? Well, FANTASTICALLY, I must say. U:Don provides spectacular fresh noodles, the base of the food, and fine embellishments, including curry preparations, braised, meats, and tempura. Add some cute, fantastic desserts, a Jones Soda dispenser, and an assortment of teas, all at a very reasonable price, and you have a delicious, tasty, filling, new foodie experience of the most veteren of you Seattle foodies out there! U:Don has arrived, and in grand style. Go check in out, grab a fast lunch, or sit down for a casual dinner, and you will be pleased. Chef Tak Kurachi has done a wonderful job with place, and I suspect it will be around for a long time to grace Seattle's ecclectic palate. Fantastic option, especially if you are in or near the U District or are craving a fun, Japanase culinary experience. Highly recommended
Using a deal from Tippr, I threw a surprise party at Ohana for my SO that included a flower lei and dessert of choice for the guest of honor, shell leis for everyone who came, a pu-pu platter, an order of Spam musubi, and a large order of edamame. While we waited for the guest of honor, we noshed on the pu-pu platter &amp; edamame, and took advantage of the great happy hour. The Blue Hawaiian drink is really massive and tasty,, and the pu-pu platter was great, the star was definitely the vegetable robata skewers. &#160;The edamame was very fresh. When the guest of honor arrived, they promptly put the flower lei around his neck, it was made of orchids and tuberose, it smelled really good and was very fresh.We ordered a bunch of handrolls from the happy hour menu, they were delivered promptly after being made, the seaweed was still crunchy, and probably some of the better handrolls I've had. &#160;We really enjoyed the food, though I thought the Kahlua Pork could've used a little more flavor. But man, that Lava Flow drink kicked serious ass, it's so tropical tasting, I wish they'd make it a lotion so I can smear it all over my body.The decor is like what TGI Friday wished it could be if it was a tiki bar, lots of knickknacks, lava lamps, and I think the other room had all kinds of fake flower vines on the ceiling.Service was excellent, the place seemed very busy, but the waiters were constantly filling our water glasses and were easy to find.Then as we were about to leave, the DJ started playing some awesome hip hop, we almost didn't leave. We had a great time and Ohana really helped make the surprise party work. Went in after work, had some good sushi, and spicy fried rice, the fried rice reminded me of Hawaii fried rice.. so that was a great thing!Spicy... had ham or spam in it, some veggies, was spicy.. yummm!Spider roll and dragon rolls &#160;very good even got someone who doesn't eat sushi to eat the spider roll, which is soft shell crab deep fried and rolled up w/cucumbers.Had rum -n- cokes.. very nice good and strong! Ohana Happy Hour is where it's at. $3 HH food including spam musubi, which is a plus definitely for me. The HH beef robata skewers (2), gyoza (6 pieces) and crunchy spicy tuna hand rolls are what make the Happy Hour so awesome. These are my favorite hand rolls in all of Seattle. And the pork gyoza is perfect - slightly crispy on the bottom and comes with an excellent dipping sauce (soy sauce, vinegar, chili oil, and I believe some red pepper flakes). Service is usually pretty good. The drinks specials are alright - $3 sake, $3 full sail rotator, and $5 'hawaiian iced tea' and blue hawaiians. It's one of my go-to Happy Hours in the city! Okay, maybe when I first came here it was on a really really bad night. I went here again last night, just for some drinks and the live hawaiian band. As I mention before I love all things hawaiian, and I just found out that they have live band here every Wednesday night. Guess where I'll be Wednesday nights from now on? :)I ordered a mai-tai, and unlike last time, this one was delicious! It went well with my Hennesy shot. I sipped my drinks while listening to the live music. It was a wonderful combo, I can't wait for next Wednesday. Anyone want to join?!Oh PS: I still wouldn't order food here though, it was bad last time, I don't know if I want to try it again. So I like this place cause I frequent it. But I don't like the people that come out after 10pm that make the place turn into a whole different kind of experience. So I suggest coming in before that and experience the dining side of Ohana. I like their happy hour, $3 food items, not just one thing and drink specials. The first Wednesday of every month at 9pm Ry from Po'okela Street Band plays. He does a great job of making the music to fit the atmosphere and the Hawaiian feel of the place. Their menu has a wide variety of Japanese style foods that can pretty much fulfill any &#160;craving you might be having in that department. I think Ohana does a great job fulfilling my cravings and doesn't break my bank to do so. I love Japanese food, and I love Hawaiian food.Ohana is filled with kitschy knick-knacks, which are fun to look at while you are waiting for your food/drinks.Ohana dishes out:- Friendly yet slow service.- Decent but not spectacular food (super small pieces of sushi and ordinary California rolls... OH! The miso soup was WAY too salty.)I think Ohana is a perfect Happy Hour place, but it is not one of those places I want to frequent (oh yeah, the parking is going to be pretty tough too.) I would probably give this place 4-stars if the service I received this past weekend hadn't been so crappy. The waiter was really uninterested and borderline rude. It wasn't very busy either so I think he could have been much more attentive. Anyway, onto the positive...I had the crunchy dynamite roll and OMG it was like heaven in my mouth. I don't think I've had such a delicious roll in such a long time. I was very pleased. It was on the "weekly specials" menu though, so I'm hoping it will be available the next time I come in because it was just TOO delicious. What rocked my socks the most was the bill. I wasn't keeping track of what things cost, but based on what was ordered, I was expecting to pay at least $20-30 more than what I did. Closest feel to being back home in Hawaii. &#160;Cool "Hawaii" vibe. &#160;Friendly staff...I will definitely visit again when I am back in Seattle. Ohana is a great place to grab some sushi and drinks - their happy hour is especially good. &#160;The food definitely has a bit of a Hawaiian style to it, but it's quite good. &#160;They have lots of great drink options with beers, sake, and some crazy tropical concotions too. &#160;The crowd is pretty cool and a lot of them seem to be regulars and plugged in with the staff. &#160;I'll have to come back WAY more often to get on that level!! I eat here every time I'm in Seattle. It was an accidental find, but an excellent one! The staff is really cool and helpful. All day night happy hour on Mondays and the place is always packed. sashimi is super fresh and the rolls on special are always a treat. Prices are decent for Seattle and I always leave fun and happy! Ohana was a great jewel of a restaurant I found while visiting Seattle this past weekend. &#160;My friend and I tried the pulled pork sandwich and it was to die for. &#160;It was the best sandwich I have hand in a long time. &#160;Sushi and beer was fantastic. &#160;I definitely will be going back when I'm visiting again. This is home for me...our favorite spot to start or to end the night or both.Great place for happy hour with good friends, great food, great service, wonderful music and great drinks.Love the live Hawaiian muisc on Wednesday...This place is like our Cheers.I recommend the Yellowtail Special with Tako, rice and some sake. &#160;You can order sushi or Hawaiian food such as Kulua Pork.This is place has a great vibe and energy to it, so you are always comfy. We came in just 15 minutes before the kitchen closed and right after the sushi bar cleaned up, but our waitress was very accommodating and insisted that we should order some food while we still could. We did, and it wasn't bad or great, so I plan on coming a little bit earlier into HH next time in order to try out their sushi.I strangely liked the music - it was loud R&amp;B and rap that brought me back to my middle school days (Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, what what!) mixed with some island tunes. It was open mic night for anyone and everyone who wanted to partake, and though no one from my group did so, it was nice to have the option.The HH drink menu was a bit on the short side, but for 4 bucks for a 16-oz Blue Hawaiian with a dainty umbrella? How could I resist one?Or....three...ha..ha..!! Just kidding! Like I'd drink that much...in public.. I love coming to Ohana especially for happy hour. My all time favorite roll is the "King and I roll". It's so refreshing and yummy. It's wrapped in a cucumber thinly sliced which replaces the rice. I could eat those everyday. The tempura is really good along with their teriyaki chicken. There is lots of Fu Fu drinks for you FuFu lovers. Ohana made a fun first date for me and my wife. Ok my friend's keep coming back to place. &#160;I hate it. &#160;I mean I like Ohana for what it is, but it's not worth coming here as often as my friends do. &#160;For a Bar - YES! I'm a fan! &#160;For the food, I have DEFINITELY had better. &#160;The math comes out to 3-stars for A-OK.The full-menu is a hit or miss, meaning, some items are decent and others are equivalent to your frozen food dinners. &#160;If you must, go with the sushi because at least the fish is relatively fresh. &#160;In addition, the entree selections are over-priced for the quality, taste and quantity.At first glance, the HH menu looks pleasing &#160;- $3 for all of the above including agedashi tofu, meat on a stick, and sushi rolls. &#160;But the bill racks up fast if you came in looking for a HH Meal. &#160;At least the rolls are quite tasty. &#160;The Spam Musubi is a good thing to order if your drinking and you need some solids to occupy the alcohol-filled-space in your tummy. &#160;The slice of spam gently blankets up a crap-load of rice.Now that I've bashed all I could about Ohana's food, their drinks are great! &#160;The bartenders and wait-staff are amazing and they move as fast-as their hands and feet will allow despite the crowd! &#160;The crowd is littered with islanders, yellow-fevered men, and all different kinds of Asians. &#160;When I come to Ohana for the drink, we mostly always have a good time at the bar. Always great for some quick sushi and spam musubi. &#160;Best part is you don't really have to wait in line even on Friday night. &#160;Service is always friendly and relatively quick. &#160;Again other than the spam musubi the rolls here are good quality(their spicy scallop is awesome) and reasonably priced; now onto something new I had...I've heard about loco moco from my friend who went to Hawaii. &#160;I've also heard about it from random TV shows so when I saw it on the menu and also saw it was the Braddah's favorite(Braddah Iz to be exact) I had to try it. &#160;Basically its a bowl of warm tasty comfort. &#160;Rice with a grilled(not fried) hamburger patty, topped with an egg and all smothered in gravy. &#160;I'm drooling just thinking about it; after a long week or on a cold night it is well a perfect meal to put a smile on your face. &#160;So to recap, go for the consistently good rolls and stay for the authentic Hawaiian cuisine. &#160;Next to try: nori wrapped mahi mahi(if I got the name right...). I'll be honest, I don't quite entirely remember that night, it was the last stop of many bars/restaurants....but I did enjoy the drinks and the food! I going based off of my buddy Chai posted and I had a Mai Tai which was good but I believe I ended up stealing Chai's Long Island by the end of the night :) Both, two thumbs up. It was quite tasty as was the spam musubi, fresh and hot. While the gyoza was hot and the dipping sauce was spicy and full of flavor. I would visit Ohana again in a heart beat, the food and drinks were worth the price and a fun atmosphere. I love this place. Live Hawaiian music (Wednesday nights) and happy hour food/drinks! Mmmmmm..... They also have mighty tasty spam musubi. 2 for $3 on happy hour! Yeahh! Food: 4.0 starsService: 4.0 starsAmbiance: 3.5 starsLocation: 3.5 starsPrice: 4.0 starsRecommendations: &#160;I would recommend getting the Katsu/Tonkatsu plate and Sumo Box with Chicken and Beef. &#160;The combination of plates will give you sampling of delicious meats and Hawaiian preparations. &#160;The chicken was moist and delicious and the beef was well prepared too. &#160;I was a little sad not to see Short Ribs on the menu but the food and ambiance made the meal at Ohana enjoyable.Overall: 4.0 starsMaybe it was influenced by the fact that I cant find Hawaiian food in Philadelphia and that I was craving it so much, but I definitely recommend Ohana for a delicious lunch/dinner with friends. &#160;Definitely has some room for improvement (menu and ambiance) but overall a good meal with friendly staff. Decent food all around, the pork BBQ was rather awesome. I went there several weeks ago for happy hour. I ordered the salmon skin roll which was okay, nothing big to crave about. Alcohol was pretty good and enjoyed it. The inside of the restaurant felt like i was at Island's Burgers but with a DJ. The food is usually decent however I probably will not go back due to the service. &#160;Everytime I go it seems like the staff are too busy for me or have an attitude. &#160;This place used to be my fav HH spot.....not anymore. Recently moved from Hawaii &#160;and only living literally 2 minutes away..i had to check this place out...This place is cool..not spectacular...just cool..reminds me of a few chessy places in Ohahu that I probely wouldnt go into but maybe once or twice but it works really well here...food is similar to what you might get in over on the islands...Sushi could use some work, place lunch is really good tho..live hawaiian music on Wens! good place to start off your night out in belltown with a good happy hour. Dj on weekends. After 10pm..it will get packed and super annoying...best to go early, down some drinks and move on. Fun place, the food is ok, just ok... Well, maybe not even that ok... But the the place is fun with good drinks... Don't go there expecting the best food of your life, just a fun time. I was really unimpressed by Ohana's happy hour. We went for Tuesday Trivia night (which was fun, I don't knock the trivia), &amp; on Tuesdays they have all evening HH. First of all, the happy hour menu that's actually available is much smaller than what's listed on their website. They have an amazing tropical drink menu, however NONE of it is part of their happy hour drink menu. There are a few $3 beers &amp; only two $5 cocktails that aren't even on their regular drink menu (i.e. they are weak &amp; crappy). Their food happy hour choices are super small portions - though they are "only" $3 you'll need at least 4 orders of the portions to make a light meal. Basically you should just order a regular portion off the regular menu, which has a lot more choices. Our waitress was really rude - she messed up the (small) order &amp; instead of just taking the incorrect food away ,she decided to talk back (goodbye tip).The miso salad dressing on the ohana salad is really delicious, so I recommend the salad. The tofu &amp; veggie robata was not good at all - the ginger sauce was bland and the coconut dipping sauce was overly sweet but had little other flavor. I went to Ohana again last week, and they have been somewhat redeemed.I ordered the sushi and sashimi lunch special, which was about $16 for a California roll, three pieces of nigiri, a few slices of sashimi and a miso soup. The fish was fresh and delicious with generous sized cuts, but I did have one piece of sashimi with a string of white fat in it and that kind of grossed me out. I do feel $16 was a bit pricy considering Japonessa's bento is $11 and Gamba's is also a bit cheaper.The service was friendly, a little overly in your face, but we received our food quickly and were well taken care of. I noticed their website no longer has any prices listed. I also really like that every table has five-spice and chili oil, which is a nice treat for miso and sushi. Went back to Ohana in Belltown, and had another gr8t meal there!! I,was so impressed with their friendllyness,and there service,and food that I, told them I'd be back again, and again. I,just love going there and the prices arn't that bad either. I'll be honest, not the best sushi but that would be the wrong reason to head to this joint. This place is warm, fun and the happy hour is KILLER. The service was awesome and the vibe was perfect. It wasn't too crowded but it wasn't creepy empty. It was our first time there and it happened to be trivia night. We did not win but we sure had fun trying. &#160;We ordered almost EVERYTHING off the happy hour menu and the Loco Moco off the regular menu. The HH stuff was decent but the Loco Moco tasted like burnt meat. But like I said, don't go here for high quality sushi. Do go here for good service, good vibes, great happy hour and to get your butt kicked in some trivia! I'm a definite fan!Love the eclectic style this restaurant has to offer.A mixture of Pan-Asian cuisines from Hawaiian, Filipino, Thai, Chinese, Japanese.. the service was incredible... and appreciated their care for our kids. Ohana means family indeed! :) I love this place! The menu offers so much, I always have a hard timde deciding and inevitably order too much! Other reviews mention that some things are too expensive, and yes, that is true. However, the food is good &amp; they have some very interesting desserts. Our waiter was super rude. &#160;Service was slow. &#160;Food was ok. &#160;I'm a little embarrassed about suggesting my friends to go here for HH. &#160;We didn't leave all that happy. Solid Polynesian sushi. &#160;Great happy hour drinks and rolls, the spicy fried rice is awesome. &#160;Wait staff is usually sub-par. Yeah, I'm still a fan. &#160;I came back here tonight to try it during dinner hour. &#160;I tried the Kahlua pork, spam musubi and the Pele's coconut ice cream for dessert. &#160;The pork was really succulent, the spam musubi (with tamago) was perfectly made, and the coconut dessert (wrapped in pound cake and deep fried in tempura batter) was delicious. &#160;Of course I'll be back to try other dishes! I love me some tack, and if there was ever a shortage of Hawaiian needs in a seaport around the Sound, well Ohana is a tour de force. What it all comes down to is this: Spam. Let's be honest, we're all friends here. When you sit yourself down in a Tiki lovenest and find Spam on the menu, you've pretty much struck gold. On a whim, we dropped in for lunch on a shopping expedition, and because the rain was forcing us off of &#160;the streets. It was quiet, but that did not stop us from sitting in a booth and taking in the wall to wall coverage of bamboo and posters. For the food:I did not venture off for a bento box, but kind of wish I had because they looked delicious. But HUGE.OHANA HOUSE SALADSeasonal greens, romaine, tossed in a miso vinaigrette, topped with roasted red peppers, rice crackers &amp; daikon sprouts.*Yes please. I could have called it a day with just this alone. Flavors a go go so savor every bite.KATSUTender fillets of chicken lightly battered &amp; coated in panko. Fried crisp &amp; served with a piquant sauce with rice &amp; mac salad.*Having gone vegetarian I got sidetracked with the rice and mac salad so I ate that instead of the chicken. Mac Salad=Heaven with very little salt. Perfect!No drinks to report on, and I feel like I should have ordered some big fish bowl or something because it is a &#160;full service tiki bar. Next visit! Definitely satisfied with the amount of food and prices were completely reasonable. Visiting from Hawaii, it seems mandatory that you have to visit Ohana. As one would imagine, being a Hawaii themed bar, the interior mimics a grass shack. Kind of tacky? But who cares. This place is extremely chill and doesn't get overly crowded. Unfortunately, I can't remember how much drinks where, but the shots were big! =P On Friday night they played a lot of 90s and early 2000s hip hop, def a +1 in my book. Ohana is cool because... it's groovy like Austin Powers, and I mean grooOOOoovy, baby. &#160;They are friendly the atmosphere is relaxed and fun, and you can order lots of sushi rolls, robata &amp; cocktails off the happy hour menu and not feel poor. &#160;Happy hour is long. &#160;The decor is colorful but the lighting moody and late summer night like. &#160;But for that matter what is with the dark lighting in places all around Bell town?They have a quiz on Tuesdays, I came last, but &#160;then I was on my own, and at 7 points it was the highest score I've ever gotten on a pub quiz. &#160;probably because of the high number of TRUE / FALSE questions. &#160;Not making your customers feel stupid is another ohana like touch.All round good place, might give higher rating if I have more fun when I take friends back there. Ohana means family....or at least its a place where everyone treat you like fam...My first visit there was on wednesday the 7 of July after a brief stop at temple billard...uh 3 dollar happy hour??? &#160;yesssssirrr ohana me every wednesday...Ohana on wednsday...not crowded..and not dead...just people looking to drink and mingle...and see where it went from there...I order the ohana version of the long island..and my friend had a mai tai...we shared gyoza and spam musubi...yessssir...so good i had to come back again...Again...on saturday july 10 i found myself back at ohana before going to venom. &#160;marcos the bartender is very attentive...we got our order in, got our food and drinks, and were out the door in plenty of time...I can see ohana being a frequent spot to visit...why??Not busy, strong drinks, great service, great crowd, free, spam musubi, and it seem like thats where all the single ladies hang out before they get sh*t face lol...Ohana...i see you... First off, I must say that the staff at Ohana rocks. &#160;One of my many trips to Ohana was for early mother's day/Step-dads b-day. &#160;My step-dad was in the late stages of brain cancer and it was a rough night for all of us but with the great service we received we found it being more up-beat then the low that we had all been hovering at for the last few months. &#160;My &#160;mom is still in shock that you gave her a free lei! &#160;The picture that our waitress took of us together is the last "good" picture we have together and I'm very thankful for it. &#160;So, other then that experience my typical lunch experiences also rock! &#160;I LOVE the pork sandwich and the mac salad is my all time favorite (sorry mom!). &#160;I don't know if its typical, but I also find that its really cool that you top off my blended drinks when you have left overs throughout my meal (I must note though, they were really slow both times the bartender did it). &#160;Ohana has also catered a couple of our company events. &#160;I heard no complaints and the line for seconds was as long as the line for firsts!I don't know what Ohana is like when its packed but its my favorite eats on 1st ave when its a chill afternoon in Seattle. &#160;You keep on making that rockin pork and mac salad and I'll keep on coming back! I've been here several times, almost always for happy hour. This isn't the place you come for the best sushi in Seattle. It's for when you wish you were somewhere warmer and the best way to achieve that feeling (without skipping town) is to squeeze into a booth at Ohana with a fun group of friends, order some of those blue drinks, and let the tiki bar atmosphere transport you somewhere else.For $3 a pop, you can't beat the happy hour prices for a good selection of apps and a few sushi options. I kind of love the agedashi tofu - it's simple to the point of plain, but warm and comforting. I can see why others might think it's boring, but I think it makes a great winter snack. The sushi isn't special, but it's decent. You can't go wrong with the gyoza.Last time I went was with a big group of friends and the service was great. They didn't mind everyone ordering at different times, checked up on us regularly without being intrusive, and brough separate checks without us even asking. This place does have a warm friendly vibe and the HH is awesome, though I always only order the crunchy salmon and tuna roll. if i want to splurge, I would order the dragon boat adorned with delicious sashimi. this place is pretty chill but does get crowded depending on what nights you go, like wednesday which is island night where a live band plays island tunes. as far as drinks goes it's either beer or a blue hawaiian for me. drinks are strong depending on who makes it. the only gripe i have about this place is the "island style" restroom. no doors for the stalls. just curtains. 1st Wed of every month Ryland plays Jawaiian music. &#160;His great choice of music definitely makes for a great atmosphere that really fits the Hawaiian decor. &#160;The wait staff is fast and friendly. &#160;They have a great Happy Hour $3 items, good food and drink selection. &#160;I wouldn't consider it the best sushi house in town but combined with the people and atmosphere it's my goto place. Of all the sushi spots in Belltown, Ohana has to be my favorite. Unlike most places in Belltown *cough* Umi *cough*, there is no need to be 'seen'. You come to Ohana because its good food, great service, and really laid back.I generally come here for their happy hour (which is also probably one of my favorites in all of Seattle). If you decide to come here for HH as well, you HAVE to hit up on the Beef Rabata.Overall, I have nothing but glowing things to say about this place. Given the part of Seattle it's located in, it's nice to have a spot that is a different pace from the rest. FYI: Also come through on nights when DJ ASIA is spinning. She's always playing the cuts. Real Talk. Absolutely love this place. I use to frequent this place at least once a week to eat and at least once a week when I am bar hopping along belltown.The food and beverages here are delicious. The staff here are so wonderful and fun. My friends always order a half baked roll which is baked fish with spicy mayo on top of a California roll. Nothing compares to this roll. So mouth watering and savory. Every time I go to other sushi restaurants I try to find one just like it but it is never the same.Also spam musubi here is very yummy and their spicy fried rice. This place is a little Hawaii but I am sure those Hawaii folks would say otherwise but what ever I am from Seattle so this place is great for me.They accommodate large parties so if you want to throw a party here it is definitely worth it. I have had like 3 of my bday celebrations here. The DJ on the weekends are great and always plays the best cuts.If i could give this place 10 stars I would.. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. After See Sound Lounge, we stumbled into Ohana. Again, I'm not sure why but this place wasn't so bad. If I had known that they served spam musubi here, I would've been all over it! But I was apparently on the verge of blacking out... We sat at the bar, chopped it up with the bar back and bartender.. and had a drink each. I had a frozen alcoholic drink and some of my husband's drink.. which put me over the top.Somewhere in between Ohana and the cab ride home, I started to go into la la land.. and woke up in the same clothes from last night, face unwashed, teeth unbrushed.. and not feeling well. I went to the bathroom to brush up and ended up throwing up.. hmm not good at all. :( But .. bartender from Ohana, thanks for the drinks! The vibe of this restaurant is super cool and not at all what I expected to find in Seattle. &#160;The food is amazingly fresh and full of flavor. &#160;Unfortunately, the wait staff really sucks. &#160;Upon arriving at our table, a member of our party found that her chop sticks were stuck to her napkin... by a piece of used gum. &#160;When we alerted a member of the staff, he merely smirked as if he knew it was there and brought her another one. &#160;There was no acknowledgment that it was supremely disgusting to find something like that on the table. &#160;Additionally, we ordered edamame that didn't arrive until the end of our meal and not without reminding our waitress three times.Overall, the food was great but that's no substitution for good service. Okay... I love this place, I really do. &#160;I started out at 5 stars then deducted one because it gets so damn loud in here when the live music starts, you simply cannot enjoy your food... &#160;Then, there's the parking. Sure, it's not their fault but really, it sucks. &#160;It sucks a lot. &#160;It keeps me from coming here when I really want to! &#160;Like I said, I love this place. &#160;The tuna wrapped in seaweed flash fried in tempura batter - heaven. &#160;Pure bliss. &#160;And, any place that will hook you up with some Spam musubi... &#160;dis place is da ono grindz I'm not in a hurry to come back here any time soon!So, on our trek to look for sushi and decent happy hour, my coworkers and I stopped in here (both Umi's and List were crazy busy). &#160;I had heard some good things about this place, and the Yelp reviews seemed fine, so we decided to give it a try. &#160;I ordered the Iced Tea on the HH menu, along with the mini ohana salad and both a crunchy spicy tuna roll and the crunchy eel rolls (all on the HH menu). &#160;My coworkers each ordered a drink, the salad, and two rolls from themselves as well. &#160;I thought, "great, $3 HH specials!" &#160;NOT. &#160;First off, our waiter was super friendly, but the service lacked. &#160;My coworkers got their rolls first, then we got our salads, then our drinks. &#160;I'm sorry, does that seem a little backwards to anyone else? &#160;Not to mention, my waiter COMPLETELY forgot my order in the process. &#160;He forgot my order the first time when he failed to bring me my sushi order, and then forgot a second time, when he brought only HALF of my order, and I had to correct him again. &#160; &#160;Then, there's the food. &#160;$3 sounds great, but it's ONE freaking hand roll. &#160;If I had to order enough food to get me full, I would have probably spent more than I would have buying full price items. &#160;And my coworkers though the tuna roll smelled/tasted a little fishy; maybe that's why they covered it up with tempura batter sprinkles. &#160;The ohana salad was fine (with miso dressing), but nothing that I couldn't have gotten at your run-of-the-mill teriyaki joint. &#160; &#160;It sounds like a lot of people come here to drink before going out, or to soak up all the alcohol after going to the bars. &#160;But the food definitely didn't taste great while sober. Overall, not a good experience. &#160;This place is definitely not a sushi place...but maybe I'll be back for their more Hawaiian inspired food. My girlfriend and I randomly stopped by here for some sake and sushi. &#160;After waiting unsuccessfully for a server for around 5 minutes to get our drink order we relocated to the sushi bar where we had to finally flag down the hostess to flag the server to get our drinks in.We ordered a few rolls at the bar which were underwhelming. This place may be great for happy hour, but paying full price for 6 piece rolls that are Safeway quality wasn't too impressive.Unless you're here for happy hour I'd pass on this place. The food is good, they have some great hawaiian foods here and some very good drinks. &#160;My favourite drink is the BIG ISLAND ICE TEA, it has a dash of mango puree. &#160;It's simply amazing! &#160;If you're a fan of mangoes then this is the drink for you. The sushi is isn't that great. &#160;Like there's much better in belltown but it's all right. &#160;I'd stick to the regular menu though. This place can get expensive once you rack up the drinks but the atmosphere is nice and the decor is very friendly. &#160;People are nice and people are just coming in to have fun. &#160;Would highly recommend bringing friends to a place like this. SUPER CHILL! I like Hawaiian food and this place certainly can get you your fix. &#160;I liked the happy hour menu - spam musubi for $3 and lots of sushi rolls and other dishes for around the same price.I also ordered some poke which was pretty good - I was glad that they were able to do it since I didn't see it on the menu. &#160;Drinks were good too - of course, I'm always tickled to see Firefly iced tea on a West Coast menu - I thought it was an East Coast preppy thing. &#160;Glad to see it's not.Gotta get back over here next time I'm in Seattle - good food, good service, and laid back atmosphere. This place is awesome.Ramen bowls, sushi and sake! oh my!"Firecracker" roll is the best! Way better than their extra crunchy roll. Love their fried rice &amp; ahi poke!!! &#160;Spam &#160;musubi &amp; some other items are a bit over priced. I absolutely loved my experience during Happy Hour here with a friend of mine! &#160;We both got sushi... which was nice and cheap... and they were all very tasty. &#160;I also loved sitting outside during a nice, warm Seattle evening. &#160;My b/f and I also had dinner here once and their food was mighty tasty!! YUM! &#160;I definitely recommend it! &#160;Their drinks are a hit as well :) $3 full sail ambers at happy hr. &#160;very nice. &#160;our group was big enough to take over the entire outside deck. &#160;i have liked ohana now for a few years. &#160;it's got a nice relaxed vibe in the heart of belltown.
Pu-pu-pu-pusa! &#160;**sing to the Chia Pet jingle** &#160;Ever since I had some really awesome pupusas at Platano (Berkeley, CA) a couple of months ago, I've had this obsession with pupusas. &#160;I lamented about where I can find a place in town that can even compare to Platano when my friend suggested I try Guanaco. &#160;That was great advice! &#160;I think I have visited these guys at least four times in the last few weeks to satisfy my pupusa cravings. So far I have only had two kinds of pupusas:Pork and cheese (chicharron &amp; queso)Squash, cheese, jalapenos and spinach (ayote, queso, jalapeno, espinaca)These tasty treats only run $2.10 each! &#160;Just two pupusas fill me up which is quite surprising.  &#160;  &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ___________________________________ &#160; &#160;(___________________________________) &#160; &#160;- &#160;PUPUSA &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;+ &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; _____________ &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I &#160; &#160; &#160; - &#160; CONTAINER OF CURTIDO &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;(PICKLED CABBAGE) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; \___________ &#160;/ &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; + &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;__ &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ___I &#160; I___ &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; I &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; I &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; I &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; I &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; I &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; I &#160; &#160; &#160;- &#160;SQUEEZE BOTTLE OF SALSA / VERDE &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; I &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; I &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; I_______ I &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;= &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;HAPPY RONPu-pu-pu-pusa! &#160;**sing to the Chia Pet jingle** Ok ok ok.. I am not a big fan of this place, and there are reasons why...Their pupusa had too much cheese in it, and I felt like they should have calmed down on the cheese ... it was a little overwhelming, and the slaw they bring you is a little bit on the watery side... Their taco's would be better if they used better chicken, and their fish didn't have bones in it.. but the corn torilla was delicious....Their rice was AMAZING!!! so amazing I took the insides of my taco and stuffed my taco with the rice... The price was exceptional though, so for the poor college student that wants to be filled for under 10 dollars, and wants somewhat of home cooking can come here.. I will not give up on &#160;guanaco's, .... I will dine once again and try something different...... I will not give up on you...... tbc..... Sometimes I like to start my review with a good story, a description of the food or at least something funny. But I'm going with the K.I.S.S rule on this one*. This place is good; really good. It's small and plain but once you get in the door the smells hit you in the face(sometimes the smoke from the kitchen literally hits you). And you'll be greeted by whoever's behind the counter.The Pupusas are great. Packed with ingredients but not busting at the seems. I love fried Yuca, and make it all the time, but there's is really good. Just golden on the outside and soft and flaky on the inside. Fried plantains are sweet and carmelized but not burnt. I think though, that the tacos are the top of my list. I always get at least one. A lot of tacos around here come with dried out meat and look like they were dropped on the tortilla with a tiny melon baller. These are juicy and fat with lots of sabor.Great food, nice people, good location. Like the announcers on the soccer games that always seem to be on I'll say Goaaaaaallllllllllllllllllllllllllll!*Keep It Simple Stupi So, I've come to the conclusion that pupusas are out to take Seattle by storm.One rainy day, I had just gotten off of the bus and wanted some take-out. Walking down Brookylyn Ave, I was ready to accept anything to get out of the torrential Seattle downpour. And lo and behold, I laid my eyes upon this little hole in the wall. Now I can thank the heavens that the sun wasn't shining, or else I never would have found one of my favorite U-District restaurants!I had never tried El Salvadorean food before, so I asked the friendly owner what I shoud try. He recommended a pupusa, so I gave it a whirl. I chose a pork and cheese pupusa. I heard the "slap-slap" noise of the cooks preparing my food in the back, and in a few minutes I had my first of many, many pupusas. The pupusa was delicious - not quite taco, not quite quesadilla, but 100% delicious, cheesy, and homemade. Since this first encounter with Guanaco's I have become a regular customer. &#160;I am an adventurous eater and ususally never order the same thing twice, but I can't seem to stop ordering my staple cheese and pork pupusas every time I go! Cheap and delicious, with friendly staff to boot. I also recommend the horchata. I also keep them in business by bringing in my friends and family.So I guess the Seattle rain really is good for something, it introduced me to this wonderful little joint, and maybe one day I'll even go to El Salvador to try the "real thing." I'm not sure if I still have not recovered from my food aversion (I got food poisoning from a pupusa at a different El Salvadoran restaurant), but for some reason I can't seem to enjoy them the way I used to. &#160;The pupusas here were fresh (definitely a plus) and they were quick in making them, but the flavor to me was just not quite right. &#160;Good, but not great. &#160;This could also be the consequence to my lack of ability to eat cheese now...I personally love restaurants where you grab your own utensils, water, napkins, etc. &#160;It cuts down the costs (this place is inexpensive!) and is it really that difficult to take a few extra steps to grab them?The service was really great too. &#160;The guys checked in on how our food was and were nice when we were ordering. &#160;They had no problem accommodating my dietary restriction. This place is pretty good, however there aren't very many vegan or dairy free options but they will make them for you if you ask.I had a pupusa with beans only, plantains and a corn bread tasting thing so my plate was filled with all yellow foods. I think if there were more veggie/vegan options, I'd def frequent this place a lot more because for $8.00, I can get a lot more variety in my diet elsewhere. Otherwise, the food everyone else got did look super delicious and it was really crowded at lunch time.I think I'll be back though, because they had a special menu on the side where I noticed as I was leaving where they had veggie pupusas. A big + is that they were really nice about making sure that I had no cheese in the pupusas I ordered today which meant I did not curl up at Odegaard with stomach cramps and general unpleasant gut-pain. :Dp.s. HUSKIES - they take the Husky card here! Greasy and bland. &#160;The pastelitos were well-spiced and tasty, but just about everything else was almost flavorless. &#160;The pupusas (pockets of greasy fried pork and cheese and beans) needed some sort of seasoning (beyond the squeeze bottle of salsa on the table), and the fried yucca needed some sort of seasoning (beyond the squeeze bottle of salsa on the table) and the authentic Salvadorean drinks tasted a lot like unfrozen Otter Pops (which I suppose might be a Salvadorean delicacy).I could see myself enjoying this food as part of a long night of drinking on the Ave, but those days are way in my past, as I guess is my taste for pupusas. I've had this place bookmarked for ages and finally checked it out yesterday. &#160;I was not let down!This winter while visiting a friend in LA who is Salvadorian, I was introduced to the famous pupusa and fell in love. &#160;So I just had to compare since Seattle isn't real known for having top notch Latin cuisine.And...I think maybe Guanaco was even better than the one my Salvadorian friend took me to in LA!!I didn't think they were very greasy at all and the ingredients tasted great! &#160;I ordered one meat and one veggie (I think the veggie had zuchinni and chilies) and an horchata to wash it all down. &#160;The horchata was actually very different than most other horchata I've ever had, but it was tasty in its own right. &#160;It almost tasted like a chai or coffee drink and it was very frothy. &#160;It took a bit of time to make too--wasn't just out of one of those giant tanks.The whole meal was also super cheap. &#160;I know I'll be back again!! I'm sorry, what? &#160;I am seated, but then I have to go up to the counter to order? Huh?Papusas are tasty? &#160;Okay, maybe it's just me but I was thoroughly disappointed with the so-called "Papusa" that everyone has been yelping about. &#160;I admit I've never tried one before, so it's hard to really rate the Papusa objectively. (By the way, it reminds me of a filled pancake). Anyway, I had two pupusas (Pork &amp; Cheese) and a steak taco. &#160;The papusa didn't really have any flavor. &#160;It was really cheese and I forgot that there was pork inside. &#160;The taco wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. &#160;Though, it isn't very hard to screw up meat in a tortilla. &#160;It was overly greasy and the tortillas came out ridiculously soggy. &#160;Their hot sauce was a complete joke, it tasted like water. Fortunately, the employee was really friendly (owner?). &#160;The interior is also decorated nicely, but it doesn't really make up for the food. Be aware that you're going to be seated with menus when you get inside, but have to go to the counter to order. &#160;Weird. I have never been to El Salvador but I love the food at Guanaco's Tacos.I work near University Avenue and am frequently disappointed by the lack of diversity of the restaurants that surround UW. Before Guanaco's, I have never tried El Salvadoran food and after multiple visits, I am happy that Guanaco's provides a taste of El Salvador as an alternative to the Teriyaki, Thai, Pho, and Falafel in the U District.Guanaco's primarily serves non-Tex Mex, El Salvadoran food that includes Pupusa (a thick corn pancake filled with cheese and your choice of protein), Pastelitos (a deep-fried turnover with similar contents as the Pupusa), Empanadas that are filled with plaintains and what I think is creamed corn, and Tamales. For less than $7, combination plates come with your choice of three items and Curtido which is a refreshing Salvadoran cole slaw that complements the greasier items. Alternatively, these items and traditional tacos are served a la carte. Daily specials are also written on a dry erase board near the cash register.For drinks, they serve chocolate Horchata, a wonderful Agua Fresca that is like a fruit salad in beverage form, and cervezas. As other reviewers mentioned, the ordering protocol requires you to pay upfront at the cash register after ordering. Utensils and water are self service next to the cash register. In this case, partial waiter service means that the owner will bring out the food to your table, and they will bus your plates.The owner is super friendly and enjoys explaining the dishes for virgin experiences. I am a big fan of diversity and family-owned restaurants, and Guanaco's is now a part of my lunch repertoire. I just got back from Guanacos and I have to say that I love this place. &#160;This was my second time dining here and it was as great as the first time. Today I tried the Grilled Chicken a la Guanaco and it was cooked to perfection. &#160;The chicken was well seasoned with what seemed to be lime and herbs. &#160;And, it was served with rice, beans, homemade tortillas, and a salad. &#160;All this for $10.25! &#160;And the portions were huge. &#160;I also tried the Ensalada Fresca drink which is made with finely chopped apples, mango, carrots and served in pineapple juice. &#160;It sounds strange but it was delicious. &#160;I guess you could call it a fruit salad drink. &#160;And, of course I had to have a pupusa which is their specialty. &#160;They are so yummy. &#160;My personal favorite so far is the pupusa with chicharron (pork) filling. &#160;Other filling options are cheese, refried beans, spinach and other veggie options. &#160;You can also combine any of the fillings and customize your own pupusa.The staff here is also really nice and will answer any questions you have about their menu. &#160;I can't wait to try their other dishes. Reasonably tasty and definitely affordable. I can't knock any place too hard when you can get a decent meal for under $6. I tried 3 different vegetarian dishes (also uploaded photos on yelp, if you're curious). I prefer spicier food so I found this to be more basic comfort food than something wildly exciting, but I also don't eat meat so that limited my menu options somewhat. First time having Salvadorian so take it for what its worth. &#160;I like this place- Eurocup playing in the background, sassy service, and decent ethnic food for the budget. &#160;Although I stopped here for dinner I think this would be a great lunch place. &#160;A change from burgers and falafels on the ave. I finally got to go there and I love it. &#160;The place is clean and very cute. &#160;The staff was very friendly and we got our orders fresh hot and fast. &#160;I have falled in love with the pupusas (I had the pork and cheese) and a pork burrito which was huge and stuffed with yummy pork. I also like the fact that they serve beer. &#160;You bet will be back again and again. Don't get me wrong - The Ave is an amazing place for ethnic cuisine, and I hit a Pho bowl in cloudy cold weather like it was instinct, but being originally from Colorado I do crave Mexican food from time to time. &#160;No, not Chipotle. &#160;Chipotle is its own little edible miracle, but it is not Mexican food. &#160;And technically neither is Guanaco's Tacos, which instead gives the untried but delicious looking El Salvadorian side of South American cuisine. &#160;After being told they were fresh out of empanadas (I'm thinking that's a testament to their popularity, not a problem in the inventory) I went with the combo of one pupusa, fried yuca and a pastelito with the side of cabbage salad.The pupusa is the real draw here - corn tortilla sandwiching your choice of fillings. &#160;I'm pretty sure mine was bean, cheese and steak. &#160;Absolutely superb. &#160;I mean, flavor bursts from this thing, and the mouthfeel is superb. &#160;This is better than some of my favorite Mexican restaurants and their tortilla dishes back home. &#160;The fried yuca is also new, and delicious though goes well with a light sauce, of which they offer two types at Guanaco's. &#160;Finally, the orange-ish gem of pastelito was a real high note to end on. &#160;It's yielding to a fork, but when you do the insides escape out, giving off the aromatic seasoned beef smells inside. &#160;The only part of the combo I didn't care for was the cabbage salad which had a pickled taste to it. &#160;It's a little odd considering I usually love pickled anything. &#160;Still, the cabbage is, if nothing else, bedding to an incredible meal that really stands out in a blur of Pho and Thai food. &#160;This joins a select few "Ave Eateries" as one of my favorite places to eat as a student (fat budget or slim budget). I love this place! The food is some of the best in town. It has made me a nut for pupuse. The other really fantastic thing they have here are the tamales. Light creamy meaty and tasty. There is just too much good food here.
It's Teriyaki, you get it quickly, there are seats, I did not get food poisoning. Note: If you go in the back entrance (no, that's not a euphemism) you want down a scary hallway where I fear the asian teriyaki mafia may shank me and steal my money, but no, instead you end up in a teriyaki place.I give it bonus points for the lack of sketchiness and general speed-itude, but with so many awesome places to eat in Pioneer Square this is just a a-ok from me. Reasons I will never eat here again:1) Teriyaki is gross (both regular and spicy).2) Teriyaki is gross.3) Teriyaki is gross.
(As a preface, we were completely starving when we arrived....so you know how under desperate circumstances one will be more likely to leave satisfied than at any other time.)The ladies at the counter were not especially pleasant. I could understand if it was the sassy fisherman attitude, but it really just seemed like they were annoyed with us. Whatever...we were hungry.The fish 'n chips were not as greasy and flavorful as I had hoped. Too much breading. Not enough gooey batter. Fries were fine. $8 for four pieces of cod, fries, and a medium coke.The view wasn't worth mentioning, either (unless you get one of two tables by the edge.)Good enough, filling, not exorbitantly priced, but I'll look elsewhere for fish 'n chips next time. Non-greasy deep fried cod with the best tasting tartar sauce around? &#160;Magical!no frills carryout with a eating area attached. &#160;guard ya vittles from the ferocious sea gulls there tho'I thought the pieces of fish were kinda small tho' especially after paying 10 bux for 5 pieces, the other fried items were just as tasty tho' &#160;well i jusy blew my carb count today! For clarity: There are two Ivar's at this location!!! 1st is the FISH BAR...that is the outer service counter on the street with the outside seating. &#160;That is what should be getting reviewed here. &#160;I've scrolled down to see some reviews for the actual Ivar's Restaurant which is right next door. &#160;Just an FYI.Fish Bar: I think that Ivar's is awesome and full of good grub! &#160;The chowder is yummy but I've yet to try the salmon chowder. &#160;The cream based thick chowder is so good that I actually just come for that alone.It's on the pricey side but what seafood isn't? &#160;Honestly, seafood is always more expensive than your other proteins! &#160;I love feeding the sea gulls and watching the tour boats take off. &#160;This is a great place to chill out on a summer day/night, people watch and enjoy some traditional seafood. Love this place. &#160;My BFF took me here and I love it! To me, the Ivar's Pier 54 Fish Bar is about as classic Seattle as it gets. &#160;With the memories tied to this place over the years, a visit to Seattle waterfront is not complete for me without a visit here. &#160;Although the food is good, I would venture to say there is likely better in Seattle. &#160;I have eaten here many times, but I have only gone as far into the menu as the fish &amp; chips. &#160;That being said, the original cod fish &amp; chips are consistently good. &#160;The cod is breaded and fried, and the end result is flaky, moist and not overly greasy. &#160;The french fries are natural cut and are generally nice and crispy. &#160;I would have to say that in the world of fast-food, natural-cut, french fries, they are one of the better examples. &#160;Also, I have not tried the clam chowder, but I have been told the chowder is good (a cream-based chowder that looks very thick).Whether feeding the greedy seagulls from the pier in the summer or taking refuge from the cold under the giant toaster-oven heating elements in the winter, half of the experience is in the atmosphere. &#160;A view of Puget Sound and watching the ferries passing in and out of the nearby ferry terminal makes this a good spot to bring yourself or your tourist friends for a lunch stop along the waterfront. *Update* Ah crap, I was trying to review Acres of Clams not the Fish Bar. Oh well, pretty much the same damn thing.More like 3 1/2 but I will round up. We came here for a Yelp event after work and they treated us well. Alyson called before hand and they assured her that they can accomodate 15 people at 5. Ron and I got there and soon met up with Alyson but didn't see anyone else. A waiter told us that they actually saved an area for the 15 of us in the front. Not only did we have our own spot, but fellow yelpers could see us when they came in. Rock!I had three tasty Jack n Cokes (tasty meaning more Jack than Coke) and since I am not eating meat right now, had to settle on edamame and fries. I have to say that these were some of the best fries I have had in awhile. Everyone else seemed to love the taste of their dead animals. I don't eat fish at all, so this is not a place I would go to by myself. But tonight's visit was very enjoyable I wouldn't mind coming here again kick ass fries and strong drink.*Update* I almost forgot the fact that they put all our orders on one tab. That is a pain in the ass and it is better for all of us to have separate tabs.Zipzap Zubidy Bop! I loved this place! The food was excellent! My sister and I ate out on the Pier and (just like everyone else) fed the seagulls french fries. :-) I tourist trap for sure but it is fun to stand in line for greesy over priced fish that you will end up feeding the to Gulls for kicks anyway.Throw the fish in the air...Two gulls enter one gull leave! I loved eating on the waterfront with the seagulls, but the chowder wasn't anything to write home about. It was really white with a thin consistency; a bit more clam juice and light cream would've done the trick. Oh, and oyster crackers.I'm picky with my clam chowder because I went to school in Boston, MA where I was spoiled with the best of it. Ivar's has nothing on Legal Sea Foods' clam chowder, which is so good it's served at Presidential Inaugurations. good place to take out of towners-or kids- or me!!I love feeding those damn seagulls my fries! &#160;If my date took me here- I would know that we were destined to be together! &#160;It's my favorite place that I don't tell people about. &#160;Only downfall- price- otherwise outside is kept up nicely.If it's too cold- go inside- the bar is nice.It's great late night too- just be careful- that neighborhood can be iffy. RESERVATION/ WAIT: &#160; &#160; No reservation. No wait. Only long lines. Wow! That could be an advertisement line. &#160;APPETIZER: &#160; &#160; Tanker of ChowderOur review: &#160; &#160; Yummy, yummy in my tummy. It was so yummy. We got another tanker to take home.MEAL:Both: &#160; &#160; &#160;2 orders of Halibut n' ChipsBoth reviews: &#160; &#160; Yummy, yummy in my tummy. &#160;DESSERT: &#160; &#160; They don't serve dessert in this fish bar.AMBIENCE: &#160; &#160; We ate at the back side and my goodness, there were so many seagulls waiting for some scraps. It was getting darker when we got there so we tried to finish up quickly. They need more lights out there. But still, we enjoyed our first Ivar meal. As long as we're eating, light or no light, we're good. (We're easy to please. Can't you tell?)PRICE: &#160; &#160; It was about $45. The price for the Halibut n' Chips before was $10.99. I think now it's $11.99. SERVICE: &#160; &#160; It's self-served.OVERALL: &#160; &#160; We love seafood and we love Chowdah. We like Ivar so much that we tried the Ivar at Bellis Fair in Bellingham. &#160;1 star &#160; - Never again.2 stars - Only when I'm really hungry. 3 stars - It was good but I'll order something else next time.4 stars - Oooh. I want some more but I'm full!5 stars - Yummy, yummy in my tummy. My hubby wouldn't eat at Ivar's when we were up in Marysville, so today's lunch was my guilty pleasure. &#160;I was going to go to Nijo but ended up at Ivar's so I could a) enjoy the sunshine; b)eat my fried seafood in peace and not have to share (buzz off you water rats!); &#160;c) gaze at the Sound. &#160;Dare I say that I came to the conclusion most fried seafood is indistinguishable from other seafood items, at least at Ivar's? &#160;I got the razor clams &amp; fries (though I really wanted to get the fried WA oysters). &#160;I got 3 heavily breaded clams &amp; couldn't really enjoy the razor clams themselves. &#160;Yeah, the breading was nice and crispy (not soggy, like the end of my meal at the Athenian), but I really wanted the meatiness of the razor clam to shine through. &#160;Maybe I'm spoiled by Ipswich fried clams, but that's another story. . . Aside from the screeching seagulls, I did have a peaceful lunch at the tables alongside Ivar's. All I know is, if I were a seagull, I would fucking LIVE and MOOCH off the people that don't get tired of feeding seagulls at this Ivar's fish bar.Unfortunatley, I am one of those people that never gets tired of chucking buckets of fries at the Seagulls only to see the seagull catch it, or drop the fry and have 289038 other seagulls flock to the water immediately, desperately trying to retrieve the dropped fry. It's pretty amusing, I SWEAR. And I get a serious kick out of it.Head straight for the tables along the pier, becasue I'm telling you, there is nothing better than a 70-degree sunny Seattle day than feeding the seagulls and watching the ferries go by while shoveling your face with delicious food. It just doesn't get any better.I love the fish and chips, chowder, kolslaw, pretty much everything on their menu. It's Seattle, and it's Ivars, so it has to be amazing right? RIGHT.Bottom line? Ivar's = Love. So take it for what it is!And don't forget to spend like two dollars on extra fries to feed the Seagulls! It's just good karma. I might be the only person on the planet who loves Ivar's and doesn't eat seafood. I am probably the only person from Seattle who doesn't drink coffee or eat seafood, but that's a whole other story.I love the chicken and chips, with the chips extra crispy. The thought of this place makes me homesick!! No one does chicken strips like Ivar's does. I am so ashamed of myself for not grabbing any seafood while in Seattle recently. After savoring Ivar's fresh cod and scallops at SeaTac Airport, I truly deserved to have someone smack me over the head with a stinky live fish.Delicate, fresh, nicely battered. What more could a seafood lover ask for? Oh, yeah, settling in Seattle. Ivar Haglund was a legend in Seattle. &#160;That's great. &#160;Ivar's makes damn good fish &amp; chips. &#160;Their clam chowder rules all the clam chowders. &#160;Clam Nectar is one of the most disgusting items ever concieved in the minds of depraved fishermen. &#160;IF YOU LIKE CLAM NECTAR, YOU ARE PROBABLY F*D UP IN THE HEAD. &#160;Seagulls are aggressive down here. &#160;They want your food. &#160;It's like "The Birds." I would probably be giving this place 4 stars but there are a few bad reviews down there for Acres of Clams (the restaurant) and that's not fair to this little fish bar. First of all, this place is so much a part of Seattle to me. Ivar's and Ivar himself. We would often come here while I was growing up, get fish and sit in the dirty seating area to eat before going out to feed the seagulls. If relatives came to visit, we'd bring em here. &#160;Second, the fish is good! The fries are good and I like how they get a little soggy cause of sitting under the fish. The chowder is great except for the clams, which I don't like. They're too chewy. I really like the flavor and the potatoes though. Ordering is an experience too. If it's crowded, you yell your fried order out and when it's your turn at the front, order your chowder drinks, shrimp cocktail, whatever. They have great tarter and will give you as much as you want in those cute little Ivar's cups. I guess it's kinda a waste of packaging but great for to-go orders (which they pack well). I usually just get the regular fish n chips which comes with cod but if you wanna splurge, you can get Halibut which is a little firmer and a little less greasy. Those are the differences in my mind... I don't really know.Also, it's pronounced AYE-vers, not like the street in Hollywood that's pronounced aye-VARS.And they grace us with dancing clams for parades and festivals! People in clam outfits! Dancing!! Yay Ivar's!!! Its east coast but out west. &#160;One of my favorite parts about hitting Boston and the rest of New England is the seafood. &#160;The one thing that Ivars is missing is crab cakes, but they more than make up for it with their chowder, fish and chips, and clams. &#160;Although the chowder can't compare to the thicker richer East Coast version, its not bad for a west coast re-make.My favorite part about this restaurant is also my least favorite part. &#160;I cant stand all the homeless and the seagulls around here. &#160;But its still nice to be able to eat seafood outside in the sun (if it ever emerges out in seattle). &#160;Be preparred to be harassed by bums for change and seagulls for fries and clam strips, but if you are like me you wont share! Man, I read so much good stuff on here... was disappointed.Granted the Halibut in the Halibut and chips was good, thin batter, lots of fish and nice Halibut... but BUT BUT... it's a tiny 3 pieces and it's $11.99!!!! &#160;Can you say ouch?After walking back to my office, I was still hungry... good food, but way too pricey for what you get. &#160;I think you get better fares eating fish and chips at pike place. The educated Seattle tourist might be familiar with the maxim that it's best to stay away from the waterfront. &#160;There's some truth to it - the seafood restaurants along it tend to be overpriced and of middling quality. &#160;One strong exception is Ivar's, a beheamouth of a place which looks like it would have horrible food but doesn't. &#160;The fish taco is strong, as are the plain old fish 'n' chips. &#160;The worst part: &#160;fitting the tartar sauce into those tiny little cups, and carrying them to your own table! Ehhhh.I was a bit disappointed with this places. The portions are tiny tiny tiny.Can I have at least a few more fries please?I could easily mistake their fish and chips with frozen fish. The fries were good here though. I liked the garlic vinegar and the variety of sauces available. Next time I'm in Seattle I'd skip this place. This place is so Seattle, I want to fall in love here someday or run into some famous author turned bum. Fish au cardboard, so what? its Ferpect
This diner doesn't deserve 4 stars, it's a pretty normal diner.It has breakfast foods and lunchy things like sandwiches. It's pretty good, but I like most diner food. I'd call it a step up from Denny's strictly due to ambiance and the Varsity Inn's lack of chicken fried steak... they do have good menu options with something for everyone. And the service is nice.It's an "A-OK" diner, but not worth going out of your way for. If you're looking for anything fancy or out of the ordinary, you may be disappointed. But if you're looking for an unpretentious place to get a typical diner-type breakfast served by genuinely nice people, Varsity Inn is the place to go. I had one of the absolute best breakfast burritos here at Varsity Inn. &#160;I had the egg, cheese and chorizo burrito. &#160;And hash browns. &#160;HUGE serving size and delicious! &#160;I would definitely go back next time I'm in the area. Really good breakfast. Chilaquiles were awesome. Bleck. As greasy spoon as it gets! Not my cup. Some might love it for the prices and nice service which are both pretty damn good. Standard breakfast food is OK, but the Mexican specials are the what elevate this place from 2 to 3 stars. I would give this place 4 stars if they concentrated on Mexican breakfast items. The first time I went, the special was chilaquiles. Fantastic. And homemade salsa to boot!
the decor isn't much, but we really enjoyed ourselves. sitting at the counter allows for lots of friendly conversation with the friendly waitstaff. much like a denny's with an upgrade, the portions were large and the food was very ma-and-pop. excellent french toast. Apparently, Beth's is a cool place to be at noon on Saturday or something, at least judging by the block-wrapping line we encountered this morning. Go figure. Beth's is good, but not an hour's wait good, we decided, and that's when we stumbled into Pete's.I was mainly looking for eggs (again, go figure), so I went with the Callifornia scramble while the BF decided on french toast. The prices seemed okay enough (~$9 each), so I was surprised at the size of our dishes when they arrived. The scramble was the size of my head, and the size of the hash browns was second only to the Mecca's baby-sized hash. &#160;My only issue with this is that you don't really take breakfast food home with you, so unless you are a rower in training or a growing boy, you'll probably end up leaving at least half your dish there. I'm just not down with throwing food away.In the end, we decided that Pete's is probably the kind of place that you would see on the Travel channel, where it's called a "hidden gem" (or insert your own favourite cliche that gets spewed by a person who gets paid to eat). Me, I don't know if I'd go out of my way or stand in line to eat here, but if I happen to be in Greenwood and crave a good pile of scrambled eggs, I'll stop by. I should probably give this place 3 stars, but I really &#160;like Greek people. I have been to Pete's twice now and love it for what it is. As everyone else has already explained, Pete's is a greasy family-owned breakfast joint that serves huge portions. We went on a Sunday for brunch and, although it seemed busy, we were seated immediately. Erin ordered the California omelet (or scramble? don't remember) and Jon got the steak and eggs, because he had never tried that before. Both meals were delicious and definitely abundant. Possibly overabundant. I mean, Erin basically took another whole meal home with her, and while Jon could have done the same, he instead finished it then and there and didn't eat anything else until the middle of the day on Monday.I also brought a couple friends here who were visiting from out of town. My friends love to eat, and they love big portions, so this was the natural choice. They definitely liked it and were amazed at the multi-tiered serving of hashbrowns. Yes, my insatiable friends asked for boxes.I have found service to be quick and friendly here, and for one of those "greasy" places, I don't really find it to be lacking in the cleanliness department (luckily I did not find bugs in the salt like the guy below). I will definitely be back.
Yes, this bakery is really quite "essential"! A great addition to the Madison area, it's a place where people from far and wide come to get their lattes, crepes, coffees, etc. The employees are really friendly, although sometimes their friendliness with other customers gets in the way of their efficiency rate... Also, the ventilation in there isn't that good, so don't be surprised if you find yourself smelling like the bakery a few hours after you leave. Onto the food. It's great. Really, truly, pretty good. The hot chocolates hit the spot, and their pastries are two thumbs up. While it didn't hit it out of the park, I'll go here any day to grab a nice, heartwarming snack. Bread gets 4 - 5 stars. &#160;It is great!Pastries a solid 3 and some of their chocolate creations get a 4 - 5Atmosphere w/o staff - 4Coffee 3.5 - 4 starsSandwiches.. well.. read onStaff overall gets a 2. &#160;Meh! &#160;A few people who work here are great but they do all the work. &#160;There are several freeloaders who work here who stand around and give lots of passive aggressive attitude to customers and do sloppy sloppy work, if they do anything at all. &#160;I think the staff has gone downhill in the past 12 months. &#160;Last summer got pretty darn bad. &#160;After 4 or 5 very disappointing experiences I'm not sure i can go back for anything but the bread.. which I will just buy at the grocery store.The Sandwiches, which once were delicious and one of the best (the Turkey is my favorite) has become a sloppy disgusting mess, not worthy of a $5, much less the $10 you will spend on it with tax. &#160;I will post a picture of the disgusting mess which had no less than 6 -8 tablespoons of mayo on it. &#160;I kid you not. &#160;They were out of their usual lettuce and so it was just mayo, turkey and iceburg lettuce. &#160;The turkey &#160;taste a bit off 1/2 way through the sandwich and I couldn't finish it. &#160;That was probably a good thing that spared me chest pains later.. that was after I wasted the pulp of 8 napkins trying to wipe off heaps of mayo from the bread. &#160;Not only did I feel ripped off, stomach heavy, and like I needed a shower (swimming in mayo).. but I'd had to deal with some of the surliest customer service in Seattle.. and that is quite a title. &#160; When they handed me my sandwich, the outside wrapper was smeared with grease (foretelling of the mayonnaise shower I would later experience) I asked them about it. &#160;And got explained to with condescension, that it was mayo. &#160;Right, that I know.. but why is it everywhere on the outside of this wrapper? &#160;I politely, asked them to re-wrap it. &#160;The guy who stood around and pawned it off on his busy co-worker to re-wrap it was seething with rage and made lots of rude comments while we waited on her to do 4 jobs at once, because this guy can't be bothered to lift a finger. &#160;Anger management, he can't seem to perform in any customer service capacity. &#160; Re-wrapping the sandwich didn't help a whole lot because there were like I said 8 spoonfuls of mayo which streamed out once I opened the wrapper.. but I was trying to save being coated with mayonnaise. &#160;Good Luck! &#160;If you see a greasy sandwich wrapper coming your way here, I suggest you just get your money back. &#160;And save yourself the trouble. &#160;I hope management will address this problem and I can up their stars to the 4 they deserved in their heyday!
Yum! Delicious and friendly and cheap!! Like every Vietnamese deli in Seattle they serve the essentials of banh mi...che...goi cuon...etc. I love this place! The one thing that sets it aside is the the Vietnamese dessert section is much larger than most other places. I really like their banh bo. The pate they use in the sandwiches is phenomenal..... I hadn't been in a few years but remember how good it was so I went back..taking my sweetie along with me.I spent $4.00 at this Hole in the Wall place. &#160;That got me a Ice Cold French Coffee and a lovely chicken Banh Mi on a crispy french bun with crunchy pickled veggies. &#160;All I can say is YUM! &#160;This is a stop in and grab and go place. &#160;But you must be *BOLD* to make your order otherwise it can be a bit of a free for all. &#160;They will ask but if you aren't ready when they do then you will have to work to get attention. &#160;I will be back. &#160;Perfect food on a summer evening. &#160;Great to grab and go watch a sunset or have a picnic :) This restaurant is incredible!! The price is right... The staff is friendly and efficient... The tofu sandwich? Words fail me. Paired with one of those semi-sweet sesame balls and a 75 cent diet coke, it has become much beloved staple of my diet. So... WHY?! Why is this restaurant boarded up and strung with yellow "do not cross tape"?! Why is it not open and feeding my insatiable appetite for cheap, delicious sandwich?! Health code violation? Break in? I don't know. I just hope it's not forever. Sigh. YUM. Long lines.Amazing cheep food. If you like the sandwiches, the vegetarian ones here are amazing and cheep. there are lots of Asians and whiteys at all times, as well as every other nationality. this place is seriously SO good.It crosses all boundary's of color or creed. the only bad thing might be that there are no seats and it's far from other stuff for most people. Go here. Was brought here today for a late lunch/early dinner and I must say awesome banh mi (ordered the tofu myself and my sweetie ordered the chicken...which was pretty tasty too) as well as iced French coffee!!About shit myself over the prices too....total was $3.75 ($2.25 for the sandwich and $1.50 for the coffee). What a kickin little "hole in the wall" discovery, and great for those on a tight budget.Only draw back here though is that in tis place you need to be quite assertive when placing your order, otherwise you can very easily get overlooked. Great food...great price. &#160;Friendly service. &#160;The sandwiches are second to none...but do try the hot food. &#160;Really tasty! If you have never been here, there are some things you should know:1) The outside looks sketchy, and parking is a little iffy.2) The inside is not a typical sit-down style restaurant. It's a deli. Grab your food and go.3) There might be a line. But the line moves fast, I promise!4) Pay in cash (but you won't need much--$10 will suffice, even if you bring an enormous appetite and a friend).The banh mi are phenomenal and cheap. I am a meat eater, but I especially like the banh mi with tofu. It has a crisp outer skin, a soft, delicate interior and a flavorful seasoning/marinade. Even if you think you hate tofu, you've got to try it--it's pretty spectacular this way. Everything else about the sandwiches is great, too--toasty baguette that's got a good, chewy, crust; lots of fresh veggies; delicious, tangy sauce. Sometimes I get the BBQ pork instead of the tofu. You can't go wrong with either! I tried the Saigon Deli today. I have to admit that I thought for the price my sandwich that its was not bad. I don't think I'd eat here every day because normally I like to avoid waiting in large lines and its not so oftern that I find myself in that paticular part of Seattle but I think their food is pretty darn good for low budget eats. I was a slightly turned off at first by how crusty my sandwich bread was but I still liked the taste my sandwich over all. If anyone decides to eat at this place for their first time I'd suggest for them to keep in mind that there are no chairs or tables for customers to eat at inside Saigon Deli and that it can be a pretty busy place to try to order from. Another great Vietnamese deli in Seattle. Has the usual a la carte items on display, French Press ice coffee and so forth. We grabbed some coffee and Banh Mi Dac Biet to go. Earlier this summer I said Saigon Banh Mi in New York City is the best I ever had. Well...Saigon Deli in Seattle is the best I ever had. Crispy baguette, well prepared fresh, and a good amount of filling. Not just fillers but a nice portion of deli meat with a balance of pickled carrots/radish.Along with being good, it's cheap, that's the Vietnamese way. Our friend knows the people at the deli, so I don't know if they made an exceptional Banh Mi for us. Nevertheless, it was damn good. Do yourself a favor and go here. DO NOT STAND BETWEEN ME AND THEIR BANH Mi!!!Dear Jesus, their sandwiches are amazing. The BBQ pork is to die for. I have tried all of their Banh Mis and they have all been good, but the BBQ pork is the best. The bread is always crispy, vegetables fresh, the sauce is tangy, and the pork is a slice of heaven. Crispy, fatty, tasty, and just amazing. When I think Banh Mi, I think Saigon Deli and so should you!!! Awesome Vietnamese deli for tasty, cheap eats!! Banh mi, hot foods, boxed lunches, desserts, drinks - you can easily get a meal here for under $5. My favorites are #2 banh mi(3 kinds of ham), vermicelli noodle bowl, and of course a deliciously strong iced coffee. See for yourself why this is one of the best banh mi joints in the ID! Ok, so the place seems dirty and the food appears to be sitting out for long periods of time, has no expiration dates, no prices, and may require refrigeration?? &#160;I didn't have a guide to tell me what everything was, so I only ordered &#160;Banh Mi and the banana fritter. &#160;The fritter tasted good, but tasted like it had been fried a long time ago. &#160;Tried 3 sandwiches, the grilled pork #1, BBQ pork, and the dac biet 3 meat. &#160;All except the #1 grilled pork had chichen liver pate spread on them. &#160;I can't stand chicken liver, so be warned. &#160;This ruined the sandwiches for me, except for the #1, which was delicious. &#160;Veggies and bread were fresh. The Banh Mi I ate at the Signature and at Pacific Grill in Tacoma were better.This place seems to be popular because it is cheap, and it is, but you get what you pay for. &#160;Go in, push to the front, yell #1 and bring $2.75 in cash. Saigon Deli is one of those rare places where half the pleasure of the meal is how little you had to paid for it. My tofu banh mi was $2.25 INCLUDING TAX and it was HUGE. I like my banh mi with fried egg in it, but I happily took that baby home and fried up an egg myself. The egg, and homemade dressing, were the only ingredients that banh mi was lacking compared to the one at Cafe Pho. But it was half the price! Five stars well-deserved! Delicious. I'm reviewing Seattle Deli and Saigon Deli back to back so there will be similarities.It was a Banh Mi weekend for me, having hit Seattle Deli on Friday night and then Saigon Deli on Saturday Afternoon. Just like Seattle Deli, Saigon Deli deserves 4 1/2 stars than 4 stars that I'm allowed to give it.I personally like the Banh Mi Thit Nuong at Saigon Deli more only because the pork they used is more lean. I came in Saturday afternoon and ordered 2 Banh Mi Thit Nuong, 2 quails and 1 sesame seed fried ball (I think that's what they're called). Service was just fabulous. I was able to strike up a conversation with the workers there and they are really nice. Food was great as usually. The marinate that they used on the quail was amazing. It went great with Coronas.One drawback is the lack of parking. Other than that. This place is a must. And this is why I love yelp. &#160;How the heck else would me (and my mother/fiance/grandmother troupe) find this sort of a place? &#160;We spent, like, 11 dollars on 3 sandwiches and a thing of spring rolls. &#160;My vegetarian, banh mi averse, fiance finally was able to taste banh mi, and he was pleased. &#160;I didn't try his tofu sandwich, but he tends to be skeptical of tofu and found it fantastic. &#160;My mother and i each had the grilled pork version, which was excellent, although they used quite a bit of mayo. &#160;I never eat mayo on sandwiches normally, but I make exceptions for banh mi... but, I still try to avoid being reminded of its presence. &#160;The jalapenos were pleasantly spicy, which is something I want in a good banh mi. &#160;My grandmother stayed in the car, and gave us funny looks when we returned with our sandwiches. Banh mi!Once upon a time, many years ago, this place was located across the street. Same owners, and same staff. One of the many things I love about Seattle is the available selection of cheap, quality ethnic food. For $5, you can pick up an iced coffee with condensed milk, and a Vietnamese style sandwich. My favorite: Grilled chicken, with pate. Warmed bread that's soft, yet crispy, with a good balance of veggies and meat. Perfection. I love their deep fried egg rolls, and well, deep fried anything. Personally, I'm not a fan of sweet rice, sticky rice, and hum bao's, but they have a nice selection - plus, deli style food if you're adventurous. Another one of my favorites are their boxed rice noodles with chicken or fish balls. SO GOOD. It's about $3.50 - at restaurants, they charge up to $12 for the same amount of food. Quick and easy, best way to be satisfied on a budget. As another reviewer stated, there's not much of a line system - I just walk in, smile at the ladies, and tell them what I want, they're efficient regardless.So...is it the best in town? That's debatable. But, I am fan!Ps...bring cash. They charge for transactions under $10 on credit cards. Can't beat the value and excellent food. &#160;The Banh Mi are excellent! &#160;$2 for two Summer roles that are some of the best I've had. &#160;It looks like chaos on the weekends during lunch but they still get your order right. &#160;I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I just had a couple of banh mi from Saigon Deli yesterday -- and they were gooood.. However, I have to take two stars away. Today I went back for some more banh-mi lovin' and to try some of the cakes / desserts available. I picked a green cake available from the table across from their counter, also got a couple of banh mi to go. As soon as I got home, I looked at the green cake again, and they were moldy all over. Little white fuzz on the cake slices. Should I have been more careful ? yes, no doubt.. but they should really toss away inedible desserts that have been sitting without refrigeration for a while. Moral of the story - only get banh mi from Saigon Deli, nothing else. OMG, if Saigon Deli was a man, I would marry it. &#160;I have so much love for the banh mi here.First timers- &#160;Bring cash, you only need like $3. &#160;And don't be alarmed by the appearance of this deli. &#160;So it looks a little sketchy, but the sandwiches. &#160;Oh god the sandwiches. &#160;I ate so many banh mi the week before I moved from First Hill that the roof of my mouth was all cut up from the crusty baguettes. &#160;My car has a perpetual layer of crumbs. &#160;A colony of ants could have a heyday in there!I want to talk about the chicken sandwich. &#160;So first of all you will find no one more picky about chicken. &#160;It has to be breast, white meat with no funky "bits" in it. &#160;This chicken meets my requirements. &#160;It's shredded and seasoned perfectly. &#160;The other parts of the sandwich are great: yummy mayo, the "slaw", cilantro and jals. &#160;Although sometimes the jal peppers kill me. &#160;One time it made my lip red and swollen and the guy at All the Best Pet store asked if I was ok. &#160;I'm just sensitve to hot peppers though. &#160;The baguette is perfection. &#160;Warm and fluffy with a crunchy crust.Saigon deli is take out only and charges a fee for using credit cards. &#160;But seriously the change in your couch will buy you heaven.Give this place a shot. &#160;You will be back for more...and more.... and more! Amazing. Best Vietnamese sandwiches in town, and super cheap too. DELICIOUS bahn mi sammies. &#160;The only thing that scares me is that their pre-made food (vermicelli dishes, spring rolls, etc.) sit out unrefrigerated for who knows how long. &#160;That said, I've never gotten sick from eating here. &#160;I love their grilled pork bahn mi (#1) and their shrimp spring rolls. &#160;The veggies on the sandwich are always fresh &amp; crunchy and their sauce is always perfectly tangy. &#160;Their $2.50 (+/-) sandwiches make for a cheap and seriously tasty lunch if you're ever in or near the ID. This place is just like one of my favorite banh mi joints about two blocks away (also ends with "Deli"). &#160;They offer a bunch of dishes you can choose from in their hot foods counter, as well as baked goods and other pre-made (freshly made) sides. &#160;I usually go to Saigon Deli for their BBQ banh mi sandwiches. &#160;I think they serve up some of the best in the city. &#160;The prices are very reasonable (but not the cheapest) at a little over $2. &#160;You can't beat a quick and &#160;fresh sandwich like this. Yes! I love this place! &#160;I know that all the Vietnamese delis in the International District are called Saigon Deli and that's hilarious as well as confusing, but this is the one you should really go to.Great made-to-order banh mis in many varieties: barbecue pork, chicken, tofu, ham, etc. &#160;Scattered on the table tops are boxed vermicelli noodles and steamed rice noodles that make great take-to-work lunches. &#160;They also have a selection of hot steam tray dishes such as sweet and sour soup, sauteed green beans and braised pork. Absolutely no seating here, it's strictly a take-out spot. &#160;Just come here and stock up and you won't have to cook or make lunch again for the rest of the week. &#160;The fact that it's cheap only makes it that much better. Their banh mi is good... for $2 you get lots of meat, crunchy veggie.I usually go for their ala carte food on the hot plates, and the ones on the table...it's pretty goodFor $5 you can get lots of good stuff to last you until dinner time or even lunch the next dayQuick, cheap - what else can you ask for Good deli food. A gaunlet for a parking lot..So I just park on the street.Food here is good, cheap and quick to get.Desserts are good and so are the hot foods. Sandwiches are ok, not the best, but ok.You go in, order and get out as quick as possible so no one dings your car. Enjoy! For one reason or another, it is beyond me how our handle on the Vietnamese language has not improved considering our frequency at numerous Vietnamese delicatessens and restaurants. However, lucky for us, Saigon Deli is one of the rare establishments in the International District where lack of comprehension of the language does not inhibit the experience of the delicatessen. A majority of the offerings are prepared fresh daily before being sealed into trays and stacked neatly on a display table. As for the Vietnamese sandwiches, banh mi for native speakers, each sandwich is prepared with vegetables provided in a separate container which is a good alternative for those ordering in bulk as as it allows the sandwiches to be stored for a few days without fear of the baguette taking on moisture and becoming disgustingly soggy. Aside from the sandwiches, our visits typically end with a bag full of banh cuon tom and soi lap xuong which can be found on the display table along with a delicious unnamed dish that we can only refer to as rice slugs. The banh cuon tom is a traditional dish with rice coins topped with beans and shrimp with a dash of onion and a side of fish sauce while the soi lap xuong is your basic sticky rice topped with pork and shrimp with onion to garnish. As for the unnamed and inappropriately described dish, the construction of the snacks are beans and shrimp stuffed within a rice sleeve and neatly wrapped in banana leaves served with a side of fish sauce. Each dish contains about eight to twelve of these snacks and they are a step away from a miniature dance party in the mouth. Saigon Deli is worthy of a visit when venturing about the International District and if you can overcome the initial sketchy character of the area you can reward yourself with a week or two worth of Vietnamese cuisine. And for anyone that can report back to us about the proper Vietnamese name for our unnamed dish we would be infinitely grateful. Our guess is that it is called banh bot loc, but we are just simple Chinese people taking shots of broken Vietnamese in the dark.Also, this can be taken as a generalization for any establishment in the Little Saigon section of the International District, but be sure to bring cash because it transactions seem to always work out more smoothly as a result. Looks dumpy, but with the windows open, it is really nice inside. You sort of seat yourself after making eye contact with the person running the restaurant. Today it was a nice lady, who even while really busy was able to smile and be gracious. I got the noodle bowl with chicken. It comes with a small egg roll in the bowl. The vermicelli noodles seat on top of bean sprouts, there's also cilantro, lettuce and carrots in the bowl. It was very large, but delicious and well worth $6.50. There was a bit of a mix up because I thought I didn't want the egg rolls, so I ended up with an order of spring rolls by mistake, They are like spring rolls on steroids, really the largest I've ever been served and I could not finish both. I ordered two banh mi to go in BBQ chicken. They will put egg on these if you want, but I'm not used to that and plan to bring these home to keep in the fridge. They make them when you order them---I saw them toasting the bread in the back! I don't think you can ask for more than that for $2.75. They don't even mind if you sit and eat them in the restaurant. Everything comes with a side of yogurt if you want it, I didn't particularly care for it. PS, you only get charged to use your card for purchases under $6.They were able to handle an amazing amount of pressure when 10 guys came in and each ordered 2 sandwiches each. They somehow got the sandwiches made, the bills taken care of---each one rang up separately (!) and out of the restaurant, although the lady asked them to stay, in about 10 minutes. Amazing! This is a good place, you should seek it out.
So Capitol hill has all kinds of Thai food, all kinds of pho and all kinds of enlistees into the skinny jean army. What it doesn't have is a fully American Chinese restaurant that I like. Until Now. Drum roll and ta da Chungees.A great local place filled with great mix of neighbors and wonderful Generals Tso's. The service is friendly and honest. The first night I went my date left her wallet with 300 cash in it and the next day it was there with all of its money intact. The second visit we ordered the Prawn and was informed that today the beef would be better. Just really nice people with decent food. I have read a few reviews on the food and for the most part I agree with both the good and the bad but really I just like this place and am working my way through the menu with little disappointment.The interior is intimate with a fun little bar up front and upstairs seating that feels as if you are in a fort. They have only been open a few weeks and they are working out some kinks. Not a big fan of the fluorescents they had going on the second visit but I will be back again and again. Yay Chungees.Just a note* went back a third time with friends the flurescents were not on (YAY!) and everything we orderd was great! It's probably more of a 4.5 star, but I couldn't find a reason to dock a full star from the review - and let's be honest, I was pretty impressed.Five of us came here last night. My expectations were mixed, as the Yelp reviews I'd read were mixed as well. The place is tiny, with more counter space than tables, but we managed to snag a table for our party. Lucky, because later on in the night I actually heard the bartender turning people away because they were completely full. (Yeah, not hard to do in such a tiny space, but clearly people were coming for a reason.)The space is pretty cute, but I hardly noticed it because I was focused on the food! We ordered the Chungee pancake (standard scallion pancake, here served with a green curry dipping sauce), the honey sesame chicken, the General Tso's chicken, beef with Chinese broccoli and vegetable chow fun. It was all very, very tasty. The General Tso's is just as good as everyone says it is, lightly breaded and tangy-sweet. The beef was tender and the Chinese broccoli wonderfully crisp. The honey sesame chicken was fresh and sweet and light and saucy and the chow fun was good, although it lacked heat - but that's what the chili oil on the table is for! Perfectly delicious. We each ordered a beer or a mixed drink, and at least my Sailor Jerry's and Coke was quite strong. Our server was spirited and fun, joking around with us and doing a great job of bringing and clearing plates (too many for the tiny table) without trying too hard. Some of our friends checked out the patio and said it was cute, so it'd probably be a great place to come on summer evenings. Our bill came to $75 - for 5 people stuffing themselves and getting a drink to boot. Delicious food, welcoming, saucy service and a fun atmosphere will have me becoming a regular for sure! I really would like to give this place a good review. &#160;I live so close and it would be nice to see a restaurant do well in this space. &#160; However, if they are still so unorganized that they are in a kind of soft-opening phase after two months in business, they really should not be charging full prices for poor-quality food.I could go on in further detail but the owner - who spent most of the night schmoozing with the older couple across from us - acknowledged that they were still 'working out some kinks.' &#160;He could see we did not eat our food and waited 20 minutes for our check and it was nice of him to offer us free cocktails but really, we should have received an abbreviated bill. &#160;(In this situation, I could not ask for a reduction having made exchanges in a dish.) &#160;But maybe you should not listen to me right now. &#160;I am sick and grumpy and if I had just had some hot and sour soup, maybe I would not have come down with bronchitis. &#160; Try it out for yourself. OMG Chinese food on the Hill. They are not yet offering their full menu, tonight was mostly things out of the deep fryer. But this little place is not too bad. The ginger pancake (really a &#160;green onion pancake with no hint of ginger) was not the best but certianily not the worst I have ever had, pot stickers (so/so) and the spring rolls. Also some good noodles, two different fried chicken in sweet sauces dishes and Gail Lan in oyster sauce. Was it great Chinese food? Not yet. Is it 50 feet from my house? YESThis was their first night open so I expect I will up my star rating once they get going a bit. The service was very attentive, and I can't wait to go back. I'm confused. The food was good but the service was awkward and the crowd that was in there was awful. I'm really hoping the self admitted 39 year old married man loudly talking about how fucking 17 year olds is hot was a fluke for this place...I also hope the bartender who told me I could sit at the bar with these awful people and receive good service or sit at a table alone and read and get terrible service. His words, not mine. I had been here once before and the food I got was not very good. It was decent fried rice full of hard small chunks of frozen veggies that I had to douse in soy sauce and chili oil. However, the bartender was a total sweet heart and the happy hour beers were cheap. That was a good experience.This time it was just the opposite. Not so nice and awkward service... a horrible crowd... but the food had improved by far and there were big chunks of delicious fresh veggies and it was seasoned to perfection.I'm so confused. NOTE: &#160;I went on opening night when they were still working things out.The decor was nice, and the service was friendly. &#160;My main remarks are about the food.First and most importantly, this is Americanized Chinese. &#160;I prefer Chinese Chinese, but I worked a good number of years (5+) at an Americanized Chinese place, so I have a good sense of what's what. &#160;They do have a few traditional/authentic menu items like the Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce that someone ordered and it looked pretty good, but mostly it's stuff like General Tso's, Chow Mein, and the like.Looking to see whether it was truly Americanized-only or Americanized + bonus authentic dishes, I ordered the Salt and Pepper Squid. &#160;The portion was quite generous, but the taste was way on the salty side. &#160;Even my salt loving self couldn't stand having more than a few pieces before informing the staff. &#160;I imagine that at a later time they'd fix this, but it's unimaginable how someone could have gotten the proportions so wrong. &#160;Seriously... each piece tasted like downing a spoonful of salt. &#160;When we informed the staff, at first we were offered the squid at half price, but after they realised what we were tasting, we were offered to order something else instead. &#160;By this time I had decided that this was clearly an American-Chinese only joint, so I ordered the General Tso's. &#160;Personally, I'm used to huge chunks of chicken, but I know that's not the norm. &#160;Chungee's features medium pieces of chicken with a fair amount of batter - just about as much as you could put on without being too much. &#160;The chicken pieces were crispy and the chicken wasn't overdone. &#160;Perhaps slightly heavy on the sauce, but not by too much. &#160;Overall, the General Tso's earned a solid 3-4.In the intermission we were also treated to an egg roll. &#160;It was cooked well, but was nothing remarkable in terms of the filling. &#160;For those who care, they use a thin egg roll wrapper.Overall, I really wish this place was better since it's so ridiculously close to where I live, but it needs some work. &#160;Today was day one, but hopefully they can get things ironed out by the time they have the opening festivities on Chinese New Year. I also went to Chungee's opening night, and like a previous poster, live about 50-100 feet away which earns an instant hooray (note: I never went to Esmeralda - not even once)...but I love Chinese food.It IS Americanized Chinese food as previously mentioned, but I would say that the quality was good and the owners are really nice people who make you feel very welcome. &#160;The food took forever to come out, but it WAS opening night and they were busy (it was about 6pm).I ordered the Ma Po Tofu and my boyfriend and I shared the veggie chow mein. &#160;I don't usually like thick noodles - but their noodles were quite good and I've had a little craving for them ever since. &#160;The Ma Po tofu was spicy and very typical of how this dish is usually prepared. &#160;By the time my boyfriend's General Tso's chicken came out, he was too full to eat more than a few bites but he gave it a thumbs up and ate the rest of it the next day.The atmosphere is cozy, my only criticism would be the exposed part of the florescent lights in the back of the restaurant. &#160;The bar area is a fun place to hang out, have a drink and a casual dinner and chat with your neighbors.Overall, I'm really happy this little place opened at the end of my street and I plan to be a regular. &#160;:) After MONTHS of hearing about the awesome green onion pancake from our friends, I finally got to try it myself when they had a joint birthday party last weekend at Chungee's.They reserved the patio for the event, which worked out very well. We were a little concerned about the chilliness, but the patio is covered with those thick clear vinyl strips for insulation, and they provided a MONSTER space heater that was almost too hot! (Almost.) The patio has nice ambient lighting and strings of festive Xmas lights - you will get stared at by passerby on the street, but they're probably just jealous that they're not partying with you! The patio probably comfortably seats about 15, but we had more like 20+, so that combined with servers made it a little crowded at times. Some people just went to the bar for drinks because it was faster.Drink prices were fair, and the staff was friendly and helpful (separate checks for everybody!) despite a language barrier at times. We ordered some appetizers to share, and the green onion pancake w/curry dipping sauce was pretty darn good (though Seven Stars Peppers is still the best). The eggrolls and potstickers were also tasty, with very good dipping sauces. Last call was at midnight before they closed up, so plan your party accordingly or be ready to take it somewhere else if you want to keep celebrating. Overall, it was a fun place for an event and I'd like to go back and try the food for a regular meal, too. Wow, the previous Yelpers weren't kidding -- the General Tso's chicken here is really good. I've never been compelled to Yelp a restaurant based on General Tso's chicken, for crying out loud, but the way Chungee's makes theirs is definitely worth checking out. It's not overly battered, so you don't feel like you're eating a chicken nugget that's already been sauced. They use dark meat chicken (which suits me just fine because I'm a fan of dark meat), and it's cooked just to the point that it's done, so it's not overdone and rubbery. So yeah, try the General Tso's.My husband had the Beef and Chinese Broccoli, and that was great, too. Again, the meat was perfectly cooked and tender. I also like that they used Chinese Broccoli instead of the regular -- it makes it feel healthier, for one thing, and also it makes the dish feel special. I took my order to-go and didn't have the chance to stay in, but I will definitely consider it for the next time. It's a cozy little place with a &#160;neighborhood feel. The people there were really friendly and nice, which was great. Also, for those who might be food sensitive (like I am) -- they might use MSG. I'm not 100% sure, but afterwards I got that MSG feeling, so the next time I'll just ask 'em not to include it (just in case they do). I think the only thing that keeps this place from making it to 5 stars in my Yelp-iverse is that they don't offer brown rice as an alternative to white. Don't get me wrong -- I'm Indonesian and LOVE me some white rice, but I'm really trying to change my habits and be more open to healthier brown rice (though that's probably a moot point anyway if I'm ordering General Tso's chicken. Baby steps, though! Baby steps!) So yeah, it's Americanized Chinese food, but it's good, fairly inexpensive, and you don't have to head down to the ID. That makes Chungee's a winner in my book. The best general tso's chicken I have ever had. &#160;No joke. &#160;They did a great remodel and have a cool little bar. &#160;When the sun comes out this summer and spring, the outdoor area here will be sweet. &#160;Glad to see that this is a very &#160;nice chinese (I believe cantonese) style menu will all the familiar dishes, not some pan asian fusion where you can get a phad thai wrap or a kimchee burrito, and not some cop out teriyaki joint. &#160; Very friendly and fast! I didn't know what to expect- if it was a take out place, but it is really more of a nice little dining atmosphere with reasonable prices. &#160;Check it out &amp; welcome these guys to the neighborhood- so glad that this is on 12TH! Good selection of beer and liquors with a super friendly bar staff. Patio seating is a huge plus. Mid-range prices, kitschy atmosphere and big servings. Man, great food, owner greated us at the door, great bartender, super cooks in the back! East meats west in the best possable way!! 3 stars but I would defnitely go back. &#160;We ordered it to go and it was ready FAST but....rice was steaming hot and entrees not. Hmmmmm. &#160;Not overly generous considering the price so that should be modified. &#160;Very friendly staff and very cute and cozy interior. &#160;The tiny bar is inviting but all of it is super small. &#160;Don't think I'd want to be in there if it was packed. &#160;Easier to park here than many places on the hill so try it! &#160;Hope it can make it. I was really excited to try chinese on capitol hill, but was disappointed by chungee. &#160;first of all the address is wrong on yelp. &#160;It is actually 1820 12th (12th and denny). &#160;The general tso's was too wet with too much batter on the chicken, far from the best in seattle. &#160;I have nothing to report on our other dishes ( kung pao beef, ma po tofu and chow phuen) as all &#160;were way too bland and forgettable. We liked it! &#160;After a round of golf on a beautiful sunny day, it was what we wanted. &#160;Ordered cocktails. fried chicken wings and beef chow phun. &#160;The wings were hot, crispy and tasty! &#160;The chow phun was flavorful and the portions was really generous. &#160;I am so excited to have good Chinese food on Capitol Hill!
I have only been to this restaurant one time which was with a large group of people and was thoroughly impressed by the quality of food and service that we received. From the outside you wouldn't think much of the place, but as we all know, these often turn out to be those hidden gems that you wish were on every street corner instead of all those fast food joints.Our group ordered family style so were able to try a really good variety of dishes and the quality of the food here was very good. From the fall off the bone ribs to the amazing gnocchi that everyone was raving about this was an outstanding meal. One of the groups' other favorite items was the pear salad with blue cheese and a vinaigrette dressing.The atmosphere was very intimate although it was to the point of being a little cramped, but that might have also been because we were such a large group. The staff here handled our group pretty well as they scrambled to get all of our dishes out as quickly as they could. Not sure if I would want to have a big group here again, but I would say this is an ideal spot for a nice quiet dinner date or just hanging out with a couple close friends. As if it was plucked from Italy and dropped in Rainier Beach. The restaurant ambiance and decor will transport you to a different country without a passport. I don't think many southenders know about this Italian restaurant because many went to Vince's. Since Vince's closed I think people are either going to Southcenter or Columbia City for Italian food. Caf&#233; Vignole's menu is authentic. I had the Ravioli al Pomodoro e Basilico (Ravioli with tomato sauce and Basil) &amp; Insalata di Pera (Pear Salad). The salad was large and I shared it with another person. The ravioli was satisfying. Friends at our table ordered off of the special menu and one of the items was the crab ravioli dish. Another friend from our table ordered the snapper fish dish. Everyone enjoyed their food. Service was great. Our water was always filled and the owner was very friendly. Any restaurant or employee who makes me feel like family is good in my book. Mmmm.... Gorgonzola Gnocchi.Ah yes, Cafe Vignole. Solid 4 1/2 stars. Im sure this will hit 5 in no time. You walk in and think you are being welcomed by an extra from the Sopranos. This guy's accent is thick (and so is &#160;his chest hair). But he is friendly, attentive, and the quintessential Italian. He''ll make you feel like you are at home.(Gorgonzola Gnocchi.)This place is small, but very cute. &#160;Granted I was part of a large UYE party (about 25 of us...I think?) so the seating arrangements were banquet table like. Im sure on a less auspicious occasion with a smaller party the seating would be spacious and comfortable. Given the fact I was nestled right next to a large group of yelpers, I can't complain about tight quarters. The other diners looked more than fine.(Gorgonzola Gnocchi.)I also have to say I love how this place is decorated. You have semi-dim lighting over all sorts of custom artwork that we will call...eclectic. Zombies getting eaten by a giant fish? A super skinny chicken? More fish and some interesting looking portraits? It's all there and it is all great. (Gorgonzola Gnocchi.) Then the food! The food!!! I was lucky enough to be treated to a "family style" meal when basically all the "big dishes" from the menu were served. A brilliant pear salad. Flavorful ribs that fell off the bone! I picked that sucker clean (and I don't normally like ribs). A wonderful white fish sauteed in some sort of citrus and capers. It was moist and firm and delicious. Ravioli with a surprisingly flavorful and yummy marinara. And my favorite, the Gorgonzola Gnocchi. They were perfect little potato pillows drenched in plate-licking good gorgonzola cream sauce and topped with walnuts. I could eat that every day for the rest of my life and be happy. (Fat....but happy).And don't forget dessert! &#160;The owner was kind enough to give us a sample tray -- with an amazing tiramisu, and lovely red velvet cake, and the star treat; the black-eyed pea cake. It is what everyone says it is - spicy, sweet, and not too rich. &#160;A definite must have.My only complaint was the service was slow -- but there were 25 of us. We always had water and bread at the table, so we weren't overlooked -- I think the kitchen just had troubles keeping up.Im planning on going back very soon. Cuz I want some more of that gorgonzola gnocchi. I went here with a group of Yelpers and had a blast! We ate family style and there was something for everybody- vegetarian and carnivores alike.When my partner in crime, and the last of the stragglers arrived, the waiter immediately got the wine and bread to our end of the table. This is very important folks, and because everything was being cooked fresh, there was a wait. I think there were only two people working that night (cook and waiter) so this was no small feat and nobody wants a bunch of loud, hungry people waiting, therefore we must be subdued with wine and bread.Most of the appetizer plates had all veggie dishes, except for one meat which I liked, and the bread was steaming hot and fresh. I ate the pear salad, gnocchi, &#160;whitefish(?), bread (yes, I liked the bread, OK!). Nothing was smothered in sauce as so many faux Italian places like to do. This meal was simple and had great flavors.Negative: Because I don't drive, the location really stinks.Positive: Service, food and atmosphere. ***GODFATHER FAMILY STYLE****Our Yelper mafia of 25 ate family style here...forgetaboutit.Do you have faith in my judgement? Do I have your loyalty? Then be a friend to Cafe Vignole.Pros:Generous pours of wine and the two kinds of bread dip in olive oil &amp; balsamic vinegarPear Salad - the vinaigrette dressing was addicting top by gorgonzola cheeseRibs - The meat was so tender and flavorfulGnocchi - The richness of the sauce combine with a soft texture of goodness, I kind of like it al denteRavoli - It was stuffed with spinach with a fresh tomato sauce. Red Snapper fish - butterly flakey moist.Black eyed pea cake was tasty but I didn't care for the Red Velvet or Tiramisu...too much cream not enough layers.Cons: Small dining areaHard to find location but plenty of parking on the streets.The endless walk ins from random people can be annoying meal experienceOverall the food was amazing while the owner did his best to take care of us even if he was getting overwhelmed by us 25 yelpers. I thought it was a great dinner family style when we only paid $35 a person for such a great meal. My hats off to Clover for setting this up and a wonderful time.TIP: If you on a diet, do sit by D because he will eat all the food so you can control your portions. If you want a romantic, ask for the table by the window since it is far enough away to be on your own island and away from noise of loud yelpers like us. lol While I may be an Italia-phile, I am generally not an Italian food snob and have been known to eat at Olive Garden on rare occasion. &#160;That said, I can distinguish between good, relatively authentic Italian food and Italian junk food. &#160;As the other reviews convey, Vignole falls into the former category.Our large group took over the restaurant (sorry if you were one of the handful of other people who made the mistake of coming in last night) and hopefully the owner isn't regretting his decision to let us in the door because I'd really like to go back! &#160; We dined family-style with a pre-set menu, which was a brilliant idea as the kitchen couldn't keep up even with these simplifications. &#160;I dread to think how managing 25 disparate orders would have turned out. &#160;Our tables were laden with water, red wine, and bread with oil and vinegar to start. &#160;Then came an antipasti plate with a variety of nibbles including beets, mozzarella, and a few other items I've forgotten. &#160;The salad with pears and a vinaigrette was among my most favorite items of the night. &#160;Delicious!Then came a really long delay as the kitchen worked on the entrees. &#160;I don't really hold this against the restaurant as serving a crazy group of demanding Yelpers can challenge the most organized and speedy of restaurants. &#160;And the owner did a great job coming around the tables and making sure we had water, etc. to keep us going.The entrees were, in order of favorite to least: *ribs - tender and yummy. The meat just fell off the bone.*gnocchi - YUM! Gave the ribs a run for the money, but didn't care for the sensation of them sticking to the roof of my mouth. &#160;I'll deal with it to eat more of the yummys though.*ravoli - stuffed with spinach I think, in a fresh tomato sauce. Very good.*fish - also good, but not sure we should have finished with the fish as it wasn't as impressive as the other dishes for me.And finally dessert. Oh my word. &#160;Tiramisu, one of the better ones I've found outside of Italy (ok, I'm a tiramisu snob, I admit it!). &#160;Red velvet cake, which isn't a traditional Italian dessert, but when it's this tasty, who cares? &#160;And the star of the evening: black eyed pea cake. &#160;I never knew any kind of pea could be turned into a dessert, let alone one so delicious. &#160;It reminded me of a spice cake, and if I hadn't already been so full, I'm not sure my neighbors would have gotten to try any.I've been looking forward to trying this place for awhile now, and I'm happy to say that it did not disappoint in the slightest. Another great experience with Yelpers, The UYE Italian dinner! Thanks Clover for setting it up! And, I was happy to see Jennifer L there :-)$35 (with tips) family style Italian food: One glass of red wine, 5 different appetizers, 2 kinds of breads, Pear Salad with Gorgonzola cheese, Gnocchi, Ravoli, Ribs, Fish, and Trio desserts.I feel that the owner might have been overwhelmed with about 20-25 of Yelpers and 2 or 3 other tables of customers. However, he insisted to take of us. And, he really tried to keep up with the group. My favorite dishes of the night were: Gnocchi and Pear Salad with Gorgonzola cheese. The Gnocchi was cooked just right (not tough and not soggy). The cheese sauce was very smooth and tasty. Pear Salad came with vinaigrette dressing and gorgonzola cheese was really good. And, I am out of words to describe that! I was here with a big group of Yelpers for a UYE, and I have to say, this is my kind of place. &#160;Cafe Vignole is a nondescript location in the Rainier Valley in a really great neighborhood. &#160;I had to walk to find an ATM and walked past a barbershop that looked like something right out of, well, "Barbershop". &#160;This is a real vibrant and diverse neighborhood and while some folks might find that to be a bit intimidating at times, I think it's fantastic. &#160;Anyway, I digress.Cafe Vignole is a real neighborhood type restaurant. &#160;One can't help but feel like they've been teleported into an oldskool Italian "legitimate businessman's club" somewhere on the East Coast. &#160;The decor is old and burnished and a mix of modern and eclectic pop art of the 50's/60's/70's graces the walls. &#160;It's dimly lit and would be romantic, though being surrounded by the stabbing forks and spoons of my fellow yelpers is not the most romantic scene.The food was quite good, we were treated to selection of dishes from the friendly and accomodating proprietor. &#160;There was some delay in getting food to the table but we were a huge group and by all appearances this is a two person operation. &#160;We tasted the anitpasto platter (delicious with herbs, olives, marinated mushrooms, beets, etc), a lovely pear and blue cheese salad with crushed pistachio, gnocci with gorgonzola (my favorite, the gnocci was light but with just the right amount of texture), ricotta stuffed ravioli with marina (really nice), and for desert a selection of tiramisu, red velvet cake, and the black eyed pea cake (all really good, Kira had the most promiscuous tiramisu spoon I've ever seen). &#160;All in all, my wife and I had a fantastic time, enjoyed the food, and would definitely go back again. Decor!Food!Rainier Beach!Small Business Owned!Customer Service!...what more is needed?...Excellent pear blue cheese pistachio sald and to die for gnochhi in a creamy sauce... yumMEEEEE!This is a one of kind spots... I love that its a small owned business, cute "hole in the wall", great food, and friendly authentic service.You will not be disappointed by your experience here! I've been dying to try this hidden little gem near my house and it was everything I had hoped for! Small, quaint, and an owner/waiter/bartender/chef who was charming and perfect. I almost hope nobody reads this review so that I can keep this restaurant my own little secret. First off-really good Italian food. Really good. Limited menu which I love, give me a few great choices, offer fresh specials, and make a recommendation. I'd venture to say it's the best Italian I've had in Seattle. We started off with the Grilled Romaine and Shrimp Salad. It was definitely large enough for the two of us to share, and had this fantastic house made dressing. A bit like Caesar, pink in color, and just the tiniest kick of heat. I had the pasta special of the evening-Lobster Ravioli. I have to say it's probably one of the best Lobster Ravioli dishes I've ever had. The pasta was perfectly cooked, stuffed full of Lobster (no fillers!!!), with just the lightest amount of sauce. If I had to make one critique, I'd say a bit more sauce but really it was as close to perfect as possible. My husband had the Rigatoni-I think he won! It was so flavorful, chocked full of a 3 meat combo, sweet tomatoes and again-perfectly cooked pasta. It was amazing! The wine list was limited and great pricing on bottles. The Pinot Grigio had a slight carbonation, very good! I love when the waiter brings the bottle to the table and pours right in front of you-it's the little touches! Oh and how can I not mention the desert-Red Velvet Cake with cream cheese frosting and marbling throughout! DELISH!Price wise it's right in the middle-$15-$20 per entree, so although it's not an every week stop, it's definitely not a special occasion price point either. I love this place, and I'll definitely be back again very soon! Now this is where you imagine dining when you think of authentic Italian fare. &#160;Hidden right off of Rainier Ave, it's in an unsuspecting location--but perfect in every way. &#160;The owner is from Lucca and has a great big inviting personality. &#160;He personally serves many of the patrons, and you can hear him singing from the kitchen. &#160;Our pasta was al dente, perfect with each bite. &#160;The dessert--oh the dessert. &#160;Choices of black eyed pea cake, red velvet cake, tiramisu... &#160;many of the desserts are baked by the owner's mother. &#160;Super moist, not overly sweet, and just all-around fantastic!Now that I read that there is a Brasilian singer performing on certain days, there is even more incentive to dine here! Wow, how have I missed this place?? Thank you Yelp for pointing me in the right direction. I've been driving past Cafe Vignole on my way to and from work for the past 4 years and never stopped in until recently. I took my out of town friend there for dinner. We started with a glass of wine (Montepulciano for me and Malbec for my guest) and the grilled pear and blue cheese salad. So, so good. The pears were grilled so perfectly. My guest had the spaghetti with calamari and I had the red snapper with capers and lemon. I wish we would have had room for the black eyed pea cake as it looked amazing. I suppose it's good to save something for next time. I can't wait to go back! "Straight outta Compton crazy motherf***r named Ice CubeFrom the gang called Niggaz With AttitudesWhen I'm called off I got a sawed offSqueeze the trigger and bodies are hauled off.."...was the soundtrack walking to the restaurant. It was Little Italy smack dab in the middle of Compton.It's not as bad as LA but still had the street urban feeling. &#160;UYE with yelpers is always a good time. If it includes food and drink even better. If it includes a wonderful atmosphere ...jackpot. And this my peeps was a winner. &#160;Great job Clover and DDD...Two tables consisting of new yelpers congregated to form a big happy new family. Bread arrived fresh and everyone dived in. Thrill told me he starved the whole day for this. &#160;Bottles of wine arrived ready for the antipasto (beets, spinach, salami). &#160;Conversation and nibbling were at hand. Kevin finally walks in after walking 20 blocks from the light rail. We seat him at the end of the table and start giving him plates. &#160;Pear salad arrives ..Peter who was across me....loved the dressing and crushed nuts on it. Ravioli stuffed with spinach arrives...Jen attacks it likes she had not ate in days. Plates are disappearing as they arrive. The pork Ribs arrive. We have a lot of vegetarians on our table so I feed the meat eaters. John Food Ninja and Marc step up. Meat falling off the bone good. Gnocchi arrives and this was a hit with everyone. Sandie and Melody could not &#160;stop talking about it. The fish with wine sauce and capers was last. Snapper was moist and flavorful. This was my favorite dish of the night. Having eaten in small cafes in Italy these dishes have that zing...that authentic fresh taste.Desserts...are made by the owners wife...a sample tray -- with an creamy tiramisu, and soft red velvet cake, and the signature black-eyed pea cake. Good Stuff....Sandro the owner.. did a good job with a full restaurant. Got to give him credit. He made you feel you were like in Tuscany or Lucca where he is actually from. Really a family operation. I really enjoyed &#160;seeing the kids of the hair stylist next door. Sit down like regulars at the bar and have dinner. Then the women hair stylist from the next building an hour later. A brother getting take out. Sandro really make them feel like family. Always conversing and laughing with them. Cafe Vignole is a true neighborhood gem. "So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duckCoz Ice Cube is crazy as f**kAs I leave, believe I'm stompinbut when I come back, boy, I'm comin straight outta Compton" This place is amazing, if your looking for the perfect date spot check this place out, very romantic, and the food is out of this world. &#160;The owner is very interactive with his guest and makes you feel very welcome. &#160;If you are looking for authentic Italian food, dine here tonight, you will not regret it. My favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle. The decor, the service, and especially the food is amazing. A small little gem that everyone must come try. A great place for romantic dinners as well! Great pear salad and awesome gnocchi! This place has gotta be on the top 3 best Italian food restaurants in Seattle! I liked everything about this cafe. &#160;The waiter/owner, the food and the setting itself. &#160;My family enjoyed the unhurried comfort of the place. &#160;Don't take that to mean slow because it was not. &#160;Everything we ate was delicious to include the pear salad with Gorgonzola and walnuts, spinach ravioli with basil, spicy spaghetti with calamari and a beautiful pork dish. &#160;We finished off with the famous black eye pea cake and red velvet cake. &#160;I will definitely keep this on the favorites list and visit as often as possible. GREAT!! &#160;Wonderful little restaurant. &#160;Normally, closed on Sundays, they opened up specially for our large family multiple birthday celebration. &#160;Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the food, cozy setting and good service. &#160;Definitely going there again. &#160;Oh, and the chicken meatball rigatoni with spicy marinara sauce was very very good. &#160;My son had baby back ribs melting off the bones and tasty roast potatoes. &#160;Endless supply of very good warm bread. &#160;Go there, you won't be disappointed. Had dinner with several real Italians the past week-end. &#160;Food was tasty but, in our opinion, overly salted; salad and dessert were the hightlights. Staff was minimal, but very effective, as was the decor. &#160;In a very strange part of town for this kind of restaurant. Might return, but was not overwhelmed. A lovely little restaurant with a very charming chef! &#160;The lobster ravioli and pasta with clams were excellent, as was the black eyed pea cake. &#160;As everyone says, it tastes like carrot cake...made by angels. &#160;The decor is really charming and the staff is friendly. &#160;The restaurant is a little way from downtown Seattle, but worth the trip! this is one of the great Italian food I have not had for long time since new york lower east side the service was great the owner really friendly the food was great &#160;the place really family style ,I will be back for more
Meh, after the anticipation had been built up, my initial impression was mediocre at best. &#160;Uppers: attentive table service, easy-on-the-eyes atmosphereDowners: drinks and dishes that don't equate with the prices or ambianceDon't get me wrong, the huge cherry blossom LED-lit tree in the center of the sushi and alcohol bars is spiffy, and the table service itself was great, but at this point I feel like I paid for the experience while my palate and wallet bitch-slapped me across the face as we were leaving. &#160;The sushi itself was pretty standard and lacked the gusto in taste/presentation to pull ahead from great places around the city (Umi in Belltown) that combine awesome food, in a great environment, at relative prices.TWO STAR COCKTAIL: What really hit home was the mixed drink/bar service. &#160;We had some hot Saki and a bottle of white that were fine, but prior to being seated, I grabbed a drink at the bar. &#160;I like hot (spicy) drinks. After glancing at the drink menu, each priced at/near $10, I asked the bartender whether he had any spicy cocktails he could recommend. &#160;He replied with one listed drink and said he had peppers in the kitchen that could be used as well (a pretty standard reply to my request to which I respond with a drink of choice and ask that jalape&#241;os, or the like, be muddled into the mix and normally the drink is awesome). &#160;I chose a gin concoction and asked that the peppers be used as well. &#160;After tasting the drink once, and muddling more pepper, he handed it to me, stating that it wasn't very hot. &#160;I tried it, and agreed, to which he responded by muddling some more pepper, returning it with "It's still not very hot, but it's a good drink." Shouldn't your customer be the final judge? The drink lacked many elements - overall, the soda water masked all other hints of flavor or heat and he strained out the pepper after I had requested that he not. &#160;He didn't ask what I thought nor made any effort to compensate. &#160;I get it - it's a crank request, but don't offer to create a spicy drink if you don't feel confident in mixing it. The bill grants a discount at their sister dive bar down the street which is a fun place, and they did give us a "Happy Holiday's" 20% off voucher for January/February, and as such, I will probably swing back in for a second round. I have been here on several occasions with groups of friends and I would have given it five stars except for the last two times I was there the service was horrible. The food is great and the drinks are super delicious. But...all of that can be forgotten when your server acts like you have interrupted her day to place an order and then forgets your table for 50 minutes... I tried better sushi restaurants. Expensive and not that great. But good service. Service was pretty good, but the sushi was not so good. &#160;The rice on the rolls seemed dry, and the crab in the california rolls was dry and chewy. &#160;For the price of the rolls, there is definitely way better sushi in this city. &#160;Save your money and go somewhere else. &#160;The cherry blossom tree was cool though. I love sushi, and some of the best I've had is at Moshi Moshi.I always get the Japanese pickles for a starter, yum!My first time there, looking through the menu, I thought the sashimi was a little over-priced, but when it got to the table, I was completely pleased with the value for money. BIG FAT slices of VERY FRESH sashimi.My only advice is not to sit at the bar, even if you have to wait a while for a table. Bar patrons are served by the bartenders, who are waaay too busy making their specialty drinks to be much of a server. I've always had very good service sitting at a table. The interior of the restaurant is inviting and reflects that odd appeal of cute Japanese modernism, but we had our inherent reservations about the menu as the prices seemed to be fairly low even in comparison to the happy hour menus at various similar restaurants. Although we had truly hoped to have discovered a novel Japanese restaurant in the Ballard neighborhood, a part of us were a bit disappointed to have had only one memorable dish; the agedashi tofu. Probably the cheapest dish out of our order, the agedashi tofus is served as four hefty cubes of fried tofu in a hot Japanese soy sauce topped with radish and scallions. While the tofu was cooked and flavored quite well, the tori kara age, which we are positive that it is spelled "karage", and the beef kushi sashi left us a bit less than impressed. Though the menu proclaims that the chicken is cooked with salt and lemon, the dish lacked flavor of any sort and beef skewers were equally unimpressive as the steak was fairly dry with an insufficient amount of pepper for proper seasoning. Our intentions were to establish the restaurant as one of our premier sushi restaurants in Ballard, but the establishment is fairly average compared to the standards of other Japanese restaurants in the Seattle area. We went here on date night, and this place gets an A for ambiance. The booths are cozy and the mammoth cherry blossom tree at the bar is a sight for sore eyes. Our waiter was perfectly friendly and recommended a killer beer that wasn't too hoppy (Fish Bone?). The rolls were good - nothing blew my socks off though, AND they were pricey. The fried tofu appetizer, which is usually one of my favorites, was a big disappointment. The tofu was a bit goopy for my taste, and the fried outer coating ran off in one big glump. The specialty drink menu looked killer, as did the happy hour menu. Moshi moshi should be called pricy pricy. I wanted to love this place. The decor, complete with the much mentioned sakura tree was gorgeous. It was comfortable without being pretentious and our waitress was absolutely incredible. Answered all my questions capably without batting an eyelash. But the dining experience left much to be desired.We ordered a number of rolls and a sushi platter. We got one roll.... and then waited another 20 or 30 minutes for the sushi. The timing was just off. When we did get our dishes, the portions were small and disappointing. Yes, the fish was fresh and tasted good. But after ordering $70 of food, we were still hungry. Both rolls and nigiri are quite small. The food itself was decently good. Yes, sushi is expensive. But Seattle has so many good sushi choices, that Moshi Moshi just gets lost in the crowd. There's nothing outstanding about it that justifies the price or would make me come back. For the value, its not worth a full priced dinner. Though I would consider it for happy hour. I love sushi. &#160;I mean, I L-O-V-E sushi... and I really want to love Moshi Moshi. &#160;But I can't. &#160;Attitude, short staffed, clueless front desk, oblivious servers. &#160;I understand it is a busy time of the year (I've worked restaurants and retail, truly, I get it) but there is no reason for the 'tude. &#160;Last night, we got a seat at the sushi bar, sat there for 10 minutes with not as much as a glance. &#160;More than enough to make us leave and head up to Sam's (where we had a great meal, quick service and great price). &#160;MMS - you get coal in your stocking this year. Wow! What a wonderful and chic place to have saki samplers and great cocktails. Kim was outstanding and knowledgable on his saki and drink choices. I can't wait to go here again to try some of the delicious sushi. Too bad I had already eaten before I arrived here while bar hopping. Love this place. Great atmosphere, nice decor and awesome service. Thanks for a great first time Moshi Moshi! See you very soon! It is kind of odd that their are 2 sushi places practically right next to each other (Shiku sushi is a few stores down). The sushi is good, not great. But I think it is the best in Ballard, and much better than Shiku. Shiku is more of a place to get elaborate rolls, while Moshi Moshi is more traditional sushi. The atmosphere is nice, open and airy. There is a bar with a decent selection of draft beers (more than just Japanese brands). Service is friendly and attentive. If you are in Ballard in need of a sushi fix, this would be my recommendation. went back here with some friends and it was about 1 star better. So thats good for them and you and me cause once you get into the 4 star range i feel comfy eating there more offten. So give it woral and see..I still heart the light up tree.. it is like super neat O. I tried this spot recently as my daughter and wife had raved about it. &#160;We went in during happy hour and had some great sushi - the quality of the fish and the presentation was top notch. &#160;The menu and assortment of rolls were also very good. &#160;We tried the chef's choice nigiri sushi and it did not disappoint at all. &#160; I also had some delicious agedashi tofu which was much better than other places - it was fried delicately and just right. &#160;I recommend going for happy hour - they have reasonable drink and food specials. &#160;The three of us had enough sushi and drinks for about $40.00, which is pretty amazing. &#160;The service was great too although it could have been because they weren't that busy at 5:30. &#160;This is worth a stop if you are in Ballard, I went to this place craving sushi with a friend of mine that works down the street last night. &#160;When we got there the receptionist asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar we said not really but she said there was going to be a long wait for a table so we went for the bar. &#160;tables opened up shortly after which sucks because they were giving to others. &#160;We ordered two rolls and agadashi tofu. &#160;our order was screwed up and they didn't bring any wasabi or soya sauce . &#160;I waited about 10 min for a new roll &#160;and then on top of it the food was really only mediocre. &#160;I can see it being OK if you are paying happy hour prices but really over priced for the quality and service. 7 $ for a roll. &#160;I will not go there again or recommend it . &#160;atmosphere is nice. Alas, &#160;things seem to have slipped here...and slipped badly. &#160;What was formerly top quality sushi has become closer to middling and very expensive middling it is. &#160;I don't mind paying a lot for o-toro if it's really good, &#160;but my last two servings here were not...and at $25 a serving, &#160;that's not cool. &#160;And more and more the focus here seems to be on "craft cocktails" which generally means that they can mix up a lot of fussy drinks containing okra-infused vodka, &#160;house-brewed Jollly Rancher bitters and garnished with live grasshoppers but they have trouble with a simple gin martini. &#160;On my last visit, &#160;the host of the evening was an ill-at-ease sort of aging frat boy who spent most of his time yapping on his cell phone even as he seated people and leaned over to pour them water...yeah, &#160;we know how busy you are but please don't treat us like WE'RE the problem. &#160; &#160; The earnest waitress screwed up about a third of my mitchen order, &#160;and seemed miffed when I cancelled something after she admitted she'd forgotten to put it in. &#160; Bottom line: &#160;when it opened, &#160;it was a quality sushi bar with a cocktail lounge...now it's a bar with glorified snacks. &#160;So long, &#160;it's been good to know ya. &#160;Oh yeah, &#160;the decorative tree is still there and is still &#160;beautiful...but you can see it easily from the street. **Review is solely based on Happy Hour** Been here a handful of times for either Happy Hour or late night. The space is just beautiful. Even though I've seen in a million times, that damn cherry tree just gets more and more awesome every time. Eric, is amazing. He creates one of the best dining/drinking experiences I've ever had. He is attentive, listens and if you ask nicely will create something totally special just for you. The cocktail list is extensive and amazing (all though not on happy hour prices) for those of you looking for a good deal - try the $2 tall boys of PBR. The rolls were good - fish was fresh and flavorful, and some of the choices were quite innovative. I thought I would start the new years off HEALTHY, and Moshi Moshi is your place. As a local Ballardite since 01, sitting there under neither sweet lighting of the cherry blossom tree with the sushi chefs right in front simply amazing. The service is OK, the sushi chefs are willing to teach you anything about nigiri, sashimi or just a different parts of a fish's body; which is more savory. Incredibly fresh fish, miso is warming and delightful. Extremely clean. Best time is with great with just some friends and family. Awesome for a casual date night. I would definitely go back . I think the best thing about Moshi Moshi is the awesome light up cherry blossom tree. The next best thing is the food, and its just alright. With so many good options for sushi in Seattle, Moshi Moshi would not be my first choice. The first time I went to Moshi Moshi they did not have any salmon. I was shocked, because this is Seattle and salmon is everywhere. The second time I went the food was much improved, and they had salmon, but I just don't think the sushi here is memorable, especially when Shiku is two doors down. I have to update my review based on the dinner I had at Moshi Moshi last night. Decided to trust the chef and try the omakase or "chef's choice" and was very happy with the meal. The sushi was fresh and flavorful, the salmon collar was rich and delicious, and the portions were very generous! This is quickly becoming my favorite sushi restaurant in Seattle. I'm a little biased because I've only been here on dates with the boyfriend, so happy memories are what I always think of. But, this place is great! I love the big cherry tree in the center of the restaurant. The sushi is good and they have some great deals on happy hour. It's never that hard to get a table, even on Valentines Day when we came in for a few bites. The service has always been friendly. No complaints! this place was beautiful inside, and the service was great! food was really good...but i just need to mention again that the servers were all SO NICE! I finally stopped in to Moshi Moshi with a friend for happy hour the other day. We had the spicy tuna rolls and the california rolls. The california rolls were a little inconsistent, but overall it was delicious.I recommend trying the sunset in padova, a nice and refreshing cocktail. Cute neighborhood, pretty sakura tree, modern decor, how can you not stop by this Japanese restaurant with such an adorable name? I've been here twice for happy hour, very happy customer both times! The prices are relatively cheap, $2-$6 for small plates, awesome to sample a bunch of varieties between 2-3 people! Runs all night long on Sundays too. Agedashi tofu ($2.95) is a MUST! Tori kara age ($3.95), juicy and tender small bites of fried chicken! Beef kushi sashi offers plenty tasty meat for a small price tag of $2.95. The sushi rolls for HH are pretty common, so I'd recommend getting more of the other small dishes or the nigiri set ($5.95).Really loved the decor of this place, with attentive service. Will try to come back for the full menu in the future. I came here last minute on a Saturday night with a group of 4, and we were seated immediately by a friendly, engaged waiter who was able to suggest the best fish of the day and recommend gin that suited my tastes perfectly. The rolls are consistently good here, and the Nigiri is fresh and flavorful, but their winning side is certainly service. Definitely go here if you want to feel like the bartender will remember your name and the waiter will be your future friend.What you won't find is any odd and stunning roll or exotic puffer fish, but I don't need those to be happy on a daily basis, so Moshi gets 2 thumbs up here! We had a 5 pm reservation but came in about 40 minutes early and ask if we could be seated. We were seated right away. We ordered:2 Sunset in Padova cocktails2 Shirley temples (tasty)1 spriteedamame (salty, but good)goma-ae (loved the spinach, no need for the asparagus)Vegi tempura (good)beef kushi sashi (2 skewers - my husband was wishing for 2 more for the price)california roll &#160;(my 12 year old said that there wasn't enough crab in the roll so she mostly tasted rice &amp; vegis)eel roll (again my 12 year old thought it was ok)spider-roll (a little on the wide side, but yummy)Mochi &#160;(We loved)vanilla ice creamOur bill was about $83 before our Groupon. It was a fun place to sit and people watch. Our server was on point through the entire dinner. I would go back for a few drinks and an appi just to get an evening started. I'm not sure I would go for an entire dinner. The bartenders make some ridiculously strong drinks, but it's pretty expensive, though the happy hour menu is decent. That being said, it's hard to justify spending money here, when it's in the middle of some awesome dive bars that are a little bit closer to Ballard's aesthetic. It's okay, I don't hate the place, it's just not the first place I would go to. Have been looking for a good sushi place for awhile and this came pretty highly recommended by my boss. Went in and was pretty impressed with the quality of fish. We started with the baby octopus which was deep fried... so good! We also had the Madi-san roll and the Spicy tuna which was hot! We also had the sushi and sashimi combo which was great. They are baby-friendly and for a Wednesday night it was really crowded. We went here for my daughter's birthday and the sushi chef carved a jack-0-lantern complete with candle and arms out of a grapefruit for her! &#160;The sushi was so fresh it was amazing and the crusted steak that my wife had was to die for. &#160;Excellent cocktails too. &#160; I like a list that has bourbon used in other ways besides your typical Manhattan and they have perfected some mighty tasty concoctions! &#160;Service was excellent--attentive and friendly. Solid sushi here, and so much more!While I tend to prefer just sushi, they're doing all thing Japanese, I like, the tree is great, the happy hour is better, and the quality is all solid. &#160;I'd say my preferred spot in Ballard, about the same as Shiku, just a matter of what you like the place to look like! Upon walking in, this place had a great layout: 1/2 the middle was the sushi bar, the other 1/2 the classy bar, seating all around and an upstairs. Since this was a Sunday it was easy to get a table. Our server was Kim, and he was great. I asked for a non-alcoholic drink, and he made a ginger infused simple sugar lemonade and freshly squuezed OJ for me, which was incredible! It took massive willpower to not order another with vodka.My wife had the sashimi plate, which she was quite the fan of. I also had the ballard roll and tako nigiri, both definitely recommended. As for the downsides, a second server who's name I did not catch served the sashimi plate and nearly touched the food numerous times while pointing out the names of the fish, sadly nowhere near the grace of Kim. Also, I ordered an Unagi pressed roll, which I cannot recommend. It was sliced far too thin, and the roll was double high with egg in the middle, and had far too much drizzle of a teriyaki based glaze. Half the rice, double the unagi, lose the drizzle, and you're golden.I would go back for sure--Kim and the ballard roll made me want to return. I came here a few nights ago and was disappointed by the food. We ordered some nigiri and two rolls, and something was just off about everything we ate. I think the rice was overcooked or something, because it was really mushy. Maybe it was a bad batch? This was my first time there, so I can't really say.We went during normal dinner hours (not happy hour), and the food was pretty expensive. For the price, I would rather go to one of the many other great sushi restaurants in the area. The fish was just okay, but the rolls were pretty disappointing. I definitely wouldn't come back and pay full price for the food. The tree in the middle of the restaurant was pretty cool though... I preface this review with the fact that I am not a sashimi consumer and go for the "cooked" kind. &#160;With that said, I enjoyed:Edamame- salted boiled soybeans w/fine sea salt;Tori kara-age- gingery big chunks of fried dark chicken meat;Spider roll- soft shell crab, cucumber, mayo, lettuce &amp; tobiko;Sophi-san roll- shrimp tempura, cucumber, &amp; avocado topped with seared spicy snow crab;Ume shiso-cucumber, pickled plum &amp; shiso leaf;Kasu-zuke combo- grilled alaskan black cod marinated in sake curd &amp; white miso, rice, sunomono of hijiki &amp; cucumber, ume flavored takuan, miso soup;Amaebe head- left the shrimp nigiri to the friends. &#160;Yes, I do find crispy fried shrimp heads w/roe to be a treat.Shared the above with Calvin Y. as part of his celebratory b-day supper. &#160;Service was spot on and the asethetically pleasing decor kept my eyes occupied. &#160;As one of our friends noted, it is a spacious place for a sushi restaurant. &#160;I now want my own LED sakura tree. Meh. Sushi was only OK, and it felt more like a club than a restaurant. Sushi was OK, rolls were horribly overpriced &amp; service was pleasant, but really slow. Waited 15 min. for our cocktails, much longer for our food. The cherry blossom tree was really cool, but I'll go elsewhere for sushi next time. Definitely one of the top sushi restaurants in Seattle. The decor is fanciful and fun, and the food is decidedly yummy. We usually go for happy hour when you can get great prices on somewhat standard fare, but it's always good. The cocktails are especially creative and delicious. Great sushi. The green goddess roll is the best vegetarian roll I've ever had. Generally pretty decent service, but I've had times sitting upstairs where they took half an hour to bring me a roll and two nigiri. And I could see people below that came in and ordered after me getting sushi ahead of me. That was kind of lame. But all in all a great place to eat. We went here for the first time last night and used a http://Restaurant.com gift certificate. &#160;Amazing food, amazing service, amazing ambiance! Everything was incredible and very affordable for sushi that is clearly very high quality. &#160;We will definitely be back! Dropped in here for happy hour this week and really enjoyed it. &#160;We have had it on our list to try for awhile, so it was good to finally make it in. &#160;Their happy hour prices are pretty standard for a sushi place, but their ambiance is top notch. &#160;As mentioned my many other reviewers, the LED cherry tree really is quite cool!We had a couple edamame (LOTS of it), miso soup, a few rolls, and shared a sake and everything was very tasty and fresh. &#160;The service was also very good.Moshi Moshi is a very cool, hip place that I'm sure we will return to in the future when we crave sushi next! Moshi Moshi was our groups Saturday night dinner destination. I don't know how I have gone on so long without ever having this "oshizushi (pressed sushi)" but it was my absolute favorite. Its like sushi but without the seaweed - what a novel idea. We tried the tuna tataki with albacore and ginger. Another sushi roll favorite was the spicy scallop. The Asahi (large) was incredibly overpriced at $9. THAT IS INSANE. The markup was high but luckily the only real disappointment. Right in the heart of Ballard is this really cute restaurant - with a cherry blossom tree lit up in the middle of the restaurant. &#160;Very cozy seating downstairs - awesome view of the tree from the seating upstairs.Sushi is very good, black cod is awesome, and they even got cute little mochi ice cream. &#160;We had the pressed sushi there - and really, sushi rice is already pretty well compacted, so this extra pressed sushi... not so much (pretty to look at though). &#160;They have this famous cocktail (actually they are known for their cocktails) called the Angel's Share, which is no longer on the menu because it was so popular. &#160;You can still order it though.Really cute place to take your sweetheart. Big fan of Moshi Moshi, good quality, prices good, service good I was excited to eat here after walking by many times and seeing the restaurant vibrant and full. &#160;The design and atmosphere is really nice. &#160;But the food disappoints, both in terms of quality and price.This is an expensive sushi restaurant, with rolls costing as much as $15. &#160;We started with Miso Soup, which was the best part of our meal. &#160;The shrimp sunomono salad was hardly edible. &#160;The rolls lacked fish - the most annoying problem when you go out for raw fish, even more so when prices are higher than top-tier sushi restaurants like Umi Sake House and Nishino. &#160;We ordered four rolls, including the $15 Moshi Moshi house roll, which was supposed to be king crab topped with scallops. &#160;What we got was a small roll consisting of imitation crab, a huge piece of cucumber that overpowered any fish, and the thinnest possible layer of scallop over the top. &#160;In contrast, we also ordered a cucumber roll for $3, which was almost the same size and tasted the same. &#160;The seaweed was too dry, as was the rice, but the biggest problem was lack of fish.Our bill came out to $75 for two people (including tip, no beverages). &#160;All we really ate was miso soup, rice and cucumber. &#160;And we didn't leave full. &#160;For this amount, we could have eaten really well with alcohol at some of Seattle's best restaurants.Service was also disappointing, especially for this price category. &#160;While our server was nice, our soy sauce container was empty. &#160;After waiting a few minutes, we stole one from the table next door - also empty. &#160;After waiting a few more minutes, we stole one from two tables over which was finally full. &#160;Despite lots of staff, no one saw that we couldn't eat the sushi they hurriedly served us. &#160;The hostess also acted inconvenienced by our entering the restaurant, not a good first impression. SO GOOD.SO EXPENSIVE.SO WORTH IT.Came here late-ish on a Saturday night without reservations, only had to wait about a half hour for a table (and in this part of Ballard, there are plenty of things to do to kill a half hour, like have a quick drink at Hattie's Hat) for a party of three. Luckily, we had a groupon, so our wallets weren't terribly gouged. We started out with a glass of cava and a Violet Femme (cucumber vodka, creme de violet, lime, egg white). The cava was quite good, but the mixed drink was weak and didn't even fill the small glass. The flavor was overwhelmingly cucumber. If I'm paying $10 for a drink, I expect it to be tasty and strong, and it was neither. I recommend you stick with wine or sake.Our order consisted of a spicy tuna roll (not my fault), a Mad-I-San roll, a ginger-san roll and some hamachi. The spicy tuna and the ginger-san were both good, but not exceptional. The Mad-I-San (at the price tag of $14, ouch!) was absolutely delicious. The flavors all came together incredibly well, and normally I'd be allergic to paying that much for a roll, but it was wonderful. The standout, however, was the hamachi - cold, tender, melt-in-your-mouth delicious, with a delicate flavor that was the pinnacle of yellowtail goodness. The presentation was lovely as well. The decor is beautiful (light-up cherry blossom tree, anyone?) and the service was prompt and courteous, although our server felt the need to circle and star our original total on every single receipt when it came to tip time - rather tacky. We know how tipping works, even with groupons, thank you. Overall, it was probably a three-star experience, but I'm giving it four because the hamachi was just. that. good. Purdy cherry blossoms but such an Americanized sushi restaurant! We came by for dinner the other night and ordered the agedashi tofu (4 pieces for $5.50), beef kushi sashi (2 flat iron beef skewers with sansho pepper for $6.50). Quick description here...the skewers were about 6'' long and the beef looks really overcooked. Taste-wise, it's pretty good if you pretend that it's beef jerky. The sushi assortment ($17) included 6 pieces of nigiri, 6 pieces of tuna rolls ("tekka roll") and a bowl of miso soup. The fish were thinly sliced and didn't taste as fresh as other restaurants. The sophie-san roll ($12) had tempura shrimp inside and was topped with "spicy red crab". It was slightly spicy but I think they used canned crabmeat. It really wasn't that impressive. I love this place, the servers are fabulous, the bartenders are even better. They make you feel at home, while their restaurant was very crowded they still made us feel welcome and attempted to find us a seat. The sushi is amazing, the presentation is great too. I love the assortment of rolls. They even have a happy hour and multiple ones at that. The decor is beautiful, I have been here on multiple occasions and never once been disappointed. This is not your average Sushi bar, this is a gourmet sushi restaurant so do not expect $5 rolls Do yourself a favor and call ahead though it is popular and packed Where should I start with this place...I absolutely LOVE walking in to see the huge cherry blossom tree in the middle of the restaurant. &#160;It's so beautiful! &#160;It reminds me so much of my year abroad in Japan so many years ago! &#160;The decor of the place is very much like Japanese culture: simple, yet stunning! &#160;The food is aaaamazing! &#160;They make THE best spider roll outside of Osaka, Japan (no lie!) and the poke is so fresh the fish melts in your mouth! &#160;The red hot roll is another favorite of mine and the BF's. &#160;It's spicy, so if you can't take the heat... don't even &#160;bother! &#160;But we LOOOOVE heat, so we will sometimes order two, so we don't have to share. &#160;The assortment of rolls is great! &#160;I can't say I've ever been disappointed with anything I've ever tried. &#160;The sushi chefs are extremely talented, and they will prove it to you...If you're lucky enough to sit at the sushi bar, be prepared for one hell of a show! &#160;It will leave you wishing you, too, had a kitchen sword and could roll out such beautiful looking sushi! Their specialty cocktails are pretty good. &#160;I love sake, so I usually just order sake flights.Most of the time I come here for dinner and sit in the restaurant, which is great! &#160;Last week, I was here for HH with a gf. &#160;We decided to sit in the bar area. &#160;While the HH menu is great, the service in the bar area can be a bit slow... the bartender is, not only the bartender for the ENTIRE place, but he's also the server for the bar area. &#160;So, be prepared to wait a while between ordering drinks, then getting drinks, ordering food, getting food, getting your check, blah blah blah! &#160;Maybe it was just that day... we didn't really mind, since the two of us had A LOT of catching up to do. &#160;For the two of us, large hot sake (shared), edamame &amp; 4 different rolls came out to be $26... GYEAH! Went on a Saturday night. &#160;Even though we confirmed a reservation not for the bar, the reservations were still for the bar. &#160;But luckily, they were able to sit us at the sushi bar (even though the entire balcony was empty).The sushi chefs were nice once they found out my wife spoke Japanese. &#160;I had the Sushi Assortment and my wife had the chirashi. &#160;Both were really good. &#160;The chef even substituted in aji for me after we realized they had it in the case (rarity in Seattle). &#160;The chirashi was topped w/thick cuts of sashimi.We also ordered the Moshi-Moshi roll. &#160;It the delicious! &#160;The onion-shiso-lemon combination w/the scallops was perfect.I judge a sushi place by their sushi rice. &#160;These guys got it down...perfect texture and flavor. &#160;Their rice-to-fish ratio for their nigiri was right on.The only real misstep was the server. &#160;I think she came around 20 minutes after we sat down. &#160;Maybe she saw us ordering from the sushi chefs, but if she came by after we were seated, I would have ordered a beer. I had heard mixed reviews about Moshi Moshi - particularly around their sushi not being the best - but was drawn in by the amazing LED cherry tree like a moth to a flame....We sat at the bar and it was an great experience. &#160;The specials on the drink list are amazing, with good pours and unique flavors. &#160;Service was all we could ask for, and fast on a busy Friday night. &#160;The sushi rolls were great, but we also got a black cod cooked in sake dish that may be the best fish I have ever had. &#160;It melted in my mouth, with amazing flavor. &#160;I Just upped my rating from 4 to 5 stars. I really like Moshi Moshi. Their edamame is very nice with lots of sea salt and perfect steaminess. The rolls are creative and yummy, but they tend to be on the small size. Inventive menu and awesome atmosphere. The service is great and everyone is super friendly. The Redhot Roll and the Crunch Roll were definitely my favorites.I will be back :) The first time I walked by, this place reminded me of some place you'd find on the Lower Eastside of Manhattan. Simple, quaint, two-tiered restaurant with a focal point: that giant cherry blossom tree lit up like a firework smack-dab in the middle of the space. Without a doubt, people come here for the ambiance - but then the food isn't all that bad either.We came for the 4:30-6:00pm happy hour and ordered practically everything on it + a Chirashi bowl. Portions for everything were small but delicious. Prices were fair and not through the roof. Pretty similar pricing for any sushi joint in town. Free green tea.Also worth mentioning was the excellent service. Our waitress was very patient and chill with us. She wasn't too in-your-face, but at the same time, she came whenever we needed her and gave us good commentary on anything we asked about. We sat the sushi bar, and the sushi chef (probably the only Japanese guy who works here) was very hospitable and attentive to our every question and need.I would definitely come back here for another dinner or late night happy hour. I would even consider reserving the second level for some type of party event. Food was good, ambiance is amazing, and service was top-notch. Bravo, Moshi Moshi! Terrific - great service, great drinks, great conversation.Erik Carlson is impressive. &#160;Drinks were incredible, original, and revealing. &#160;We gave him little direction (make us something wonderful - nothing sweet), and he came back with drinks that we will forever call favorites. &#160;As he walked us through each pour, dash, and shake, it became clear that Erik is a master concotionist. &#160;These were Carlson originals, unique and delicious. &#160;The thirsty population of Ballard is lucky to have him.Thanks Moshi Moshi, and thanks Erik. I live within walking distance of moshi moshi and the food is generally really good. They offer a lot of creative and delicious vegetarian options which can be hard to find in a lot of sushi restaurants.The only gripe I've ever had with this place is that a couple of their servers are less than stellar. &#160;The service is usually fast and they bring food out as it's made which is great but twice now I've had somewhat rude service. &#160;Last time our waitress seemed annoyed to even be helping us and then I saw her publicly berating another employee which was just weird and uncomfortable. &#160;The time before last there was a mistake with my order and when I finally flagged down our waiter to send it back he acted pretty put out to have to have the order re-made even though he acknowledged the mistake. The first time that I went to Moshi Moshi, it was later at night. &#160;So when I walked in the door, the giant magnificent LED Cherry Blossom Tree, was quite an amazing spectacle to be greeted by. &#160;Everyone there is kind and friendly, from the moment we walked in, we were made to feel comfortable, and well taken care of. &#160;Sitting at the bar, we got to see Eric make all his signature cocktails up close. &#160;Using incredible liquors and liqueurs along with freshly squeezed juices, we thoroughly enjoyed each cocktail we ordered.I have been back a couple of times, and everything was as exceptional as expected. &#160;I will definitely continue to frequent this business, as should you. I love the decor of the bright cherry blossom tree. This would be one of the main reasons for my return. &#160;A little on the pricey side. But great cocktails and fresh fish. YUMMM!I also noticed that the slices of hamachi sashimi were very generous. I wish they had more options for rolls. The service wasn't bad either. &#160;All in all if you're in the area check it out! It was ok...For two people, we spent $55 and got 12 pieces of sashimi, a green tea, and a bottle of house sake. It seemed pretty expensive, if you ask me.The squid sashimi was okay. Well presented, but it didn't taste very fresh.The octopus sashimi was awesome, because you have to be retareded to mess up octopus. It's born perfect.The yellowtail sashimi was so fresh my hunny was blown away. It was PERFECT. It's rare to get yellowtail so fresh that it tastes this good. This is the reason I order yellowtail. In the hopes that this comes out. BRAVO for this, Moshi Moshi.But boo on your squid. And your prices. #1 tip: Make a reservation. &#160;This place packs up quickly and when I called to make a reservation the day-of, the only times available were after 8:45pm. &#160;Smart to think ahead!My favorite thing about Moshi Moshi is the lit-up tree in the middle of the bar. It's so distracting, but so awesome! &#160;Their menu is nothing too special in comparison to other sushi places that I've been to. &#160;We also ordered drinks and one cocktail literally took 15+ minutes to get. &#160;For two people, our bill was $70, which is pretty expensive for sushi (in my opinion), but the experience was a great one. &#160;Last, save room for their Tempura fried ice cream---so bomb!!! uh oh. . I like Shiku, but I think I like Moshi Moshi better! I LOVE the goddess roll and the seaweed sald kicks Shiku's ass. I'm vegan and they had quite a vew things on the menu I could eat. The only bad thing, the night we ate there we were a party of 6. They would only seat us at the sushi bar and we couldn't really talk to each other. I'm not sure why they were unable to put two tables together. So it's probablly not ideal if you have more than 4 people. Yummy! But one small flaw. The drinks were great - inventive and a little abnormal (one had egg whites). &#160;I had a tangerine type margarita - delicious! the sushi was gennerally very good. &#160;The green goddess was oh so yummy! Until - I bit into the tuna roll - which had a lot (nose burning level) of wasabi! I would go back for sure - but I would be careful of the wasabi level! Wow what a great little Sushi joint hidden in Ballard!Love the decor, the sushi chefs are friendly, have amazing vision and get it done!Geisha roll, spider roll, and an assortment of shrimp and salmon rolls... I don't even remember them all, too much sake! &#160;Full of flavor and fresh!
At first I didn't pick up on the name, I think mentally I subtracted the "d" and was thinking Panasia: another generic asian fusion restaurant, I presumed. It was only the picture of the panda on the menu that made me do a double take, then groan when I processed the semi-pun.Anyways, this is pretty much your standard chinese place and I was grabbing a quick lunch before a meeting. The lunch specials are in the $6-7 range and include an entree, egg roll, soup and rice. Plus tea. I ordered the cashew chicken as the entree which was reasonable: decent sized although a bit flavorless. I should note that on the menu they say that the dish is better when ordered spicy; consider me warned &#160;after going with the no spice. The hot and sour soup and egg roll were nicely done.A few points: there's a small area for parking in the back and the booths are all seated near the front windows which has a view of the adjacent street. There's also some sweet counter seating that looks in on the kitchen. I know some other reviews have panned the idea of looking in on the kitchen, but I found it refreshing. Plus it was nice to have them take my order, then hear the sizzle of the pan begin 60 seconds later. It just lets me know that they're on the ball here with speed of service. Total time from when I ordered-to served-to getting the receipt of the check: 24 minutes. Now that's a quick business lunch. This place deserves zero stars. To start with, the service over the phone and in person is terrible. Also, the food takes too long when you order delivery even when we live 1/2 mile away (usually that doesn't bother me when the food is worth the wait, but this just adds insult to injury). Also, the food is too expensive for what you get. Another thing that bothers us is that they do not know how to accommodate young children and it feels like they are offended when you eat there. Seattle is a place where you can find good Chinese food, you do not have to settle for this place.We won't be going back there again. Five of us had dinner family-style and we were impressed by the quantity of our entrees. I don't think even a truck driver could successfully tackle these plates of food, let alone one. We were served hot tea with our meals which helped offset the chilly dining area.We were one of two tables in the restaurant, but we also came to eat one hour before closing. I guess there's no reason to stay open late on a Saturday when everyone else is closed at 10:00pm.I'm not a fan of "Chinese" food (bastard American inventions) but our meals were tasty! I recommend the salt &amp; pepper tofu and vegetable lo mein, but be careful with the former as it's spicy.I'm guessing the amount of oil used in our meals didn't agree with my stomach the next morning. I took home leftovers and ate them cold for lunch, and so far I feel fine. My advice to everyone is order meals for take-out, stick the containers in your refrigerator, and then enjoy. the Service is pretty bad, even when they arent that busy. BUT their hot and sour soup is my favorite.. perfectly spicy, full of tofu and elephant ear mushrooms etc. The General Tso's chicken is also GREAT! but beware some days the breading is way to thick, when its right its really right though. &#160;Stay away from the noodle dishes (so greasy its gross)and anything with shrimp. You will thank me! &#160; stick to the chicken/rice dishes the soup and apps pls. What's with all these people with about three reviews hating on Pandasia?It's really not THAT bad! It's actually decent, and inexpensive to boot. As James said, 5 of us ordered 5 vegetarian dishes and it was WAY too much food. Maybe 4 dishes for 5 people would have been better. For me, the Salt &amp; Pepper Tofu and the Chinese Braised Eggplant with Mushrooms were the tastiest. The dining room might make Martha Stewart cry, but it's not the scruffiest cheap Chinese restaurant around. Maybe I was just hungry, but I thought it was a solid 3*s for what it is. Great service overall.. we got the dinner plates which come with appetizer, beans, soup and 3 entrees. &#160;We had enough food to be completely full and took about 5lbs of food home!The atmosphere is fair and the location is a bit odd.. but I have never seen the place packed and the service is very attentive. hurrah!i've only eaten here a few times, but i found my favorite thing the first time i was here and i just keep getting it over and over.... BLACK TEA SMOKED DUCK. it's half a freaking duck for about 15 bucks with tax that feeds me and my boyfriend for dinner. can't really beat that, right? it's bit salty (and this is from a serious salt lover and user) but i don't give a damn cuz it's so so so gooooooooood. close to my house, they deliver, they do take out, it's just plain awesome when i don't wanna cook. it's total hole, and the service is awful and a little slow, but hey... it's not always easy to get a duck fix for take out, and i'll to worse things to satisfy that craving. I discovered when ordering delivery from them they keep your credit card number on file without asking permission and also print it on the receipt that is stapled to your order. &#160;Shortly after I ordered from them my credit card number was used for several fraudulent purchases. Salt and pepper squid and vegitarian potstickers, it's all I need to say in regards to why i keep coming back. I stick to what I know so I am not disappointed, the waiter (since I always seem to get the same one) &#160;isn't very people friendly but does his job. &#160;It's okay, overall. We only get food delivered from this place. We only get said food delivered from this place if we are incapable of transporting ourselves to a better establishment (ie to instantly gratify that hankering for Broccoli Beef after a night of partying). They deliver pretty late, and the delivery is free. I will admit, this place has gotten better since the new owners have taken over, but there are better options right around the corner.
I remember this chain from my Berkeley days, with things not having changed much from what I recall: average broth, mediocre meat, and decent noodles and serving size for a fair price. Nothing to write home about though, especially with what I imagine are better pho places nearby. Service is relatively quick, so it also makes for an okay lunch stop if you're in a hurry.Unfortunately, for those sensitive to MSG, they're pretty heavy handed with it, as I was really feeling it by the time I got back to my office - I usually only get drowsy, but when I also get jittery I know a restaurant's overdone it. Will I go back? Possibly, but it's very very low on my list. I think their Pho is decent. Not really good, not bad either. Service is ok. Restroom is tolerable (I mean for a China Town standards). The place is somewhat clean.We might come back again but usually when we are at China Town, we prefer to have a Chinese cuisine instead. I think all PHO HOA's get about this rating.. I definitely wouldn't come here if I knew of another pho place in the area, but when there's a dearth in pho restaurants, it's convenient and it does hit the spot. One thing I love about this WA location is that the soup is nice and piping hot. WOOT. I guess WA knows a bit more about staying warm in the cold than CA does. Go figure. Another plus for serving the food so darn fast... I can't help it if I'm constantly hungry.
I love the location with the exposed brick walls and the dim lighting. But the food is so awful. So very, very awful. I ended up here because another friend had picked it for a group of 10 people on a Friday night. Luigi said we could order off the menu if we really wanted to but suggested they just throw something together for us based on what we liked and didn't like and that it would be a better deal and he'd throw in dessert. He asked us how much we wanted to spend total, including dessert and we settled on $25 a person.3 awful courses later the bill arrived and it worked out to $50 a person. Yes, that included some house red (which was acidic and off) but still. Double what we had agreed upon? I honestly wouldn't be complaining if any of the food had been decent but it wasn't. The main course Luigi selected for us was by far the worse. I couldn't even identify what it was exactly. Some sort of abused chicken covered in thick sauce with an unappetizing texture.I didn't bother to complain about the excess cost of the meal or the poor quality of the food since I was with a friend who had picked the place and seemed to enjoy it. But I'll definately never go back there. Run away.Response to Luigi: No one came over to ask if everything was okay once the main course arrived. Had that happened, I would have asked what exactly the main course was and pointed out that it seemed semi-raw and definitely inedible. But you're right that I didn't go out of my way to complain which I see as pointless.If someone serves you a bunch of food that you deem as awful, do you bother to tell them that or just leave and never go back? Since you're not the boss of me, I'm going with never going back. Good thing you're not the boss of me too, otherwise I'd be hungry and or have a stomach ache all the time.Tourist and other poor souls considering going here. May I suggest these places instead...Tavolata in Belltown (Yay Ethan Stowell!), Via Tribunali, Tutta Bella, or Dick's Drive In.UPDATE: Luigi just private messaged me..."Sorry but all waiters check back. "the boss of you" ...really how old are you. We would have refunded your money,but because you xhose the cowards way ,you're right please don't bother to return Ethan can have you" Way to win me over with your sparkling personality, fantastic grammar, accusations of lying and the threat of only being able to eat amazing food cooked by Ethan Stowell from this day forward. Oh noes! Whatever will I do? (I mean, besides tell all my pals on Twitter about how much you suck.) I took this so called "class" with a group of family members (bought a deal off the Strangermart) and well it wasn't really a class as much as a cooking demonstration (i.e. a guy who cooks in front of you but it is NOT a cooking class). I did not leave with recipes. It is not hands on at all.So if you want to go and have someone cook in front of you and talk a bit and laugh and drink with friends then this "class" works.If you want to go and actually do some hands on, leave with recipes to remake at home then this is not for you. (note this is also a restaurant so you do not have to take the class)As for the food:The food was ok. &#160;I liked some of it and could have done without on some of the other courses. &#160;They used balsamic vinegar in every course and it was not very high quality in that it was quite bitter/acidic. &#160;My sweetie hates balsamic and I had to show him what good balsamic tastes like in comparison to what he had at the "class" and he was amazed at the difference. &#160;He noted he liked mine but what was served at the restaurant not so much.They really liked to push the alcohol on each course. &#160;I know that is where they make their money but seriously...every course...and boy it added up so be prepared for that.Just Sayin.PS...the guy who cooks is a smoker and he was smoking outside of the restaurant and then outside of the backdoor and it drifted into the area we were in while we were waiting. &#160;YUCK. &#160;not so appitizing when you are eating.Also his cleanliness of hands was not so good in that he would cough and not wash his hands after wards...ewwww.Look at your bill carefully as they screwed up our bill a bit and did not utilized the 50% off of the class coupon I had and we had to talk to several people before getting it right.**Please note this is also a restaurant so you do not have to take the class. &#160; You could just go in for lunch or dinner. &#160;But after my experience with the cooking class. &#160;I will pass.Also...I was the organizer and yet the owner/teacher kept going back to the male in our group in regards to bill, questions etc. &#160;Ummm I organized thus you should have been chatting with me... Went to a "cooking class" here with a group of friends, and was disappointed in that it wasn't so much a cooking CLASS, as opposed to watching the owner cook meals for us.The dishes were okay, some were spot on, and others not so much so (especially given that he used a low grade basalmic vinegar which was acidic and bitter).Also there was quite a bit of confusion over the promo we had from The Strangermart, they were reticent to adhere to the terms of the promo.I am sure the regular dining would be a better experience, however I was so unimpressed that I don't think I would give them the benefit of the doubt to find that out. I would have never known Seattle has a "Little Italy" - and little indeed - had it not been for Groupon. The deal was for a 3 course dinner cooking class for 2. I took a friend for her birthday. The restaurant was small an intimate - only a table or two was occupied when we arrived and the class had an entire room to ourselves. We thought we might be the only ones, until a loud group of ladies bursted in from the cold and were a constant source of entertainment and fun from the very start. Luigi himself taught the class, which was more of an informal dinner that he told us about the ingredients and how he was preparing it while having someone from the class assist for each course (I helped with the pork &#160;bit- awesome!). A great way to spend the evening - and the food was pretty excellent as well. I was a tad bit disappointed the pasta was dried and pre-purchased, (there really is nothing like fresh pasta) -and the dessert, although really good, was bananas flambe. I thought that was French? Or New Orleans? So I really didn't learn any epicurian treat, but had a great tuna salad, pasta, and evening overall.The one thing that was disappointing - the Groupon did specify that alcohol wasn't included - was the alcohol bill. When we arrived, we were offered options of drinks and we all opted for a cocktail to start (basically limoncello with a mixer served in a martini glass - a really nice shot :) ,then we all opted to share carafes of the house red wine (the limoncello was much smoother), and at the end, everyone had an after dinner drink. So at the end we received the bill for the dinner and drinks, with the prepaid Groupon deducted from the total. Which should have just been the drinks, right? When it was all said and done, the drinks came close to $80 (I think somewhere around $75) - which was a disappointment how it was presented, charged, and that fact that the Groupon was $35 - for 2 people for dinner!I recently saw that Groupon had a new offer for the 3 course dinner, this time a bottle of wine was included - for $40! Bummer - it was such a lovely evening but disappointing &#160;that it had to end on the note of 3-4 drinks each cost twice as much as dinner.That didn't change that the food and company were quite lovely - and Luigi certainly made it a special evening for us all... Underwhelmed. We were looking for a last minute place that could accommodate 12 people for dinner and was near where we were doing happy hour. My friend made a call and Al Boccalino could get us in. She had raved about the meals she had previously here so I was pretty excited. There was a cooking class being conducted in the main room but the place was otherwise pretty empty for a Friday night. Our server recommended ordering family style with a group our size so we provided her with some parameters and she took it from there. We started with the garlic bread (which was really good as people have stated), a Caesar and insalta mista. We ordered 4 bottles of wine to start...the first they brought out (a sangiovese) tasted like vinegar so we sent it back. They said they had a barbera for the same price so we opted to go with that...it didn't taste much better. There are so many amazing Italian wines out there and what they had on their menu was weak. I should be able to get a decent bottle for $30 but that wasn't the case here. We also had a vegetarian pasta (which was probably the best of the bunch) and a spaghetti with meat sauce (I believe it was a lamb ragu which I normally love). The last item was a chicken served over polenta which was ho-hum. &#160;Our total ended up coming to about $50/per person which wasn't bad with the wine and the food. &#160;I don't think I will be seeking out this small Italian restuarant in Pioneer Square again. PUKE!I knew we should have turned right around when we walked into this restaurant, which smelled like stale smoke. A woman walked in behind us, and since it was a weird time for lunch (3PM), we asked her if they were still serving lunch. She went to ask the chef and with his approval, she sat us down by the lovely window. One other group was eating and this woman, the chef and another person were sitting towards the back of the place.The chef explained that they have a $7 lunch and that today it was pasta, salad and bread. We agreed that it sounded good. Less than 3 minutes later he returned. We were served spaghetti in a tomato sauce with cut asparagus, a mesclun salad with horrible vinaigrette and a slice of toast. Mine was so burnt that I couldn't eat more than 1 bite. I can't believe he had the gall to serve that! By the way, it was room temperature!!! The spaghetti was edible, but the sauce was full of lots of dried parsley and tasted like horrible leftovers. The portion was very small...child portion small.DO NOT EAT HERE!The service was oddly nice. It made me wonder why someone who seems to care serves such horrible food. Also, the chef lit up a cigarette at the back of the restaurant while we were eating our meal. PUKE again! Ate lunch here once. My companions had OK food, but I had a Caesar's salad with tired, brown lettuce. Honestly, it looked like the kind of salad I used to make when I lived in college and had kept a head of lettuce in the fridge way too long but ate it anyway because I was too stupid to care and too poor to get another head of lettuce. In other words, the kind of food you eat only under pressure, or because you're just not in a mood to be bothered about sending it back. I don't mean just a little brown on the tips -- I mean really aged, really cruddy old lettuce. I was shocked.BTW, it has only been about 48 hours since I ate there, so if the brown lettuce is suddenly poisoning me this may be my last Yelp review ever!Maybe it was an off day, but I have plenty of choices and no reason to give it another try. This place must be hit or miss, because my bf and I had a fantastic time doing the cooking class. Granted it was more of a watch one or two people prepare a dish made of ingredients that have been prepared before the cooking class, but nonetheless, it was still fun to go up and stir the pot. Luigi was a very funny man in my opinion. I can see how he might rub you the wrong way. His jokes were a little risqu&#233;, but I found them hilarious! I gave 4 stars due to the value based on the experience and cost of the class and wine for two. Luckily, I had the Groupon deal (60% off the class for two, not including wine). If it were the cost of the Groupon deal by default, I would definitely go again. I took the cooking class and had an absolutely awesome time! &#160;They DID give out recipes and there was nothing "unclean" about any of the experience. &#160;Sometimes when I read other reviews I think that people must have gone to an entirely different place. &#160;If you enjoy a relaxed, fun evening, good food, meeting new people, versus a clinical cooking "school" this is a fun class to take and worth more than you paid for it. My husband and I went there last night for a cooking class with a Groupon and we had a really fun time. &#160;I'd read the reviews and I understand that it isn't a cooking class like I've taken at a school, but Luigi did teach, and we did learn, and we ate dinner and drank wine and chatted with strangers, and it was fun. &#160;That's what we paid for, a fun night out, not to become a chef. &#160;I learned how to make a tasty marinara and braise meat in a good sauce and serve poached pears in a delicious rum sauce, all while drinking a bottle of wine... nothing to complain about there. &#160;The place was small and there was a lot of people, and it felt like you and a dozen people who could be your friends were there to help your favorite uncle make his specialties. &#160;He presented the food as an expert, a few people helped make the dishes, nobody had to do any heavy lifting in the kitchen, and everyone laughed and cheered throughout the meal. &#160;I cook every night of my life, so if someone else wants to do the prep work and let me watch and lightly participate, I'm all for it, there wasn't anything going on that I couldn't remember and recreate using the good sense I was born with. It was a good deal, we were full and happy at the end, and we both left hoping that when we travel to Italy we'll find the same authentic joie de vivre there that we found in Luigi's dining room. My mom and I came in for a cooking class at Al Boccalino....Seattle's Little Italy. &#160;We got a great deal off of Groupon!The space was small but eclectic just as you would expect for Pioneer Square. I wasn't sure what to expect but it ended up being a fabulous evening shared with 8 awesome strangers and Luigi. Luigi, the owner, taught the class in his great thick Italian accent and was very entertaining and knowledgeable throughout the evening. &#160;I loved the hands on portions of the 4 course meal that everyone had a chance to participate in making. I felt like I was in his kitchen at his house learning how to cook a real Italian dinner. &#160;I am not one for following strict instructions in the kitchen so I definitely liked his approach to the class.I left with these thoughts.....1) The food was great! I especially like the Fluffy Ricotta and Frutta dessert...I could easily do it again!2) Great atmosphere, host, and people to share it with! (Maybe we got lucky with the others attending but they were great!)3) The house red wine was delicious and reasonably priced.4) This is not the place for those who like a strict step by step, spoon fed instruction type of cooking class or are who have extreme germaphobia! (I am glad I had neither in my group)! &#160;I would agree with the other comments in that a big bottle of Purel should be on the table so everyone is more comfortable! There are a lot of germ conscious people out there these days!I laughed a lot, learned a lot, and ate a lot!Thanks Luigi! Salud! Owner and cook Luigi is so nice. I craved traditional lasagna, they had it delivered from a sister restaurant nearby. Luigi came out to visit with his customers. Delicious! Quaint place, nice artwork. Not pretentious at all.Perfect neighborhood haunt.They have night cooking classes too. I couldn't agree with K.S. more. We also attended a Groupon cooking "class." The food was terrible and the ingredients cheap: pasta with TONS of pepper and a few cherry tomatoes. That was it. Pre-packaged chicken fingers cooked in olive oil with a few more cherry tomatoes. I also could and do make better at home. Luigi also overcharged us at the end, but we didn't speak up because we came as guests of our friends. Oh, and the wine, just swill. The whole place has the musty, quiet panic of a dying restaurant. Chef is, at the least, out of touch and perhaps somewhat delusional (an act that works for him. Huh, Luigi?). BEWARE of this charlatan, whom I assume makes most of his money from unsuspecting Pioneer Square tourists who are here today and gone tomorrow. &#160;He ripped us off previously at one of his other nearby places, Cafe Bengodi. He served us dry leftovers, brought out too much food and then way overcharged.Shame on you, sir. I have attended a cooking "class" and was very disappointed. As stated by other reviewers - there were no recipes handed out. Also, I walked in after class to use the restroom one more time before heading home, and I caught the owner, Luigi, smoking IN the dining room where he taught the "class." This is against the law in Seattle, I should have called the health department. &#160;He was also coughing and not covering his mouth while over the food, and he didn't wash his hands as much as one should when handling food. I know this because I have a valid food handler's permit, also.I expected a hand's on cooking class to be just that - somewhere where I am chopping, preparing, seasoning and then enjoying. This was more of someone cooks (and coughs all over the food) for you, rushes you through the courses, and then hands you the bill. Which, also, was incorrect. The amount of the coupon (from another site) was for 50% off the cost of the class, and I went in a group. What should have been the $300 we had already paid, was then charged to us again, and I sat there and argued with the owner over this. He didn't seem to grasp the coupon he wrote. &#160;I write contracts for a living, I read the fine print before we went to the class. &#160;He wouldn't talk to me, he would only talk to my brother-in-law. &#160;My BIL finally asked me to take care of it, because I knew what was up. &#160;Luigi had to deal with me instead. &#160;Buyer beware - and I hope you like someone coughing all over your food who will then try to over charge you at the end.I might have been a bit more lenient if he would have given recipes out, but even then, the food was rather bland and easy, heavy on the cheap balsamic vinegar, that any slightly experienced chef could have come up with those dishes. I have, in fact, and I must say, they were better.If I saw how he cooks in front of a group, I shudder ot think what goes on in the kitchen. We went to this 'cooking class' as a family gathering. It was advertised as a 'cooking class' so we were excited to learn and try something hands on. This class should be considered a cooking demonstration. The food was okay but balsamic (not great quality) was used in every dish. They also pushed the alcohol in every course. I understand that alcohol is where you make your money but every course there was a push. We did a promo through Strangermart and when we went redeem it they did not understand their promotion and wasn't honoring it correctly. We had to explain the coupon to them. It left us feeling negative about the experience and not wanting to come back. I took my girlfriend here on a date the other night. Italian food is not that hard to mess up. I could have cooked better food myself at age 8. I wish the food was good, but it truly was substandard. My chicken parm was dry and a little burnt, the pasta that came with it was half dry and bland, then half dry and mouth burning spicy. My girlfriend had spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were very dry. I will say the service was quite good, but the food was really bad. Cool place, so get your act together and oversee the cooking instead of spending so much time in the dining room Luigi!
Just dropped by Tony's to pick up a couple of banh mi for lunch, and having never been there before, I was pleasantly surprised by what I found. I ordered a pork meat ball and shredded chicken (both 2.50), which &#160;were promptly made and I was in and out in a matter of minutes; it was so quick in fact that I didn't have enough time to look at all the neat, delicious lookin stuff scattered around the joint. Next time...When I got home, I unwrapped my sandwiches, slathered sriracha on 'em and dug in. The shredded chicken was up first, and the crusty baguette let loose a shower a crumbs as I bit in. The chicken was well seasoned and worked well with the salad of cucumbers, carrots, onions, cilantro, jalapenos*** that came on top.I kept wishing i had a some nuoc cham in which dunk the crusty-ass bread in to soften up a bit, but I'm lame like that. I tore in to the pork next and again found the meat well seasoned and deliciouslly complex in the way that only a decent bahn mi can be.No issues with cleanliness that I saw, and the ladies behind the counter were very helpful. &#160;Would have given 4 starts, but my pork meat ball bahn mi was a little short on the meat side and the jalapenos*** on both sandwiches were both past their prime. Picky? Maybe. I've been here many times. &#160;I would give it 5 stars if the shop is a bit cleaner. &#160;Other than that, I love the variety of vietnamese sandwiches, spring rolls, lunch boxes, etc. &#160;They have great prices for great food... Great sandwiches and hot lunches for cheap. Also, try their avocado milkshake - it's the best I've had.
I dig this place. When I am too tired to cook after work (yes, opening a can of soup can be labor intensive on some days), I keep driving on Aurora until I get to The 5 Seasons Grill. The restaurant always sneaks up on me, but luckily it is BRIGHT green. Pretty hard to miss.I love their fresh rolls, pho, and bun. The service is also friendly and quick. I'm a fan! Good, straight forward food that's not fancy, but delicious. Reasonably priced. Get the grilled pork. Sometimes a bit inconsistent. Spacious, well-lit interior. Courteous, quick service. Ordered the steamed rice and barbecued chicken. Succulent. See ya Than Bros it was real! I'll admit I was skeptical about this place, but I'm a believer now.I've been eating Pho with my Viet fam since second grade, and I can honestly say this place has some of the best broth I've ever tasted outside of the OC,Vancouver BC etc. Fresh made, no powder mix, so it should be okay for gluten free needs. It was so good I actually forgot to throw in the bean sprouts,sweet basil etc. haha The staff was extremely friendly.I'm definitely going to come back and try some of their other dishes. The menu is huge.I could care less if they don't give out a cream puff. I can go buy a bucket of those at Costco meh. &#160;This place is well worth a try. Parking kind of sucks, but that does not bother me. I ordered wrong. &#160;My daughter and I went out for pho and I got distracted by the words "honey walnut prawns". &#160;So I ordered them and they were actually pretty icky. &#160;I think the prawns were frozen--like fish sticks. &#160;The sauce was good, but the breading was just like fish sticks. &#160;This place came highly recommended by my sister. &#160;She won't go anywhere else. &#160;And I tried my daughter's pho and it was good. &#160;The staff were super nice, the restaurant itself was a notch above most Vietnamese places, parking was easy. &#160;I'm going to have to give this place another chance.
Alright, so I might be a little biased since I had just walked out from the very disappointing visit to the sushi place next door, but the guy working was very nice and he indulged our urge to get a kids meal without giving us a weird look or a bad time. And the food tasted good and fresh. It's a Subway! It you want a good and cheap sandwich, you know where to go!
Bad service. &#160;High prices. &#160;Bad food. &#160;This place has it all.If you can figure out what they have on their menu, as they haven't figured out how to have a website or advertise that they deliver unless you go into the venue and pick up a menu, Other meals, besides pizza, featured on the menu look like they were produced by an inner city school lunch kitchen.This place should be best avoided for all practical purposes. The food's great, and the staff are niceit just smells bad when waiting in linebecause it fills up really easily.but garlic bread is to die for! Used to be one of the best pizza joints in Seattle. I have frequented this place since 2000, but since early 2007, service and quality both dropped to an intolerable level. Needless to say, I am looking for some good pizza replacements in Seattle, and it has been difficult. I find this whole thing very confusing, but I guess there are three Olympia Pizza Houses...or maybe more, according to Yelp. Anyway, I used to order the best grinders for takeout from Olympia Pizza House 3 on Capitol Hill (the pasta is just okay), but until last week I hadn't tried the Wallingford location. Apparently even though all these restaurants have the same name, they don't have the same menu. The Wallingford restaurant seems to lean a little heavier on the Greek than the Italian - or maybe that was just my perception. I wasn't really in the mood for a sandwich, so while my dining companion settled into a Chicken Parmigiana, I opted for the "Special" listed on the board: Grilled Lamb Souvlaki. And I am PLEASED that I did. My meal started with a generously portioned salad of cucumbers, green peppers, tomatoes, kalamata olives &amp; red onions with feta cheese and a bit of olive oil. Mmm-mmm. Then, they brought out two skewers of nicely seasoned, juicy lamb accompanied by sauted veggies (my choice over...fries???), and about 5 pieces of pita bread. I skipped the pita, but the lamb and veggies were perfect. So, while I don't trust any of the "Italian" food there outside of the sandwiches, if you end up at this place with a friend I'd suggest taking a look at the Greek Specials they have, and trying one. It might be the only way to get decent food at this restaurant. :) Maybe 3.5 would be ideal. Sister, nephew and I went on Saturday, pre-Trophy and pre-looking at Xmas lights. It was about 3:30, so the place was dead... which was OK, since I was tired, nephew was tired and crowds wouldn't make us get our food any sooner. There was one other table occupied and we got seated right next to them. GRR. Anyways, our server was chipper as could be, and we ordered tortellini for the munchkin and then a pizza for us to all share. It was actually really good. Good ingredients, good crust, etc. We had plenty of leftovers too. Our server took a while for us to get our check, but right when we finished is when the evening crowd began to filter in. Will I be back? sure. Not rushing though.
I really need to go back soon...this is probably my favorite bar in Fremont, but it's hard to lure me off of Capitol Hill these days. &#160;I find it hard NOT to have a great time here, even when my drinking was limited to diet coke for a while there. &#160;I personally love the pub food with a Newcastle, Boddingtons or Guinness--standouts include the fish n' chips, shephard's pie, bangers n' mash, and the steak sandwich. &#160;It's cozy and dark without being dingy, and though it gets crazy on weekend nights, somehow the staff still make it feel comfortable and welcoming.I love that they advertise "Football on Telly"- is that like "Hamster on Piano"? &#160;The year before last my soccer-loving friend Linda L. brought me here to help her cheer for Liverpool on a number of occasions, and I couldn't help but get into the spirit. &#160;How can you not with all that eye candy on the screen :) &#160;I hear they have a pretty hardcore trivia night, but I haven't yet checked that out. &#160;My trivia dream team would definitely include Adam C. I finally did it. &#160;I've been drinking for over ten years, and I finally got kicked out of a bar. &#160;That bar was The George &amp; Dragon in Fremont. &#160;I was having a cigarette on the patio, which is stupid in the first place, because I just quit smoking recently, and it's extra stupid because they have about seventeen "No Smoking" signs per square foot out there, AND the guy had apparently already asked me once to put it out, and...well, come to think of it, I guess I pretty much deserved to be booted out of there. &#160;I still think the bouncer was a little too much of a dick about it, though, especially since I was very apologetic. &#160;Anyway, I was liking the place up to that point. &#160;Dark wood, good bar service, good selection if you like UK beers. &#160;A little crowded for me. &#160;Nice patio, though.**UPDATE** &#160;I just remembered (hazily) that I barged into some people's conversation out on the patio uninvited. &#160;The evening is quite fuzzy at this point, but one of you was English and I think I may have tried to do an English accent for you. &#160;Man, I'm an idiot. &#160;My apologies. &#160;I'm sure that if I was funny, it was for all the wrong reasons. I love G&amp;D because they are serve many a Guinness (http://en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;) product as well as other beers from around the world, but especially around the UK (http://en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;).They have a ton of soccer/futbol/Association Football (http://en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;) games on their tellies.They certainly do not have any silly gastropub (http://en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;) food, but they do have pub grub (read: fried and/or heavy) (http://en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;).Just don't get this place confused with the Hungarian journalist/editor/musician (http://en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;). This place is the "Stargate' of bars!! &#160;You walk through the singularity of awesome and come out the other end quite amused indeed! &#160;Excellent place if your like me and enjoy having a conversation with like minded souls over several pints, assorted wines and bloody good whiskey.OR if you're not into that the bartenders are very nice and attentive, I'm sure you'll find a friend who ever you are. Went here last night and had a blast. It was easy to get a drink even though there were only 2 bartenders and it was pretty busy. Also.. the bartenders were female and I still was able to get a drink. That's pretty fantastic.-They have a good assortment of beers on tap... and those glasses were for surely larger than a pint glass. -The ladies room wasn't in bad condition.. which is a plus.Tip: Watch out for the stairs outside in front of the door.... if you're drunk and wearing stilettos. Minus one star for the decor having an Austin Powers theme. George &amp; Dragon is What White People Like. It's that girl who says she can do a British accent because she's seen My Fair Lady. It's that guy with a Manc United scarf over the back of his ergonomic chair. But sometimes you just need some fish and chips and a patio. This pub has those things.Also sometimes you don't want Thai food. Is there any better place? &#160;Magically transforms into the place you need it to be: &#160;place for watching soccer games with a few (dozen) of &#160;friends, place to be seen in evenings, and a place to just meet and chill with friends. (Out on the deck.)I Love this place. - Toby Keith(who won't be found in the jukebox. another plus.) I spent some quality time on the patio here on Saturday night. Aside from the fact that I Second-Hand-Smoked about 2 packs while sitting there, it was a good time. (Breathe deep, kids.) There were lots of cool young people to chit-chat with, and the vodka tonics were fab.Note to Self: Next time, try the shepherd's pie. Mmm...meat and potatoes... British breakfasts. &#160;If you have not experienced one of these, get down to the Fremont and order one posthaste. &#160;Two fried eggs, a banger (from Uli's), bacon, mushrooms, tomatoes, and baked beans for your toast. &#160;And thankfully they are proper beans too ("beanz meanz Heinz"), not the overly sweet American kind... Food is served from 11:30 until 22:00 with a full bar offering beer, wine, cider, spirits, and cocktails. &#160;They have other fare on their menu as a pub should - shepherd's pie, fish + chips, bangers and mash, baps, curries and other like burgers and salads. &#160;Why stray from the British breakfast? &#160;It is a plate full of perfection and enough food to fuel you for many hours. &#160;The parking lot is small but there's usually street parking within 2-3 blocks. &#160;Consider parking several blocks away so you can enjoy that fry-up with a clear conscience. &#160;There's an outside patio and they play televised football matches on the telly... English footie, not the American kind. This place has hands down, the highest concentration of Seattles hottest, "REAL" women. aging anywhere from 21-91. Go there anyday of the week, and if you don''t like what you see....wait 5 minutes.It has a mom &amp; pop kinda feel, so you might feel outta place at first but they will make you feel like family quickley. TIp well, &amp; it will be noticed. If your looking for the 3 hour relationship, then this place is a must. Try the weeknights for best results. Trivia night ropes in some nice talent. I recently had my 23rd birthday at The George and Dragon, and they were more than accomodating for my party of about 15 people. They were kind enough to reserve an entire section of the bar for us, although we had to get there by 9pm.It's safe to say the night began well, with us having a place to sit and all. I can't say the night ended well when I had 10 drinks in 2 hours. When I stumbled out of the bar around 12:30 (i know, i'm getting old) I can say I was drunk beyond belief and very happy with the way the night had gone.Thanks to John (owner?), who made my birthday possible and very fun! Watch a soccer game and have a pint?George and Dragon, where else?! G&amp;D is typically a pretty relaxed place with the exception of during the World Cup or the Fremont Fair. I personally go for the Shepherd's Pie, which gets dramatically better if you order a side of gravy to pour on top and extra booze to pour inside yourself. I WANT to love this place. &#160; I'm about the biggest English football fan in Seattle (especially Liverpool). &#160;But I don't love this place. &#160;It has a dark and unfriendly vibe. &#160; I've been here at -least- fifty times, have spent thousands of dollars here, &#160;and will continue to come for the broadcasts, but I still don't like it.The beer is a bit overpriced, the English beer is overchilled and not authentic (I go to England and get the real stuff all the time, and lived in England for a while). &#160; The food is actually BETTER than what you'd get in the typical English pub, but is really unhealthy crap (except for the caesar salad, perhaps), so I've stopped ordering food.The owners (the two Johns) are cold and unfriendly, and the staff are likewise, and the regulars are amazingly devoid of camaraderie. &#160;So much so, that I avoid the place unless my darling Reds are on the screen and I have not cheated and learned the result in advance (almost all football matches are shown on their Tivos, due to the eight-hour timezone difference... &#160; really major games are shown live at crazy early hours)Maybe it's me. &#160; But other places in Seattle are not like this at all.So go to their websitehttp://www.georgeanddrag&#8230;and check out who's on the screens, when, and go.But in general, blah. If you don't like soccer (football), then don't go to the George and Dragon when it is on TV (the telly). &#160;"But I don't know when they play it," is no excuse because all you have to do is go here: &#160;http://www.georgeanddrag&#8230;. &#160;Furthermore, it is a pretty safe bet that Friday and Saturday nights are for socializing with the Fremont bar crowd.I enjoy watching football on the telly at the George. &#160;If you want to watch American throwball, go to Fox Sports.If you want to drink shitty American beer (tasty local micros excluded), then go to Norms or the Ballroom. &#160;The George has a huge selection of beer, but you are best served (no pun intended), selecting from the wide variety of British and European beers. &#160;I like to rotate through them all while I'm watching football (soccer).I really like it at the George and Dragon, and the only reason that I'm knocking off a star is because my girlfriends get hit on by nasty, Fremont bar stars on those aforementioned &#160;Friday and Saturday nights. &#160;That's why we generally avoid the Ballroom, but I guess you can't really avoid it, can you? This is my favorite bar in all of Seattle. Hell, this might be my favorite bar of all time. No. Seriously. I mean it this time. Whats that? You've heard of my tendancy for superlatives and exaggeration and you dont believe me? Ha! I dare you to see for yourself. This place not only has Boddingtons and And AND BELHAVEN scottish pub ale on nitro draft, it also features footie, bangers and mash, kick ass fish and chips (hold the newspaper wrapper and the skin, thank you), and a Pirate. Thats right, folks, a Pirate. If youve had more than one pint there, or maybe more than one dozen pints there, you know what i mean. Awesome for a casual first date spot (any girl thats not into the G &amp; D just cant party with me), meeting old friends (a must if any of your friends in from out of town have old college study abroad British Pub drinking stories), or just drinking alone. The TVs go off at about 9 or 10 if no setanta Footie is on live that night, so sorry folks, if you MUST have that 5th round of Sportcenter for the evening, you will have to move down the street.Im serious. Its raining right now. G &amp; D serves coffee. And they WILL put booze in it. What more do you need? What? You need a covered heated patio to smoke while drinking your Irish coffee becuase it cold and raining? wow! so needy. GnD to the rescue yet again. God I love this place. This is one of my favorite bars in Seattle. Whenever we plan a big night out, inevitably we end up at the George. Great atmosphere for football (soccer), and every time I've gone with my buddies for Liverpool F.C. games it's been packed wall-to-wall. Even for early morning kickoffs where most of us are still hungover and looking forward to the fantastic full-English breakfasts. The fish and chips and the gyro are also outstanding. One reason why I'm not a huge fan of bars in Fremont is the frat-tastic scene on weekends. The George is largely devoid of that, thank God. Great place to people watch, soak in the atmosphere of a Liverpool-Everton derby and drink some English beers. A pub pure a simple. And a good one at that. Go for the footy on the weekends and for a good morning ale ( I mean whats better than a boddingtons at 10am?) . The real trick is navigating the die-hards. The place can get raucous and if you fall on the wrong side of a dubious goal, you may have to defend your dignity.Haven't really tried the food, so can't say much there. The place can get a bit crowded for big games so go early and while the outdoor seating is nice when its warm, the cold will make the inside even cozier. Other than that though, just a solid place to watch a game. I've been here just once but I had a really pleasant experience. When the weather permits, the bar almost doubles in size because patrons can enjoy the outdoor patio. There are pool tables, TV airing soccer games from around the globe and of course - great drinks! I'm usually stuck in Capitol Hill where I live because I don't have to pay for a cab or drive but I do think I owe this place a visit because it was a good time had by all when I was there. Trivia nights are great too! The only reason l give this place four stars (especially when l've been frequenting it for several years now) instead of five, is because of how small it is. &#160;lt just needs to be bigger because it's that cool a bar. &#160;But l want people to know that the no-smoking on deck (which is very recent) is the result of some very nasty non-smokers taking them to court over the 25-foot rule, and making their lives miserable. &#160;lf the staff are rude about it, it's because they're shelling out a LOT of money in fines. &#160;This is hard on the regulars who are used to smoking out there and accidentally light up when they've been drinking. &#160;But please understand that there's a reason for it, because the people who took them to court keep coming back and making a big deal. &#160;So far, it seems these people don't actually frequent the place, they're just looking to raise hell. &#160;On with my review.l lived in a few countries influenced by British culture, and l love me some Shepherd's Pie and Bangers and Mash. &#160;Both are excellent. &#160;Get a little grilled sandwich, which is moderately priced, and those are great too. &#160;lf the beer seems expensive, it's because they're giving you more. &#160;As in, quantity. &#160;Larger glasses, more beer. &#160;Don't tip worse because of this; tip better. &#160;They want you to enjoy yourselves.lf you're a soccer fan, this is the place for you. &#160;Keep in mind that the place is small, so if you like pool and darts, these are going to be challenging. &#160;But you will always catch your games, and 60% of the staff (if not more) has been there for years, and are both friendly and prompt. &#160;As l said, it can be crowded, so if it takes a while to get your drink, it's not for lack of service.And in the summers, despite the new smoking rules, the decks are perfect. &#160;And if you're not into older British men starting conversations with you (though not always hitting on you), maybe this isn't the place for you. &#160;lt's a British pub, where British-American citizens come to get a taste of home. &#160;Clearly, they find it here. &#160;And so do many others who appreciate them.Edited to add that in over four years of frequenting this place, as another points out, the frat quotient is low, and l've yet to see a fight break out there. &#160;l'm adding my fifth star for that. It's one thing to go to an "Irish" or "English" pub - it's a whole other experience when the owner of said pub is actually from the old country and the pub is a haven for ex-pats.If you're a soccer fan and want to hang out with other like-minded folk - whether it be MLS or EPL or any other league, you will love this place. Go SOUNDERS! LOVE IT. Top notch atmosphere, wide selection of beers, stiff drinks and delicious food. I am usually not a big fan of British food, but their English Breakfast is to die for. Get it, and thank God for giving you this opportunity to eat yourself retarded with delicious food.However, the wait time for everything is TOO long and it takes forever to get your food. I'm still giving it 5 stars just because it's delicious but beware that you have to order your food an hour in advance and make sure you order two drinks at a time so you don't have to waste your time in line.Cheers. Great beer selection and good staff behind the bar, but this place is to be avoided on football/soccer broadcast nights.We've never eaten here and probably never will. Drinking on the patio in the summer is tops. Stepping into the G&amp;D I honestly felt like I was back across the pond. &#160;Super low-light atmosphere, it took me a good five minutes to get adjusted and find my friends at a back table. &#160;Great beers on tap, including cider. &#160;The bartenders were friendly without being all up in our business. &#160;We ordered the fish and chips and while the chips/fries were less than stellar, the great fish made up for them.I'm definitely coming back to see what its like during a Premiership or Champions League game. &#160;It wasn't too crowded for the rugby match, but people were definitely paying attention.All in all a great pocket of English culture in Fremont! Considered on the fringe of the Fremont night scene, this little British Pub maintains its ground quite well. Dark and drab in appearance, the gloomy wood furniture sends the message to patrons "Don't worry about spilling, happens all the time". I'm not sure how authentic of a British Pub this place is. After all, I saw no one appearing remotely of British roots (pale, bad teeth, popped collars) but instead found a strong showing of drunken Asians (red in face, yelling about something, and defensive about their height). That being said this establishment offers what any good pub should: cramped spaces, terrible lighting, and the stench of aged guilt and sleaze. Because it is only in places like this, where one truly will feel the need to drink until piss drunk. I've been meaning to go to this soccer pub forever to catch a game, and I finally went for the Sounders' last game of the year with friends. &#160;This place is just great. &#160;The fans of the EPL (English Premier League) were there before us cheering on their teams, and then the game came on about 30 minutes after we arrived. &#160;We had friends who arrived before us and saved our seats, but, this place wasn't as impossible to find seats at as some of the other soccer bars around town like Fuel or the pre-game bars near Quest. &#160;I liked that. &#160;You've got to love the European feel to it where you can just have a Guinness and a nice game. &#160;Great combination. excellent patio. spacious. with enough room for, say, three guys to have a random game of "dude, let me hit you in the balls until you cry pee out your eyes". any patio that big is good enough for me. i seriously haven't laughed that hard in forever. big selection of beers that i think are good. i only had one, though, since beer makes you tired and if you're already sleepy that doesn't help. they've got good looking bangers and mash. or, if you're on a theme week, WIENERS AND BEANS. my experience at george and dragon? wiener themed. wiener punching, wiener eating... ...wait. this is going down hill. it's not getting better. i give up. great place. cool folks at the bar. relaxed and nice patio when the weather is nice. Easy to find, even a few "private lot" parking stalls, and long hours - perfect for when you want to grab friends and watch a game while enjoying a pint or five from their great beer selection. &#160;Tad bit cave-like, but otherwise inviting with ample seating. &#160;Service is prompt and improves when you merrily find your own way to the bar instead of waiting for someone to always find you. &#160;Food is OK, not great but then again I never was a huge fan of British food. Four stars only for the fact that it's always SO flipping busy, and it's a bit off the beaten path from the rest of the pubs/bars in Fremont, I have to do a drunk walk down a broken up sidewalk past a nasty mini-mart and that just loses one star for me. Anyway, I have spent many a heavenly eve in the George &amp; Dragon. It's the cloest thing to an authentic British "pub" I've seen since my trip to London a few years ago. It's fabulous. the decor is wonderful and authentic, there is adequate outdoor seating, pool and darts for those non-busy times, and there's never a shortage of entertaining patrons. We once met a guy here who was pretending to be Russian to pick up chicks, he's been the butt-end of our jokes there ever since. It is a Fremont staple for me and my crew, always will be. Football, a pint in hand, and an english breakfast is a great way to start the day. I had heard great things about G&amp;D for football viewing and finally got around to heading over and watching some of the Euro Cup games live at 9am and noon. The food was great, and the bartenders kept everyone well supplied. The atmosphere was pretty much perfect, I will definitely be headed there again. Only been here late at night but have always had a good time. &#160;Bartenders always seem helpful and the drinks are reasonably priced. &#160;I really like hanging out on the patio. &#160;Its a welcome break from the usual Fremont crowd. probably more like 2.5 stars. &#160;great to find the elusive soccer game on the tellie but i always find the owners to be rude (if you aren't part of the "in" crowd, aka &#160;English) the place to be a bit shabby, not to mention when the &#160;threats from the bartender when you soccer team beat his (actually that was just funny).I prefer to hit the other pubs that show footie than come here. I've been to this place several times so I will comment on one of my memorable moments at this place...Last year, went here to drink for my birthday. &#160;The #1 reason why I love this bar is because they serve several British beers on Tap. &#160;I love them all...Boddington's, Bass, Tetley's, Newcastle, etc. &#160;After downing a number of beers, I remember telling one of the female bartenders (she was wearing glasses), that "she was hotter than Lisa Loeb". &#160;Don't worry, my better half knows...she's cool about it, lol. &#160;The bartender smiled and said thank you. &#160;Then I turned to my friends and tried to sing the Lisa Loeb song, "Stay"...i think it went like this, "You say... I only hear what I want to."...Yeah...it was embarassing but it was definitely good times...what can beat a night hanging out with friends, drinking british beers on tap and being around a hot bartender that I thought resembled Lisa Loeb (in all honesty, it was probably the glasses)!!! &#160;Something about women who wear glasses...hmm. &#160;Anyways, if you're looking for a cool, casual place to have a good beer and hang with friends, this is the place to go. Great place to watch the beautiful game. &#160;Order lunch early though - the kitchen gets busy. This place was hot, &#160;crowded and extremely stinky!!! I am not a fan and probably won't come back. Our favorite pub in town. Going to the George is comfy and fun every time. Also love watching Chelsea matches here... especially when a full English breakfast is involved! This bar is a little too dark and smokey for me - I hear it is a great place to watch true football (soccer), which I watch only through friends talking about it. They have an okay beer selection and if you want to watch a game and hang out in an English Pub atmosphere you can't beat it. My favorite bar in Fremont. &#160;Probably because it's the least pretentious bar in the area. &#160;Plus they have those outside decks which is always a plus! &#160;Definitely gets crowded which means it's it's slow to get drinks at times. &#160;But at least the drinks are strong! I miss going here as much as I used to. Definately a hotspot for the truly dedicated. We even had our friends' reception there- who'da thought??? popular place for the soccer &amp; rugby, and I love the spaciousness, the funny limericks on the walls, pool if you so desire, and the deck/patio. Plus cider, of course. Gotta have the cider. Went here to watch the Arsenal vs. Stoke CIty game on 11/1/2008. &#160;It had a pretty good atmosphere. &#160;Full, but not packed. &#160;The food was pretty good. &#160;I had bangers and mash. &#160;The beers are very UK-oriented which is good too. &#160;The game was interrupted a few times when the satellite signal was lost or something. &#160;I think this is a great place to go and find new friends and fellow supporters of your club. Pretty good fish and chips. &#160;They serve alcohol. &#160;Definitely the place to catch a soccer match on TV. I stumbled out of The George and Dragon last night after 5 pints, two shots, and a fantastic plate of Fish and Chips with peas.  I slowly weaved my way down the sidewalk and smiled, thinking about the same five British guys that are always at the Dragon hitting on any lady who walks through the door. The Dragon is a great place to pick up girls if you have an accent. Christ, I wish I had an accent.......The last time I drank at the Dragon I actually ended up waiting outside of the 7-11 down the street for a ride from a friend. I had drank too much, and didn't feel safe driving. While waiting, I got board and decided to press that that big red button that says emergency shut-off located on the side of the building. Surely in Freemont they wouldn't just leave a big unguarded red button that would actually turn off a gas station just sitting on the side of a wall. Don't they know there are drunks around here? Long story short, the clerk inside the 7-11 was unamused and wondered why I would doubt what the sign told me. Luckily my friend showed up before the police did.All that aside, the staff at the dragon is experienced enough to handle the crush of patrons that are always there on a Friday, or Saturday night, and polite enough to chat you up while you wait at the bar for your buddies to arrive on a slower evening. I've never had a bad time at The Dragon....P.S. Their bathroom reeks of British piss, or it could be American piss with a fake accent. Its hard to tell when you're drunk....... Best bar in Ballard/Freemont hands down. Great wait staff and awesome food. Don't expect the juke box to be open much, football is on telly most all the time. Great prices on imports (UK sized pints). Fish and chips, a couple Belhavens, and some good convo with the regulars and Gary the bartender is always a good time. Oh, and those who say they won't go back because the bar is dark, the bathrooms a little messy, and the Brit corner...good riddance. I love this place, and it loves me. &#160;The cocktails are stiff, and the beer selection is what it should be. &#160;This is a solid pub with a great atmosphere, and the regulars are worth getting to know. &#160;Come for a Friday night happy hour and watch the crowd morph throughout the evening; it's quite a show! I'm not really a beer person, or a fried food person, so it's probably a little odd that I like the pub atmosphere so much. I'm not sure if it's the casual vibe, less pretentiousness or the dark wood. &#160;The first time I went to the George &amp; Dragon, it felt like some sort of underground secret society. &#160;It's easy to miss when you're cruising through Fremont because it's set back off of the main drag. &#160;I may be biased since I go there quite a bit, but I always know when I go there that I'll receive a friendly greeting and efficient service. &#160;The staff is very cordial, and the crowd is usually laid-back and un-intimidating, though one might disagree if they walk in during a rousing European or English football match (who knew there were so many people in Seattle who were so passionate about European football??) &#160;The George &amp; Dragon is one of the few places you can go where random people will strike up conversations with you, you don't have to dress to impress, and you can order drinks at decent prices. &#160;And they have a full bar, so even a non-beer person like myself can indulge a little. &#160;For the beer lover, there is a wide variety of beers on tap, both domestics and imports. &#160;For the wine lover, I would suggest a gin &amp; tonic... Great place to watch soccer and grab a beer.
I am an expert on food. I have been eating at least twice a day every day since I was born, with the exception of Yom Kippur, so I think it's fair to say that I have a degree of &#160;experience that few can even hope to achieve, which is why I have "food expert" listed on my resume. You do not have it on your resume, ergo you are not an expert.Thaiger room introduced me to Phad Thai about 12 years ago, and they made quite the introduction. It is now my go-to food at any Thai restaurant. Everything from the noodles to the tofu to the MSG tasted delicious, and for a while this was the only restaurant that I would go for Thai food.Time has a way of vegetabling some things. At some point, they decided to stereotype their vegetarian Phad Thai by loading it with more vegetables than noodles, and their vegetables were both vegetables and not very good. Every time I would have to pick out the noodles one at a time from between all of the healthy food just to enjoy the Phad Thai I used to love.Their tofu was still acceptable, but they gave less of it. Their restaurant is incredibly hot and small, and on more than one occasion I would try to open the door and find it locked while they had an open sign on and people inside eating and a cook cooking something. I still think that back in the day they had ... maybe the second best Phad Thai ever. Now they're only okay, and the restaurant doesn't have the ambiance to make up for it. Lame. Oh Thaiger room. This place is decent, but overall, the food is just okay. I've come here numerous times, but mainly b/c the bf likes this place and there's some sentimental value in it for him (college days) and for us (dates). We usually order the tom yum noodle soup w xtra green beans and the pad see ew. The tom yum soup is good, but a bit sweet for my tastes. We always get the green beans b/c it adds a nice crunch to the soup. I've also tried other noodle dishes, their curries, and the fried rice.I'd pass on the rice and the curry is okay. The noodles have a good texture, but then again, the overwhelming theme here is that most of their dishes are really quite sweet. Taste-wise, I prefer other thai places, but overall, I don't mind coming here...I just wouldn't CHOOSE to come here if given the choice.Price-wise, it's cheap. about $18 for 2 dishes and service is quick even when it's busy. Update again after a 6th, and improved visit. &#160; After my 6th visit, I still love the Golden Noodles. This is how peanut sauce and noodles should be done! Curry portion sizes are inconsistent, unfortunately. Pros: Been here twice and both times the phad thai had been either way to spicy or way to sweet but overall still good. The peanut sauce with spinach and chicken is only pretty good. They also use thick grain rice instead of thin grain which is a nice.Cons: The food is only okay which is the main reason why it only gets 3 stars though the atmosphere and the service doesnt help. You will literally only see the waitress for your order and when she gives you your food. Service isn't super but it's not terrible either. The inside of the building is usually dark and pretty small.Overall: I will be back cause they stay open pretty late and the food is decently price for their portions. I think Thaiger Room's food is really yummy, actually. &#160;However, in comparison to other Thai restaurants, I feel that their servings are very, very small for the price. &#160;I'm not a big fan of ordering dishes where half the plate is rice, either. &#160;I think it'd be better ordered on the side or something. &#160;The service is fine, nothing impressive. This food is quite good, let me just say that. So far I've tried the phad see ew and the pad thai, both with tofu. UHM, how come it took me so long to try this place!? Their noodles are very good, the sauces are good, the portions are good, the employees are friendly. The atmosphere is a little eh, but that's a small price to pay for good food. Did I mention it's fairly cheap? I think that most dishes end up being around seven or eight dollars. When you get take-out they let you have a seat and they bring you a glass of ice water. Isn't that nice?! I wish more places did that. Anyways, this is all around a great place and you should go go go! It was my second time trying out this place and I loved it even more the second time! Last night, my boyfriend and I decided to have a late night dinner. We both ordered the chicken pad thai and pangang curry. The food was amazing. The portions was very reasonable. The service was great. This place is fairly small but it has a big vibrant atmosphere. I will be coming back here for sure! i like this place the food is always good. I always get pad thai with extra noodle and meat, bomb. The owner Tony also owns Kai's bistro up the block, you should also check that place out for drinks. I generally get their pad see ew and am pretty satisfied most of the time. Their spicy levels kind of bounce around (I always order a "2" and its sometimes a LOT spicier than I'm used to) but I'm guessing it varies a little depending on what they cooked in the pan right before my fish. Decently priced, not extravagantly expensive but not super cheap either. A little grungy for my taste, in terms of cleanliness but not terrible (and I'm pretty nit picky about being clean so my standards may be a little higher - let's just say I'm not a big fan of sticky walls). Their service is always really friendly though, and I've never had a bad experience in that aspect.Its just a shame that there are so many other Thai places on the Ave that Thaiger Room has to compete with, as I think I usually choose to go someplace else if craving Thai food. Wonderful Tom Yum Soup. Everything else is kind of hit or miss (kind of inconsistent). Three words: Late. Night. Run. Whenever my friends and I are mad craving good wholesome thai food, we make the effort to catch bus 31 to The Ave. I was introduced to Thaiger Room by a guy friend when he decided to bring me in. I was a bit skeptical at first considering I'm not exactly a fan of thai food. He ordered the pad thai (no. 5) and insisted I try some. I'm extremely glad I did because the pad thai was bomb! Ever since then, I've had their pad thai, curry fried rice (which by the way is amaazing!) and pad see ew. I always tend to order the curry fried rice with chicken. It comes with chopped and grilled pineapples, carrots, broccoli, onions, cilantro, and green onion. Ironically, a lot of the neighboring Udub students prefer Toms Thai over Thaiger Room, but my friends and I are all for Thaiger Room. The place is rarely hectic and the co-owner/waitress always greets the customers with a big, brace-faced smile. The service is friendly and inviting and the overall aroma of the restaurant isn't overbearing at all like most thai restaurants. Not to mention the restaurant is open until 2am! The portions are relatively big and if you're a food lover like I am, you'll enjoy the variety of dishes Thaiger Room has to offer! I promise you'll leave the restaurant with a full belly and a huge smile on your face.
3.5The pho here is SO cheap! &#160;I ordered a small for $4.95, and couldn't even finish that. &#160;The broth's flavor was good and they didn't skimp on the meat. &#160;Service was quick, and they accept credit cards for orders over $10.The free cream puff is a plus, but next time I'd definitely pass on that. &#160;Mine was stale and not worth the extra calories.Great place for a cheap meal! Went here back during Spring Break so it's been a while but the food was good. I found the prices were also pretty cheap considering the portion sizes!The complimentary cream puffs were a definite treat. I will never go back to this restaurant!! They're more expensive than other Pho restaurants, they charge you if you use your credit/debit cards, and their pastry is always a little dry. Tran Brothers Pho a few doors down from is much better and even a little cheaper. Their pastry is always fresh. I just recently moved to Seattle from Oregon. I've gone to this place twice since living in the Ballard area. The first time I came I order pho ga (chicken) to my surprise it was pretty decent. There was an abundance of chicken and cheap! The second time I came I order the the vegetation pho. I would prefer non-fried tofu and a little more veggie, again I can't complain on the price. Next time I go I'll stick to pho ga.
I have a bad habit. I often go long periods throughout the day without eating, just so at the climax of hunger I can spend all my calories... in a huge blaze of glory!!!!!!!Belle Epicurean is a great place to do this.When I'm downtown shopping literally until I'm about to drop, there's nothing like getting a revival in the form of flawless pastry and strong coffee. Yesterday I was in desperate need and found solace in a rich cappuccino and, more importantly, brioche with honeyed pears, toasted almond slivers, and rum-soaked raisins. I'm sorry, WHAT?! How dare they. Plus the chef was trained at Le Cordon Bleu and has all sorts of rave reviews on the wall along with her diploma. Impressed? Because I am. I sat there and devoured my 700 calorie snack (served on delicate, beautiful china, obviously they don't know my clumsy ass because they should not be trusting me) in front of a huge mirror. Front-row seats to my gluttony, awesome.Hint: It's only open til 2 on weekends, also it's tiny and easy to miss. So keep your eyes out for the statue of the fat French chef in the entry (or, the statue of what I will eventually look like if I give into every Belle Epicurean craving... I want to go back right NOW...) The almost-hidden-bakery! &#160;On my croissant tour of Seattle, this place gets full marks for A.) being downtown, B.) having a lovely environment, and C.) having delicious pastries. &#160;The almond croissant I had was quite good. &#160;(Made more authentically French by not being oversweet, but I actually like oversweet.) &#160;While not perhaps my favorite croissant in the city, it was WARM which ups the verdict, places that bake croissants on-site in the middle of the day are few and far between. &#160;I believe this bakery's niche may be in their brioches, which I hear are excellent, and they even had Buche de Noel in the cabinet which made me feel like having a little French christmas right there and then!The cafe is small and elegant (watch out you'll miss it), the next time I go, I fully intend to have a cup of tea and hang out a little. &#160;The proximity to my work makes it the most likely to be hit up on a regular basis. Holy crap YUMMMERS!After seeing the reviews of this place I new I had to stop in on my last trip to Seattle. I wanted to basically eat everything they had in the place it all looked so yummy.My husband and I ordered three things. The classic pecan bun, a potato and rosemary croissant and the ham and gruyere flalalfthaklad thingy!They were all very tasty and our favorite was the ham and cheese thing.My husband had a coffee or a "drip" as they say there and I had a hot chia. My husband wasn't a big fan of the coffee but that didn't stop him from having three cups.We ended up going there two out of the three days that we were there. bri-oche (bre-osh,-osh)n. &#160;A soft, light-textured bread made from eggs, butter, flour, and yeast and formed into a roll or a bun. heav-en-ly (hev-uh n-lee)adj.

"belle epicurean...belle epicurean...belllleeeee...epiiiii..cuuuureaaaaan..&#173;"i found myself singing the name of this lovely bakery/cafe allllll day &#160;(and a few random days) after experiencing the best taste i've had in a long time! (no joke, my bf can vouch for how annoyed he was of my song) smoked salmon baguette ($7ish) + plain crossaint ($3ish) &#160;= heavendon't you love it when you eat a crossaint and the flakes get all over your shirt -- and you don't care! *licks lips*"...belle epicurean...belle epicurean!"i think they close @ 6 on weekdays, 4 on saturdays -- and i don't know what time sundays. but that means 7 days to make my heart melt! Phenomenal. &#160;Find any excuse to go here: &#160;shop downtown, pretend you're shopping downtown, whatever...just go. &#160;Now. &#160;The pastries we tried were ham/Gruyere and potato/rosemary croissants. &#160;Quite frankly the best pastries we have had in town yet. This little bakery hits the spot with their savory and sweet pastries and coffee. &#160;We tried the potato rosemary brioche, spicy corn and cheese croissant, and the pear cranberry pastry - all delish!
Chicken- moist (I am using my least favorite word to describe it, that is how good it is).Rice- PerfectTeriyaki Sauce- DivinePot stickers- MMmmmmThis is the ONLY teriyaki joint I will go to anymore. I have searched high and low in Seattle for the perfect chicken with the perfect sauce and this is it. They were kind of new when I first went in (what appeared to be the opening week)...but they worked the kinks out (staffing, not food) and it is a pleasure. The portions are huge, it always takes me two sittings to finish it all off (plus I ask for the cucumbers on the side which makes room for more on my plate :)I actually just finished off my takeout, and had to write a review...... Only have had the spicy teriyaki and its been good both times. I like the sliced cucumber salad they serve with it, it balances out the heat.a bit expensive for some yaki if you ask me, but not by much.. Good chicken, just beware of the Daily Special/Lunch Special mix-ups.Always ask if your Teriyaki comes with Gyoza. Don't assume it does.
Somtam Thai is a newcomer on the Ave. and the food is great! The owners have a lunch place downtown and have expanded to this location in order to spread the love. The prices are totally reasonable and the hospitality and generosity of the owners is tough to beat. The usual staples are all great but what makes their menu unique is that they offer four kinds of Som Tam (shaved Papaya salad) as well as a bunch of other dishes that aren't as common on American Thai menus like three variations on Laarb; one a warm chicken salad mixed with shallots, mint, scallions, lime juice and roasted rice powder and the others with pork or sliced beef. They also serve Gai Yang, a northern-style grilled chicken that has become ubiquitous throughout Thailand but isn't commonly available at most restaurants here in the states. Make sure you get some sticky rice to go with any of these dishes as it is the traditional accompaniment. I also love any of their soups and the Pad See Yew and Garlic Beef/Chicken. One thing to note: the owners are used to accommodating American tolerances for spicy food so if you aren't a complete wuss I would definitely recommend going higher on the spice scale if you like a little kick.
The BEST prices on Japanese food stuffs around town, beats Uwajimiya easily. &#160;Staff actually speaks Japanese, rare these days in the Seattle area. &#160;Small on the inside but big on heart and service. &#160;Plenty of fresh choices at the deli the bento boxes are #1 in my opinion in flavor and selection. &#160;Flavors remind me of how my Aunt used to cook for us, old skool baby, yeah! &#160;Their lunch counter is served up hot and fresh, no leftovers from the day before but get there early for the best choices. &#160;Portions are good and the choices suit almost everyone and to top it off, the food tastes really GOOD!My kids luv to make the trip down to this store as the selection of Japanese cookies, cakes, candies, beverages, and snack items are varied and priced just right. &#160;Personally in my opinion the isle of pickled veggies is amazing!Worth the trip to Georgetown to try it out, even if we live in Shoreline! Uwaji is rip off, but Maruta is friendly price! I love their osouzai too ...!
Decent pho &amp; spring rolls. The large bowl is way too big for one. Good lunch spot. My girlfriend and I recently discovered Pho Viet Anh.Since discovering this jewel, we have dined there over a dozen times. &#160;This is one of our favorite restaurants. &#160;It is affordable, fast, friendly, and an all around great dining experience.Henry and Carol own the restaurant and obviously take great pride in their establishment. The restaurant is cozy, in the evening the lighting and tapestries create a romantic environment.When we visit, Henry greets us by name and makes us feel at home. &#160;We like to start with a pot of hot tea while trying to decide what to order. &#160;In our many visits, we have ordered most of the vegetarian and chicken dishes. The chicken and vegetarian Pho are delicious. &#160;The Vegetarian Fresh Spring Rolls are amazing. &#160;The chicken and vegetarian curry dishes are to die for. &#160;Yesterday I ordered the Lemongrass Chicken, which I loved.If you are looking for a great place for Vietnamese food, this is the place. The Pho Viet Anh is a place I sometimes go to have Pho Ga, drink some tea, and read a little. I do this because the staff is very friendly and accomodating, and always have the courtesy of making certain you have fresh tea. The yellowish decor is nothing much to speak of, but it's quaint and suffices. The exterior of the building on Roy is a bit confusing-- it's a bit of a hole in the wall, but it is right next to Thai Heaven. The key difference with Pho Viet Anh's soup broth is that it is not overly salty, it seems to be richer, tastes just like mom may have made it, and I have verified that it does not contain MSG. While I did not take it to a lab, I do have a friend who went there with me and she is very allergic to MSG, and she had no problems whatsoever. I do like the spring rolls-- they are fresh. There's the typical Sriracha sauce available (also refered to as "rooster sauce" or "hot cock sauce") for those who like to burn their mouths and intestines like I do. Of the 3 Pho places I usual eat at, this one is the least expensive and is by far the friendliest.I like good Pho, and good hospitality, and don't like to feel rushed. If this is the kind of place you seek, then I encourage you to try it out.
