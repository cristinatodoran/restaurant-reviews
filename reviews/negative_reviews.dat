I'm only giving this place 5 stars for the severe nostalgia it invoked when I walked in the door. &#160;Growing up as a vegetarian in San Jose, CA, the epicenter of the Vietnamese community in Northern California, my family and I quickly leaned on the support of the local tofu deli and fell in love with the variety of foods they offered.This place stands up to the competition down South, I believe. &#160;The offer up fresh foods, like red curry, stuffed bitter melon, stir fried mock fish (mm...), bean curd egg rolls, regular egg rolls, a variety of bean/legume based desserts, and fresh tofu and soy milk! &#160; ahh! &#160;out of control. &#160;A vegan's paradise! &#160;The Banh mi is also pretty delicious and I think 2.75 a pop, however prices are not listed and that's my estimate from a breakdown of a bill of $19 for a ton of food.Caution for Vegans though - Banh Mi traditionally has mayonnaise, so just ask for a sandwich without any and you're good to go. I LOVE THIS PLACE! 5 STARS!!Let me start by saying this deli is ALL VEGAN! &#160;Being a vegetarian white person who doesn't know any Vietnamese, it's awesome and reassuring to go into a Vietnamese deli and be able to order anything and know it doesn't have hidden animal products lurking within!I love ChuMinh's tofu and have been eating it for years, so I'm very excited that they finally opened a deli serving tofu-laden vegan dishes!I've even gotten my meat-eating boyfriend addicted to this place. &#160;We usually order the 2 entree dinner combo ($6) with red rice (super delicious!!) and we pick 2 entrees that look good that day. &#160;So far I've had the mixed vegetables, tofu curry, tofu and greens, and a special tofu thing with pineapple and mushrooms and vegetables that they had made as a one-day experiment. &#160;We also order banh mi ($2.75) to save for lunch the next day. &#160;My favorite is the spicy lemongrass tofu. &#160;Last time we went on a weekday at about 7:30pm (they close at 8) and they were out of lemongrass tofu so we got onion instead which I was happy with. &#160;I've also gotten the tofu spring rolls ($2) which were very delicious! &#160;The $6 dinner combo is easily enough food for 2-3 people as it comes in a full-size compostable take-out container with generous servings. &#160;This place is pretty tiny and they have one dining table in the middle. &#160;It's best to get your food to-go and pay with cash. &#160;They take credit cards (with a $0.50 charge for transactions under $5) but I think their machine is very slow and/or doesn't work sometimes. &#160;I tried to pay with a card once and she said the machine wasn't working properly so I ended up paying with cash instead. &#160;Taxes are built into the prices, and be sure to throw some cash into the tip jar. Good food! Tasty! Good value. Good for you. Small hole in the wall tofu cafe I was surprised how good it was. Different and interesting dishes.Been there twice now!! Best vegan b&#225;nh m&#236; I've ever had in a deli/restaurant. &#160;$2.75 with hearty serving of tofu. &#160;Great! I recently popped in to this place and now I'm obsessed with their red curry. &#160;One lady that helped me last time was really nice, and everything came out SO CHEAP. &#160;I never had to pay anymore than 10$ and they give you a ton, so i've made several meals out of one take out. &#160;good deal! All the dishes were delicious and the people working there were delightful! &#160;Can't wait to tell all my friends about one of my new favorite vegetarian spots. Super awesome tofu banhmi; they let me try it with the chili, lemongrass, and green onion all in one and it was great. Someone else described the ladies working there as your "favorite Vietnamese aunt" - never had one, but that's how I'd imagine them to be. Seems you can't go wrong with ordering the stuff there, it all looks really good. The lemongrass tofu's so good I like eating it straight, and the curry tofu dish I had was pretty tasty. Want to go back and try their veggie pho. I love this place. &#160;My wife and I eat here all the time
"ewww.....bleh..." &#160;sums up my bao experience at Yak's. &#160;I made a detour over to Fremont after Yelping "Bao" &#160; I bought the last two BBQ Pork Baos. &#160;It held promise. &#160;The steam wafting out the sweatin' Bao Cabinet and the site of the last two seemingly soft &#160;mounds of the baos made me salivate. &#160;I take my baos home, opened my container, sigh and sunk my teeth into the bao. &#160; Then...a crashing disappointment. &#160;This is the most DIGUSTING bao I've ever had. &#160;What is this ground pork chinese sloppy joe $hit?! &#160;It is so bad, I immediately closed the container and off it went into the trash shoot. :-( Now I'm off to forage for more food. &#160;I wish I knew how to cook.... This is not the Yak's I used to frequent in the 90's, but then again the Still Life cafe up the street is replaced by some upscale nonsense. Not bad teriyaki I guess, seen better days though in my opinion. Teriyaki was &#160;pretty tastey, the rice Was just ok. They have wifi if you ask for the password
This is my fallback dim sum place when the wait at Jade is too long. &#160;Sun Ya has much better congee than Jade. it's rare when the service makes me pipin' mad. &#160;hey, i think i'm a conscientious guy. &#160;i pick up litter at parks, i pet stray cats, and i put &#160;many a stripper through college. &#160;at first, this place was cool. &#160;parking is free, the dim sum oilier than a teenager's face, all good qualities. &#160;the ladies zooming their carts along the narrow spaces between tables, more entertaining than teatro zinzanni. &#160;i'd like to see one of those acrobats try what these dim sum cart ladies master the craft of pushing steaming piles of dumplings and zoom away. &#160;it's like selling cigarettes to kids, they make it look so easy! &#160;my gripe is the final bit of service. &#160; i'm covered in ink as in tattooed. &#160;my friend has them too all over his bald head. &#160;now, in some Asian circles, particularly the old skool way of looking at things, tattoos are frowned upon. &#160;so is having your wife's feet unbound and not looking like little moon crescents(see foot binding). &#160;yup. &#160;walking wives are a shocker. &#160;in any case, the old fart puts the check on our table while we're still EATING. &#160;and stands there. &#160;and stands. and waits. &#160;stands. waits. &#160;what is he doing? &#160;i don't know. &#160;you tell me, dear reader. &#160;looks like he wants my friend and i to pay the bill and leave! &#160;for what? &#160;having tattoos?it turns out my friend is an IT manager and i'm in the similar field, cuz that's the only way we could afford tattoos. &#160;the shit is fucking expensive. &#160;it's too bad, cuz i was digging the place up to that point. &#160;we were even behaving properly, we were talking about work, for chrissakes. &#160;if you're going to judge me for my looks. &#160;look at my ass. &#160;it's like prince's and his &#160;is iconic. &#160;do you remember his pants at the MTV music awards? &#160;when i first saw it, i'm surprised i didn't turn into a pillar of salt!my friend wasn't mad. &#160;he was like, 'i've accepted that having these kinds of tattoos will mark you'. &#160;maybe i took it a little too personally, i was raised in a old skool asian household. &#160;and i fucking hated it. &#160;i believe wives deserve the right to walk. &#160;i wanted to tell ol' maggot dick, 'hey, pal, welcome to america, people with tats are human too! &#160;i'm not an animal! &#160;(weep) i'm not an animal..." I think this place deserves a higher rating! &#160;Have not been here in forever but chose this in Chinatown because it's close to our grandma's nursing home. The service is excellent, attentive and staff with the dim sum cart was friendly enough. &#160;The food was good - some items we like are not offered here but it was still a good meal. &#160; Parking can be challenging but that goes for everywhere in Chinatown - they have a small lot. &#160;We found street parking ok though around 11:30m on a Saturday morning.Only negative is that they don't have those lazy susans for the large round tables. &#160;Getting to all the dimsum is challenging but luckily we get two of almost every item! &#160;:-) In terms of dim sum I was a bit disappointed. But due to the rapid turn around the stuff was fresh. &#160;There are only 4 types of carts: Steam, Dessert, Fried, and Congee. &#160;The selection was really dismal. &#160;They had the usual har gao, sui mai, chicken feet (white), bean curd, noodle wrapped shrimp, pai gu, eggplant stuffed with meat, kai lan, beans, fried rice, lotus wrapped rice, etc.Still not great if you're looking for dim sum...I would go for some where else better recommended. &#160;Also the parking lot's tiny, but the parking's free. Came with here with a group of friends and we sat at the bar so we can watch the football games. &#160;There's no carts rolling by at the bar but you can order dim sum from the menu. &#160;My friend is a regular here so service was good and the lady came back with all fresh dim sum, can't beat that. &#160;Prices seem lower compared to other places in Chinatown. Haven't been to Sun Ya in forever but I was craving dim sum and didn't want to wait an hour for Jade Garden or Harbor City. The food is pretty good and CHEAP!!! Dim sum for 4 was $17.50 and we were stuffed. Service was ehh.... Check this place out if you want cheap decent dim sum. But if you want good dim sum, just walk on up the hill and look for the crowd of people standing outside of restaurants. I have been here a few times and the one reason I think I keep going back is the pea vine greens in garlic sauce. Absolutely my favorite dish and not all that common. &#160;I have had the chicken corn soup and enjoyed that as well. Tonight we had the pea vines, tomato beef noodle soup and chicken egg foo young. &#160;Well the pea vines were excellent as usual. &#160;My boyfriend really enjoyed the soup but then he loves anything with tomato and beef in the name. I have to admit though, it looked good and the one taste I had seemed pretty tasty. Now the egg foo young. &#160;I don't know how many of you have ever tried this. It is not that popular a dish and is not even on the menu in many Chinese restaurants. I believe it is something traditionally made with leftovers and not considered something you would serve to guests or customers. &#160;Nevertheless it is found here and there and has always been one of my favorite splurges. &#160;It is typically a greasy omelet with beans sprouts, meat or fish and other vegetables (onions, peas, water chestnuts, etc). &#160;Served with gravy it is not recommended for those with cardiac disease. &#160;Well, that is what I had in mind when I ordered. &#160;What I was served was something different. It seemed to me that they added some sort of starch to the omelet part, it seemed more doughy or perhaps started out like some sort of batter. &#160;The egg was not really detectable except for a yellowish color. It had no taste until I put a lot of soy sauce and white pepper on it after which it was edible. &#160;Huge bummer. &#160;I regret not sending it back or at least asking "what is this?"Yes the windows are filthy and there is nothing fancy about the bathroom but let me know when you find a Chinese restaurant in the international district that is different. &#160;The service is so-so. &#160;Parking almost always available and is a huge plus. In fact I think were were headed somewhere else tonight and couldn't find a parking place so ended up here. I agree with Lady W that this place deserves a higher rating - the food is good! It may be a bit crowded, not to clean (especially the bathroom), and the parking is hard to find on Sundays, but the service is curteous, fast, and, did I mention?, the food is good. This place is awesome. Clean, fast service and best of all fresh and yummy good. I only go for dim sum and I have to say it's my tops in Seattle !
Sun Ya = zzzzzzzzzzzThere is absolutely no variety here. I think we got some hum bao, shrimp dumplings, peking duck and mango pudding, but that's about it. The food itself was decent quality despite being cold, but I was really bored and hungry waiting around for a cart or some service. The service was also pretty rude here and I felt very ignored.I guess if you like peking duck, this is the place to go, but don't expect much else here. I used eat here with my family for dim sum all the time when I was young, but I recently tried it out again a few times recently and found that the food hasn't been very good. It's just not as good as it used to be. But that doesn't mean it's bad. Actually, I still recommend it if you're in Chinatown and looking for some pretty decent dim sum. Although the quality of the food has declined in the years I still enjoy it! It's great to go with family too. So you should try it out whoever is reading this! The end. I have to admit that i have been spoiled with great dim sum. Trips to hong kong, Vancouver, Monterey park and living in SF. This place has A minimal dim sum selection. They didn't have woo gok! (fried taro puff) or xiao lung bao. hello! Wth?? Cart ladies were friendly enough. They spoke english and one was even young and fluent. Service was fine. We weren't really motivated to eat much at all. Had the har gow (shrimp dumpling) which was decent, shrimp in rice roll (not quite up to par but edible, wrap was not soft) and chicken feet (nothing to write home or yelp about). &#160;the diet coke was so watered down, there was no flavor or caramel color. What a joke. How do you screw up a diet coke? 1/2 star penalty for the soda brings us to 1.5 starsWe really really tried to eat more but even being almost 5 months pregnant, not much looked appealing ( and i can ALWAYS EAT). Total bill $11.40. Wow, that's a an all-time lowI shoulda listened to my fellow yelpers than take the advice of our Asian concierge dude at the westin. Lesson learned. Seated quickly for a large group. &#160;The carts came around quickly. &#160;Here is where I will probably get my chinese card revoked though. &#160;It didn't look that good. It also didn't taste that good. &#160;=(  And I agree with other reviewers, the cart ladies didn't know enough english to communicate to their patrons, so they came off as abrupt, even rude. &#160;This became an issue when one of our party wanted a diet coke. &#160;Finally management brought a coke, and it was so watered down it was more "diet" than expected. Had a hankering for almond boneless chicken with gravy but was not willing to drive over I-90 to South China, which has the best ABC. A friend had suggested Sun Ya, which we have visited several times for dim sum and big Chinese banquets. &#160;Sat in the bar and ordered the ABC, soy sauce chow mein w BBQ pork, and asked what kind of vegetables they had. &#160;Ordered the pea vines with some beef, figuring that you were supposed to order a meat with it. &#160;The bill seemed a little high and we then noticed that the pea vines were $14.95!!! Asked if that was right, and she said it was a dollar more because of the beef. &#160;My god - who would pay $13.95 for pea vines without meat?? &#160;Got all the stuff home, after going back in for the forgotten rice, and unpacked it all. &#160;The chicken, was like a beige color and not at all golden brown. The saving grace was the breast meat. &#160;Almonds were sitting atop the gravy, which was only a slightly darker shade of beige. &#160;It was good, not great, and definitely did not measure up to South China's. The chow mein was good, but a little skimpy on the meat. Those expensive pea vines? Good, but I'm not sure why Chinese restaurants do that weird thing with baking soda to their meat. &#160;It makes it soft and squishy. I'd rather eat a tougher piece of beef than a spongy chunk. &#160;Next time I'll have to ask my favorite waiter Philip what/how to order...
Dim Sum for lunch on a drizzly day in Seattle. &#160;'Guarded parking lot' mostly to keep out non patrons from parking.Seated in a booth right away and dim sum carts came by quickly.Noted that the servers were much more friendly by saying 'enjoy' after serving and making recommendations, so good stars for service.All in all, hot dim sum, good service and tasty, no complaints.Priced reasonably too. Okay look....I'm not a super big Dim Sum expert, but I know when its good, so I'll keep this short.Sun-Ya sucks. My lady and I popped in for lunch when we were running errands in the ID. The place is huge, and has a lot of good seating, but then you have to deal with the wait-staff.The gals pushing around the dim sum carts were pretty much terrifying. If you didn't know EXACTLY what you wanted when they arrived, you got scowled at, cursed to in Chinese, and then they simply bailed out on you.The dim sum was less than pleasing too. Everything was fairly rubbery and old tasting. &#160;Seattle has a BOUNTY of awesome Asian cuisine. Save yourself from a bad experience and try somewhere else in the ID for dim sum before you go here. This was the worst dim sum experience I have ever had!We went there by recommendation from Nancy Leson, the Seattle Times food writer and found ourselves very disappointed. The food was only so-so as far as dim sum in Seattle goes. Some items were supposed to be served warm but were served cold. The waitresses were shouting at each other over the customers' heads. We were short 1 tea cup and it took asking 4 times (including the restaurant owner) to get it to us. When the cup arrived, it was dirty! I would like to say something nice but I can't think of anything. Yes, there is parking but good luck trying to find a spot. There are many choices for dim sum in the international district in Seattle, skip this one. I wouldn't go there if it were free! What the Hell, people. This place has perfectly acceptable dim sum, and it's cleaner than most places I've been in Vancouver, New York, or Hong Kong. Double happiness. Four stars. Seventeen black holes. Avogadro's number of carbon molecules. I hereby declare this place to be tripleplus good, and detractors can bite my shiny metal ass. Oh no! There are a million people waiting outside Jade Garden! I didn't know so many people had Veteran's Day off. What now??!?!?! I don't know about you, but once I've got dim sum on my mind, there's no stopping me! The BF and I were wandering the streets of the ID for a restaurant that A) wasn't crazy busy like Jade Garden B) not totally empty, eek! C) serving dim sum Luckily, we came across Sun Ya and only waited about 5 minutes for a table. The service was friendly and the food was good. It wasn't my favorite, but I left satisfied and full! The shu mai was especially delicious! I'd come back again. Sun Ya is not the best restaurant in the I.D., nor is it the cheapest. In fact, the best way to describe the place is, "pretty average".What distingushes Sun Ya, and earns it a fourth star, is the consistent (if unremarkable) food quality, the better than average service, and free parking.The free parking, in particular, is a joy... if only because of the crabby old parking attendent. While he may be grouchy, and his English is imperfect, he can be an absolute charmer with old ladies and young children. I don't know why there are so many bad reviews, this place is definitely a 4-star dim sum joint. &#160;Good service. &#160;Lots of tables. &#160;Many dim sum selections to choose from. &#160;And of course, inexpensive. Friendly service and well executed and fresh dim sum makes Sun Ya a first choice for dim sum. &#160;Slightly broader choices are also a welcome change from the standards. &#160;Best dim sum outside of Vancouver. Sun Ya is a very poor representation of how good Chinese food can taste. In fact, I don't think I've ever felt so disappointed with Chinese food in my life.My family and I came here last week for a small, private dinner banquet to celebrate the birth of a cousin's cousin. I'd been to Sun Ya a couple of times when I was a kid, and I had nothing against the food then, but oh how ignorant kids can be...*shakes head*The restaurant itself is spacious, perfect for larger gatherings and easy for dim sum carts to navigate. There's even a parking lot outside, which makes this restaurant very attractive for those who are too lazy to find street parking. The service is friendly, too. However, that's about all I can remember of the good things.First off, why were the walls dirty? I'm sure that decades ago the walls must have been white, but they sure haven't been cleaned in a while. Second, why were there no turntables on any of the tables? When the tradition is family-style meals and there's usually eight to ten courses on the table at a time, it is ESSENTIAL to have the turntable. No one wants to lean over the table to pick up food or have to keep shuffling dishes around. Third, there is something very wrong when you see lip smudges on the glasses. Isn't it a requirement for everything to be thoroughly washed before placing it back on the table?As for the food...boy, don't even get me started. The appetizer plate (jellyfish with assorted meats) was not cold, but lukewarm. Jellyfish is best served chilled, but it felt like the dish had been sitting on the counter for a while. Next came the standard shark fin soup, which was lukewarm and seriously lacked in flavor. I dumped plenty of pepper in to try and liven things up, but even that couldn't save it. Then came the duck in small buns, which was actually alright, but the buns looked oddly deformed, lumpy instead of smooth. The walnut prawns weren't bad, either. Our steamed fish was huge, but because of its size (or maybe it was overcooked), the meat was tough and dry. The beef and broccoli dish reminded me of a chewier McDonald's burger, while the fried rice, crab, and lobster were only average. There was another vegetable dish - spinach, I believe - but I didn't try that because of my vendetta against the leafy greens. Also surprising was that no rice was served. I know some restaurants ask that you order it separately, but they should really start including it with the banquets. It simply feels wrong to be eating Chinese food without any rice.After we finished our meal, I noticed a very bare fish tank in the corner of the room. When I stepped closer to examine it, I saw what looked to be a few goldfish and some small koi. Nothing else was in the tank except for the fish: no gravel, no fake coral, no bright tank decorations. These poor fish looked so sad and neglected, it was depressing. If you're looking for dim sum quickly in Chinatown without all the hassle of waiting in line to be seated, this is your place. But be sure to know that the reason why people wait at the other places is because the food is better there. After getting that out of the way, Sun Ya is great for what it is.They have super nice folks who make the experience really welcoming. But when it came to the food -- it was just meh. We got a real good assortment of humbao, shumai, shrimp balls, rice noodles, bean curds, sticky rice, etc. They were all pretty ok. Not great like the food at Jade Garden or Top Gun in Factoria.Would I go here again? Probably. Only if there 1 hour before a Seahawks game and I'm hungry and wanted to go to dim sum. This place is perfect for that. Not the best food, but not the worst either. I love the variety of dim sum they have and I always go here for that REALLY yummy calamari. The steamed dumplings are always in abundance and I really love the fried pork belly. However, I recently went there and I feel like the dishes were a little cold and weren't the tastiest. Maybe it was just that day. But really when it comes down to it (this will sound bad- don't judge me!) but I really like coming here because they always have parking, seating, and a lot of food to choose from. Convenience is key when it comes to my hunger and for this reason, I go to Sun Ya.
I'm just your unsophisticated, limited-travel white-guy--but I like dim sum and I like Sun Ya's dim sum. There's a bigger place with more parking down the street, but? that place is a leeetle dingy, like with old food on the floor, so then i worry what the kitchen looks like. Sun Ya is clean everywhere, including the bathroom--which is my criteria for Chinese restaurants. And, Sun Ya has lots of carts with lots of choices. Now that I think of it--the other place had deep-fried chicken feet but I don't think Sun Ya did. So I do visit the other place maybe 1 out of 5 times. The rest is Sun Ya.And am I surrounded by other round-eyes when I go to Sun Ya? Naw, I'd say the customers are about 80%+ Asian. Very Asian. Now maybe they are 5th generation Koreans from Bellevue--how would I know? Surprised by the crummy reviews - the only thing I can think of is that things have changed (there are some dates ~3 yrs old on some of the negative reviews).I've been coming here on and off for over a year now and would recommend it to any friends looking for dim sum in the ID. &#160;A Chinese friend recommended it and now a group of us make it an ongoing occasion - I usually make it down for dim sum every other month or so (I try to avoid busy weekends during football or baseball games). &#160;I have always had great service (like the server who notices I empty my water glass a lot-- brings me a pitcher!), a friendly waitstaff who help with special requests (like when they don't have the kongee I love), and very reasonable prices. &#160;The steamed hum bao has always been fluffy and flavorful and the ha gau has been tasty &amp; fresh. &#160;Our large groups usually come out of there stuffed - for about $10-12pp!I've never noticed any insects or other dirty areas; the place is a little shabby on the inside, but I haven't ever seen it untidy or dirty. brought mom here for dinner and we had the singapore chow mein and honey walnut prawns. &#160;food was very bland :( &#160;i used to go here 9 years ago and i remember it being THE place to get your Chinese food on but not so much anymore. &#160;not sure about their dim sum...surely it has to be better than dinner. &#160;staff were nice, place was clean, although bathroom could've been scrubbed a little more. sun ya is probably one of the oldest restaurants in seattle's chinatown. &#160;i remember coming here when i was a wee tike with my parents for dinners, parties and dim sum. &#160;although they did do a remodel a couple of years ago, stepping into this place, you feel like you went back in time almost 40 years ago. &#160;this place reminds me of going back in time to the 70's. &#160;the restrooms are kind of creepy, maybe because it's a little dim in there, it seems like someone's gonna jump out of the stall and jump you, hah hah. &#160;ok, so enough bashing of the ambiance and atmosphere, let's get to the food. &#160;dim sum here really isn't bad, it's always piping hot and the prices are very favorable. &#160;however, the variety is slim, pretty much most of the dim sum items are dim sum staples you can find at any dim sum restaurant; that's a shame because the food they do have is good. &#160;the service is pretty good for a chinese place, your tea and water are almost always topped off, a big plus. &#160;they do have a parking lot, but it is almost always full, you are better off finding street parking. &#160;so, to cap it all off, the food is good, variety is lacking, service is good, parking can be difficult, and the ambiance? &#160;let's just say they need to do a major overhaul of the whole place. this place used to rock my world with their ginger and green onion dungeness crab, now the foods, including the crab are not as good as it use to be. The only time I dine here now is only for dim sum, not that it's the best in the city, but Sun ya Dim sum is not bad, sun ya had good parking, and Sun ya can accommodate quite a large group of people. and the chicken feet is tasty as well I am among the reviewers here who are surprised about the bad press on Yelp about this spot. This place is really not terrible, I mean it! The servers were attentive, informative and very friendly. The food was hot and even more importantly, fresh. We ordered shrimp ball wraps, shrimp cakes, eggplant, calamari and coconut filled pastries for dessert. The cashier/host was very nice and all in all I thought it was not bad being around 20 bucks for my friend and I. They have a bar in the back area that we didn't venture into and they also feature a private parking lot- which we didn't use as we were unaware of it. Maybe they changed owners or put us in the good seating or something, because I didn't notice it being gross or unclean in there whatsoever. The silverware, glasses, and table were decent and clean. Maybe they got a new manager. this place has two identities: you got the huge chinese banquet style with the huge round table and booths. then you got the other room: the bar lounge. i like em both but i guess i was a little more in love with the bar lounge. it felt so retro and has that dive feel where u can eat and not be bothered. i can get a drink, eat some good chinese food late at night, and watch tv? i'm a happy person.they've got some huge crabs there. i haven't tried them though. it's good chinese food, not amazing but your standard good. walnut shrimp, pork chops, egg dishes, noodles - yummy.and they have a parking lot! in chinatown with lack of parking this makes it so much more appealing. We went to Sun Ya's as a group of 12 during lunch, we ate dim sum off from the ample selection off of the carts. &#160;The service was very good, friendly and accommodating. All of the dishes (chow mien, fried rice, mongolian beef, prawns, wanton soup) were very good. I'm a fan of their baked hum bow. &#160;I bought a dozen there one morning while I was out on an errand it was cheap! &#160;$9.50 for a dozen and they were still warm. &#160;I like me a dozen hum bow. &#160;I also like me some cheap, delicious hum bow especially! &#160;Get some! Food is good and place is ratty. &#160;It's in Chinatown so what more can you expect. &#160;I was here for a special banquet and the service was nice, food was just okay and the place, well, needs a remodel. &#160;A funny thing that happens is the parking lot guy comes in and hollers out a license plate name like you are playing bingo. &#160;If your plate gets called, you get to move your car. &#160;That how they fit as many cars as they do in their tiny lot. &#160;At least they provide free parking. &#160;Not sure if I will go back but since we know the owner, it may happen. AWESOME! &#160;We've now eaten here 2x. &#160;Everyone loves it . . . i guess that's the highest praise. &#160;That includes my kids, my brother and his kids, and my parents. &#160;The nor mai gai are super duper awesome, the siu mai wonderful, my youngest son ate about 100 hargow. &#160;awesome. &#160;everything is hot, fresh and delicious. &#160;they brought me my oolong tea, and everything else we wanted. &#160;2 types of hot sauce. &#160;what more can i say? &#160;also, the super old maitre d' is a good host as well. I used to want to give this place 1-2 stars... because their Chinese food is overly americanized for my taste. &#160;However, after trying it again this weekend I'm giving this place a little more credit, 'cause the King Crabs were really good and affordable! At less than $10 a pound it's probably the cheapest in Chinatown area, and they cook it in several ways, steamed, fried, garlic... Oh, and you gotta try the alligator soup, taste like chicken :) 3 stars for free parking and the big crabs. This is the best dim sum in the International District, hands down. My husband, mother-in-law and I have gone to every other restaurant down there over the years, and Sun Ya is consistently the best. We just had it this morning, in fact.One thing I do recommend; get there between 10:30 and 11, otherwise there's no parking. Wow - this place sure has acquired some bad reviews here. I can't really fathom why. I have eaten here many times, and have never had a bad experience. The carts are always numerous, it is always busy and the food is always decent. Some of my families faves are the congee, the fried calamari with diced jalapeno, the chinese broccoli with oyster sauce and the steamed shrimp rolls. &#160;Is it the best? No, but it is certainly worth a try. The fact that it has parking in Chinatown is an added bonus.I must reply to some of the specific "complaints" form those who have given this place one star reviews:"There are too many white people": Really? Ignoring the fact that that borders on racist, it simply isn't true. In my experience, the vast majority of patrons are asian families, many conversing in various Chinese dialects."Sun Ya is infested with roaches": While I have never seen one there, I don't doubt that other people have. IT'S IN CHINATOWN. Every restaurant in Chinatown has roaches. And rats. Trust me.
Dinner here has certainly fared better than their disgusting Dim Sum. &#160; During dinner the seafood options are of good portion and the night time chef has done a good job with his/her presentation and thankfully the food is quite edible. &#160; That can't be said about their Dim Sum, which was ghastly different than not only their own dinner, but from the rest of the competition around them.The service has for the most part been decent, but nothing outstanding. &#160;In some sense they were lackadaisical, somewhat apathetic, but were still able to muster a smile while serving us. &#160;The Dim Sum dishes are of various varieties that extend from seafood to more traditional dishes found in other places. &#160;And with that said, it tasted like pure crap. &#160;The char siu sou was cardboard, the shrimp cheung fun was dry and sticky, tarot cake looked and tasted old, and the shumai was just disappointing. &#160;Run-ya from Sun-ya. i agree with nicole j. on the creepy-ness factor of the giant fish. &#160;but overall my experience was pleasant. &#160;birthday parties are usually fun though so it might have been that i wasn't paying much attention to the food OR decor while i was there. &#160;OR it might have been the bottle of champagne that i drank. &#160;hmmm... i'll have to sort that one out!we had a chinese banquet style meal complete with long life noodles. &#160;the food wasn't spectacular, but then again... chinese food in seattle? &#160;the service was polite and attentive and the private room that they had us in was nice and spacious. &#160;they even refilled my water glass three times without me asking! First off here are my Dim Sum Credentials: I'm pretty much 95% Chinese and have grown up in a Chinese household (Chinese part of me directly from Hong Kong) and have eaten Dim Sum in LA, NYC, Honolulu, San Fransisco, Guam, Tokyo, Paris, San Diego, Seattle, Bellevue, Spokane, and of course Hong Kong 10+ times. So take that for what it's worth. &#160;Anyway Sun Ya is what I'd rate somewhere between decent and good. &#160; &#160;Sun Ya has a wide variety of the essential Dim Sum, Ha Gao, Shumai, Chung Fun, La Ba Goa, Dofu Fa, etc. etc. The service is fast, and efficient. Chinese restaurants are not known for their "kiss your @$$ friendly service". The major up factor for Sun Ya though is the free parking and parking attendant that is there, and most people know that parking in Chinatown (I refuse to call it the International District) really sucks...especially on a Sunday for brunch. &#160; &#160;I've never been to Sun Ya for dinner, but i have ordered their Con-gee, Chow Fun, Mongolian Beef and it's good (same as most other decent Chinese places). Prices are fair. The only real down side to Sun Ya for me is..well it's not close living in Bellevue (and Top Gun and Noble Court have just as good parking/price/service/food). And I think Sun Ya uses much more MSG in their Dim Sum than other places...and you'll definitely feel it 30 minutes after you eat..so If you're very sensitive to MSG..stay away. Sun Ya is neither truly good or bad, if I'm craving Dim Sum in China Town you might find me there, mainly because of their parking. BTW for those who HAVE eaten at Sun Ya..does this sound familiar: "Key in Car, Okay?!?" and of course the ever so popular greeting at every Chinese restaurant in the world "How Many?!?"~Gp.s. Oh and if you're curious where I've had the best Dim Sum in my life...surprisingly it was a restaurant in Guam called Lotus Garden. It's no longer in business though because although the restaurant did great, the hotel it was in tanked...it was really sad to see Lotus Garden go. I've tried their dim sum one day for lunch with some co-workers. &#160;The table was super sticky and the dim sum was just OK, nothing seemed very fresh and some had an un-dim sum like smell to them. &#160;I have not been back nor do I think I will be. &#160;There are plenty other dim sum around.
Want extra protein? When I was younger, my family would come to Sun Ya quite often. Dim sum was cheap and they had parking. BUT after multiple bad experiences I vouch never to return, even if its change in management. Let me just tell you a bit of my horror stories from this place.1. Shrimp Dumplings (Ha Gao) smelled like trash (x2)They weren't using the freshest ingredients. Tore open a Ha Gao and &#160;I swear I smelled rotten garbage. They kindly exchanged the stinky one for a more decent one. But during another encounter at a different time with the same outcome, it really made it a final no.2. I was there for a wedding reception. While I was eating, I see a cockroach on the table scurrying away. A COCKROACH on the TABLE!!!! We know what that means, if you have one you're bound to have millions.Some facts about cockroaches from http://Wikipedia.com:"The cockroach is also one of the hardiest insects on the planet, capable of living for a month without food and remaining alive headless for up to a week. It can also hold its breath for 45 minutes and has the ability to slow down its heart rate." GROSS.I've seen some reviewers comment about the service on how great they are and how uncrowded it is... I wonder why. If you don't mind finding extra protein in your food, check this place out. &#160;As for me, I'm staying AWAY from here. &#160;Tip for GOOD Chinese food: Crowded restaurants, lines out the door, bad service because they are understaffed and a quick observation of the patrons who are eating (more Chinese people than any other ethnic group). You're definitely in great hands for some good Chinese food. Just be patient...
We stopped here for the Chinatown Food Walk - I had the BBQ pork side dish, while my friends had the Cantonese Steamed Chicken. &#160;The BBQ pork was good (not Kau Kau great, but who can be?) &#160;However, the steamed chicken was awesome - just like how my mom makes it. &#160;That and everything is pretty crazy cheap. &#160;I'll give a more thorough review when I come back, but I'm definitely coming back.
Dear Kaosamai, &#160;You did so well in the remodeling: &#160;very big and spacious indoor eating space, the kitchen looks pretty nice and big too. &#160;The deck is bigger than before. &#160;The building has a better color now. &#160;And in Fremont, a rare find: there's tons of parking...BUT! &#160;you get 2 stars from me today, because as I stated in my October 2009 review, you let the dogs pee on the deck. &#160;I thought MAYBE, just maybe, with the brand-spankin-new deck, you wouldn't let the ankle biters out there to do their business...But I was wrong! &#160;So wrong!Today, while enjoying my delicious food (it's true, the food is good), I noticed a turd on the deck, about 2 feet from where I was sitting. &#160;And it had been stepped in, dried up, and kicked into pieces on the deck!I'm sorry to say it, I don't care how good the food is, I can't eat at your establishment anymore. I had the best Phad Prik King at Kaosamai. It was super flavorful and the shrimp tasted really fresh. In other Thai restaurants I've been to around the area, they use frozen or precooked shrimp, which lacks that fresh sweetness. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and the aromatics in the Phad Prik King made the dish stand out from other Thai restaurants. The Red Curry was exceptionally delicious as well and I highly recommend it; however, I was disappointed by Kaosamai's Phad See Ew. It was lackluster and bland. The sauce and seasoning was just not right. Phad See Ew is my go-to dish at a Thai restaurant so this was really upsetting, but the awesome Phad Prik King and Red Curry will definitely make me return to Kaosamai. The Thai Iced Tea is also really tasty. The service was really nice and the space is very large and good for big groups. PROS:1. Delivered food in 30 minutes when it said it would arrive in 45 minutes to an hour.2. Free (? Might have just screwed up our order) mini spring rolls! Ten of them!CONS:1. Basil fried rice was bland. Tasteless. I usually ask for 1 star spiciness so I can taste the other (assumed) spices/flavors. Nada.2. Fried rice was not fried. It was pretty much regular rice tossed in oil. No yummy crunchy-hardened-by-the-frying-pan feel.3. Frozen veggies. Really? Liked they used Lucerne frozen veggie mix (carrots, peas, green beans, lima beans, corn). By veggie, I assumed freshly cut, chunky veggies. Not the frozen stuff.There is better Thai food in Seattle. Craving Thai food right around dinner time led us to Kaosamai one evening. Their extensive menu took me awhile to get through but after deciding that I definitely wanted a curry led me to their pumpkin curry. I remembered having something similar in San Francisco so I wanted to see if it was anything like its California counterpart. The sauce was super creamy with the right amount of spice. The pumpkin was perfectly cooked and after every bite I wanted more. Next time I order the food here I will make sure that I don't add a meat and just ask for extra pumpkin as it was definitely the highlight of the evening's menu. Come here and make sure you try it...it is delicious if you are a pumpkin fan! I work with a bunch of Thai food junkies and of all the places we've tried in the Fremont area this is certainly our favorite. Very reasonable prices and ginormous portion sizes. Expect to get at least 2 meals from one entree. We all really love the pa nang curry lunch combo. I have also had the red curry and some of the &#160;soups - all of which were delicious. They offer free delivery in the evenings in the Fremont area.Heads up: The website that is up right now is not updated so when you call to order don't just give them the #. Hopefully they get that taken care of asap. I have been hunting around good Phad Thai. I have been having a hard time so when TIPPR has a deal a $20 voucher for Kaosamai I thought I'd give it a shot. We started with the regular spring rolls. For entrees we had the Phad Thai and the Pumpkin Curry dish with a side of Jasmine Rice. I liked the size of the spring rolls. They are about half the size of normal ones but you get like ten of them. The filling was good. My only criticism is that the shell was rather thick and overcooked. The Phad Thai, while different than any of the last three places I have been to, which I found had too heavy of a fishiness to them, was instead more on the bland side. The pumpkin curry delicious. The pieces of Thai pumpkin along with the tofu, basil and bell peppers was delicious. I was actually really impressed with the tofu, which silky, soft and delicious.With so many other Thai places in Seattle to try I am not sure that this will be back on my list any time soon. Show me a place with outstanding Phad Thai and I will be there. My friend and I just finished drinking at the Sin and Saints across the street. It's time for dinner and we were actually recommended to come here by locals. We don't regret it. I ordered the Garlic Noodle Soup, which was totally tasty and felt like home-made. A very good noodle soup, great price, and great place! I love this place. &#160;The owners are wonderful - the food is delish and the service is consistently great. &#160;After eating there at least once a month for &#160;many years my husband and I decided to use them as the caterer for our wedding. &#160;It's been about a year since our big day and we STILL get compliments from friends and family on how great our food was. &#160;There's a joke that Fremont is actually the Swedish word for thai restaurant because there are so many to choose from- skip the rest and go here- it is the best! Kaosamai serves up the best Thai food in Seattle. &#160;The panang curry is my favorite entree, and the Giow Tawt crab appetitzer is amazing. Of course the Pad Thai (a standard measurement tool for assessing Thai restaurants) is rich, and flavorful, and they are not afraid to add the spice (if you ask for it). &#160;They have a beautiful large outdoor deck and nice clean interior. &#160;The staff is always very nice. &#160;They catered out wedding and did an amazing job. &#160;The guests raved about the food, even my non-adventurous relatives from the midwest! &#160;Many of our more 'traditional eaters' who had never had tofu became fried tofu converts saying they simply hadn't known it could be so good. Couldn't recommend it higher. One of my favorite places for lunch, yum and very affordable! Absolutely my favorite thai food in Seattle. Which is saying something - there is a ton and a half of pad thai noodles on the wok in Seattle as I type (i'm sure...).Kaosamai just seems to have a little something extra - first of all they're always super prompt (arrive at the quoted pickup time and the food is ready and waiting) and their sauce/preparation is better than anywhere else I've tried.My boyfriend and I usually stick to our regular dishes (Pad Kee Mao and Pad See Ew) and they are FABULOUS here.Only complaint: A little out of the way (15-20 minute drive from our capitol hill location) but TOTALLY WORTH THE TIME! I've always loved this place, but just ordered $70 in delivery food, and I couldn't eat any of it. If you're a vegetarian, beware. There is heavy fish sauce in even the tofu and vegetable dishes. Either I missed this detail before and have become more sensitive to it, or they've recently added this to all their dishes (or added more than in the past?). Whatever the case, I'm switching to the vegetarian Thai Place in Ballard, Jhanjay. But if you're not a vegetarian, Kaosamai is great.
This is my favorite Thai restaurant. &#160;I've tried some other places where the food seems to have been sitting around for awhile in grease. &#160;But every time I get food from Kaosamai, it's delicious! &#160;It somehow seems healthier too, maybe because of the fact that they use less oil or something. &#160;My favorite menu item is the fresh spring rolls with prawns. &#160;They are so delicious! &#160;They come with a peanut dipping sauce that is delectable. &#160;I also love the pineapple curry and the cashew chicken entree. &#160;They also offer brown rice which I usually get, and they DELIVER! &#160;So awesome! &#160;There's a nice deck at the actual restaurant which is nice in the summer. they deliver. This is what drew me to Kaosamai. It surely wasn't the dearth of Thai restaurants here in little Bangkok, aka Fremont.It also wasn't the peach colored house with the chain link fence around the deck that drew me in. Once I found their website, http://kaosamai.com, I looked over the menu- pretty standard thai fare- I decided on my standard order- pad see ew and spring rolls. The cutie who arrived at my door within half an hour (Don't count on this, I just live around the corner (I know, how lazy??) ) handed me my food and smiled wide. &#160;He knew his goods were, well, good.WOW. Delicious, full of flavor, not too greasy, fresh and abundant veggies and tofu in the noodles! Some places use the broccoli as a garnish, rather than as a feature of the dish, and I love broccoli and want lots of it! There was plenty. The food was hot, relatively cheap, and the dishes were HUGE! Definitely leftovers for lunch the next day.Kaosamai gets my vote as my second favorite thai restaurant, second only to Kwanjai, who has my loyalty from nine years of living around the corner from them. another good one
A friend and I stopped into Kaosamai for lunch and a chat on a Saturday. As we approached I became a little leery noting the empty tables, but quickly recovered when I saw a "People love us on Yelp" sticker on the front door.My friend ordered an appetizer and the black sticky rice, while I asked for the phad see iew. We received our platters lickety-split, and were pleased with the food, which appeared and tasted fresh. &#160;The service was quick, polite, and pleasant. The total for two lunches, no beverages, was ~$23. I'm living the life of a pauper these days, so prefer not to spend over $10 on a lunch, but my friends are worth it. I love this place. The food is always fresh, I've enjoyed the friendliness and above and beyondedness of the staff. Once, I asked for mint tea with no caffeine and the lady said *they* didn't have any but she had some herself she'd be happy to give me. I gladly took an unopened bag of Tazo Refresh tea from her and thanked her. Its rare to find folks this hospitable. Yay! 10 bonus points for that.I order the battered prawns and the Phad See Ewe, as well as fresh prawn rolls, while friends order Phad Thai (who woulda thunk it). All seem pretty good, especially the stuff I order. It can get busy at this place during certain evenings and times, but its not too hard to get in on short notice.I'll be back again and again and I'll like it! We love Kaosamai (as they say on the menu, "pronounced Gao sa mai"). They've been our go-to Thai place in the neighborhood since we moved to Fremont - and even after we moved further up the hill to Greenwood, it's still our top Thai in the neighborhood!Their Yellow Curry with Chicken is unstoppable, and their Spring Rolls are super crispy and tasty. Great service, great food. And summers on the patio are quite nice. My roommate and I were feeling hungry and lazy. &#160;Kaosamai is right down the street from our apartment and we happened to have a takeout menu so clearly it was the easiest option.I got the green curry - super delicious! &#160;The coconut milk is very creamy and the bamboo adds a nice texture. &#160;The other vegetables in the dish - peppers, eggplant - were a little undercooked for my tastes but the tofu....like silk! &#160;The whole leaves of sweet basil were a nice touch as well.My roommate got the yellow curry (after reading all the high ratings of it on yelp) and ate most of it within two minutes. &#160;I think she enjoyed it. &#160;Service was fast and friendly - 15 minutes from phone call to pickup - and local delivery is free. (I think I'd be too embarrassed to have them deliver two blocks away. &#160;Probably I'll get over that real quick though.) I've had a couple of good experiences here. &#160;On the most recent visit, we ordered the tofu pad thai and the chicken pumpkin curry. &#160;The pad thai was ok - though flavorful and full of vegetables, I found the noodles a little mushy and in need of extra lime. &#160;The pumpkin curry was really good, medium spice like we requested, with plenty of chunks of pumpkin and slices of tender white meat chicken.Service was really good and very quick. &#160;They weren't very busy so we had no trouble getting refills. &#160;Nice, relaxing, and quiet place to get a quick meal. The last time the husband and I dined at Kwanjai, it was three years ago after we first moved to Fremont and were narrowing down what would become our regular spots. We never went back.Yesterday evening, our neighbors treated us to Kwanjai Thai delivery. They love this place and were introduced by friends who also rave about it. I had the Phad See Iew which was okay: noodles, tofu, carrots, broccoli, egg, and cabbage. The cabbage threw me. I prefer my phad see iew without cabbage. Also I like my food spicy so was surprised when three stars ended up tasting like cabbage. And afterwards I remember feeling like I had just eaten a bunch of cabbage. I dunno, I'm just not a fan of cabbage in my phad see iew. But maybe everyone else is?However the big plus of this place is that they actually deliver. I'll probably try them again and ask them to hold the cabbage. I could have done that to begin with but then I couldn't spend a whole review talking about cabbage. Took a recommendation from my brother and future sister-in-law. They fell in love with this place, and will be serving it at their wedding. Kaosamai was delicious! The atmosphere was homey and friendly. I had the pad thai. Everything was very fresh, tasty and very affordable.
ahh! I wondered what this space had turned into, I always see people leaving but never understood what it was. Now I'll have to try it and let you know. Thanks for sharing the secret! Great food with interesting and tasty drinks. This hidden away gem seemed to be an outstanding watering hole, but surprised me with their delicious food and unique atmosphere. I recommend calling ahead for seating though as the place is very small. We went when they opened and still had to sit at the bar. This place is definitely worth checking out though. I'd recommend the pretzel with the beer cheese to start. Simple, yet delicious! One of my favorite watering holes, the bartenders are awesome, particularly Greg. &#160;The Gin and Ginger is a must try. &#160;My last visit was so-so (for the first time) or else it would get 5 stars. Everything everyone else has said on Yelp about this place is correct: this place is rad. Truthfully, in the end it's still just a bar... But it is cozy and staffed with nice people; drinks are stiff; food is yummy; and you get the bonus secret entry beginning to your night to create a nice story to tell your friends. I would go back again and again. Our visit started off a bit shaky with a misunderstanding about my friend's reservation, but the real test of any business is how they handle mistakes. &#160;In this case, Knee High more than exceeded my expectations. &#160;They quickly sorted out the problem, found a spot for our group, and gave us the first round of drinks on them. &#160;The staff was friendly and from what I could tell had great drinks that everyone loved. &#160;I am looking forward to more events at Knee High Stocking Co. Umm love this place. &#160;Staff are charming and they know their bevvies! &#160;Had three of the best cocktails I'v ever had at this spot. &#160;Highly recommend. I've got to say, this is my favorite spot in all of Seattle. The drinks are phenomenal, the prices are reasonable (especially at happy hour) and the atmosphere is laid back. For such a sweet little spot in the speakeasy style that Seattle has fallen in love with, it is completely un-pretentious and cozy! All the bartenders know their stuff, Greg is the BEST! Go for the Gin and Ginger or one of their awesome absinth cocktails... you can't loose. It's tiny in there, but if you go on a weeknight or early in the evening, you'll get excellent attention. Both times I've been, it was crowded -- but that adds to the appeal. &#160;It is exclusive, and you have to ring the doorbell, and it is exciting to get in. &#160;The bartender Greg rocks my socks. &#160;I really like him.The mac n cheese was great, but that's the only food I've had there. &#160;I'd like to try more. &#160;I look forward to going back there! Recently I've been on a real "only new or tried-and-true" kick with restaurants &amp; bars and was scoping new spots on yelp when I discovered knee high stocking company and thought I would give it a go.I have to admit I was a little afraid to ring the doorbell, I guess I just felt like maybe I would have to show a badge of coolness upon entry but the waitress was actually welcoming and quick to greet us at the door as well as answer any of our questions about the menu. We had some tapas, the happy hour punch, wine, and some classic cocktails before our party eventually came to meet us. This place is made for a calm evening out with rad company &amp; conversation. When we finally asked for the check I realized we had been there for 3 1/2 hours!! Our server informed me that the house had comped some drinks for us (granted, we ordered food, 3 hours worth of drinks and brought a large party to their establishment on a weekday evening) but I wouldn't have thought twice about the bill devoid of any special discounts. I have to say though, I was pretty impressed, not all establishments realize the opportunity to be had in wooing their patrons and showing them that their business is genuinely appreciated. A couple comped drinks easily translates into endless positive-word-of-mouth, lifetime customers, and fatty tips. Knee High Stocking Co. has certainly earned my repeat business... My wife and I really enjoyed the Knee High Stocking Co. &#160;We loved the mysterious vibe with the text message reservations and the secret "ring the doorbell" entry. &#160;The drinks were tasty and our server Sarah was excellent and made great recommendations on our drinks and food. &#160;The atmosphere is fun, special and intimate. &#160;We will definitely come back again and try Sarah's other recommendations. I went here awhile back with my friend Christine to try it out since we were on Capitol Hill. I had two drinks, one was something similar to an Old Fashioned and the other was a Knee High Gin &amp; Ginger. Both were spot on in regards to what a cocktail should be. I also had their Mac &amp; Four Cheeses which was really excellent. Don't plan on it being a huge bowl though, this place is built much more around the ideas of presentation and taste. If I lived in Seattle still I would go here more often. This place is adorable! I like the idea of texting in your reservation and the pseudo hush-hush attitude that they have (no cameras or cell phones allowed inside! But they didn't seem to actually have a problem with this). Our server was friendly and personable and made us feel very comfortable as if we were regulars. She made fantastic drink recommendations (she brought me a St. James cooler and actually made me like whiskey for a night!) and kept checking back to make sure that everything was going alright. Only thing is that this place is pretty small-- probably fits 30-35 people and that'd be pushing it... so text your reservations in and hurry on down! Even though everyone already knows about this speakeasy, I think it's still worth stopping here for a mid-week drink. &#160;I've never been there on the weekend, but if you hit it on a Wednesday or Thursday evening, you will still be able to get a seat despite the very limited room. &#160;The food is fairly tasty, but nothing to write home about. As for the experience, which is one of the main reasons for going to a speakeasy, I found it to be very welcoming and friendly. &#160;The hostess and bartender were engaging and seemed genuinely interested in making sure my group had a good time and enjoyed our food and drinks. &#160;While I probably won't become a regular, I would say this place is worth ringing the doorbell at least once. having an absinthe &amp; eating a pretzel @ 12 in the morning, need i say more? i also like that i don't run into half of capitol hill when i go here, it's a nice little spot that makes some killer drinks, if only it were a tad bigger. other than that, woo-hoo! What a great find! This tricky to find speakeasy seems to have taken an undeserved backseat to Tavern Law; the ambiance is more intimate and casual and the food options are much more appealing. The classic cocktails are made to perfection and they food options are really good -- lamb sliders and chicken pot pie are seriously good. Can't wait to go back and try some of the other yummy sounding options. Great, and very interesting drinks! Been a while since I saw a selection of Absinthes in a drinks menu card. Dishes were perfectly sized and all delicious. Ambiance awesome, staff sweet too. I'll definitely be back again and again. there's something about going somewhere secretive. based on all the reviews, this place is not all that secretive yet gives you the allure that you stepped into a time in history of prohibition, and basically another drinking experience. this experience is a little different from your usual bars. first, no sign. just look for the blue door and ring the door bell. they'll open the door and see if they can seat you. second, read the extensive menu. they've got house rules which i find endearing cuz it is encouraging you to speak easy and drink easy. no need to rush your drinks but just relax, choose wisely, and sip. i would recommend this place for a date or with one other friend. not so group friendly. and be willing to be flexible. i did have to play musical chairs and was moved around to accommodate bigger groups. but as the night went on i had to sit at the bar where it was meant to be! that is where i got to see all the magic! i like seeing bartenders using fresh ingredients, weird concoctions, and even a cool slow water filter that drips the water one drip at a time to hit the absinthe. i learned a lot that night. what i remember is another story I love this place. I really do. The food is comforting, the daily punch (served from 6-8 during happy hour) rocks my world and the bartenders (like Heather) are amazing. Plus, I like that I can text them for a reservation. It is a small place so I recommend doing this, even if you're just stopping by for a drink. Don't disobey any of the unwritten house rules, or these chicks will break it &#160;D O W N &#160;for you. Please stop ordering me around, little girl. I'm here to drink with my friends, spend some money, and leave a little something for you if you earn it. You're here to make sure I have the best time possible -- hence your title of SERVER. &#160;End of story.As the great Nina Simone once crooned, "Don't tell me, I'll tell YOU. This situation's just about through."Great cocktails though! Super cool place. Very small, but super cool. We stood out in the rain at the beginning after we rang the doorbell once. It was kind of annoying but well worth it and it actually added to the allure of "sneaking" into a bar like people had to do in the 1920s during Prohibition.A+! Hot and sexy! That's what I call this place. Absolutely delicious dishes from chicken pot pie to macaroni and cheese to lamb sliders to soft pretzels with rarebit. Nom, nom, nom... A plethora of signature cocktails and the drink designer (not bartender, I guess) will even create one special just for you, based on your specific taste. How user-friendly is that? Sexy space, super secret way to get in (ring the nondescript doorbell), savvy drink and food specialists. What's not to love? Plus, the cook was taunting the drink lady with a lamb slider until she finally gave in! He made the lamb slider say, "Please eat me, I am so scrumptious." I can't believe it took her so long to cave. I had half a mind to grab it myself:) You absolutely must go! Wow! This place is wonderful. Their drinks are so unique, so tasty, and they compliment the delicious food perfectly. We showed up around 7:00. We each ordered a glass of punch. Both glasses were refreshing and delicious, and started the evening off perfectly. Since we were hungry, we decided to get some food. I ordered the cheese plate, she ordered the pretzel. Yum, I haven't had better appetizer food in my life. Perhaps I'm sheltered and haven't had a lot of "appetizer food," and therefore don't know what I'm talking about (yeah, perhaps...but I really don't think that's the case here). Or perhaps this is as good as it gets. I don't know that I can say for sure, but I will say that I was so satisfied and happy with what I ate! For drinks, the girlfriend had a Gin &amp; Ginger (I drank a sip or two, and trust me, it was delicious) and I had a Gin Swizzle (I drank it all, and trust me, it was delicious). &#160;After finishing our food &amp; drink we thought we'd split just one more drink. After a lot of thought, we decided on the Moscow Mule. Once again, delicious. I like drinking, I like eating, I admit it. But this place blew me away. I can't say enough good things about it. The atmosphere is great, the service is great, the food is great, the drinks are great. This place is wonderful. I hope it continues to do well. I've never intended to be a "regular" anywhere. But I can honestly say I definitely want to be one here. A million thumbs, way, way up! Knee High has dessert finally!!!!!! We went into to knee high last night for a couple of drinks and snacks and as always the food, drinks and service was great. In the past we always wish they offered a few sweet treats and now they have pie - - amazing pie!!! The apple caramel pie was soooo good! I guess they are made by a local baker who is a pie genius!!! I just had drinks here with a friend on Tuesday night. &#160;Definitely text ahead for reservations - it was pretty crowded. &#160;Servers and hostess were busy, but very friendly and speedy. &#160;The cocktails were to die for (The Grasshopper was like drinking boozy, boozy candy) and reasonably priced (generally under $10). &#160;I like that they display the price of the cocktails up front on the menu. &#160;Current seasonal cocktails are available on the website, if you're trying to strategize. &#160;I'll definitely come back here and bring a date. Ahhh... I think I'm in love. This placewas fabulous. Went there on a midweek evening and it was not uber busy at all, granted it took me forever to find parking, but hey that's Seattle. The waitress was super nice, sad I didn't catch her name, but she was great.We got the salted nuts (yum..) and lumpia (really yum), I ordered the grape-beri knee high, and the friend ordered &#160;the between the sheets. Friend's drink was stroooong. I'm a weakling. My drink was strong too, but oh-so-good. Will definitely come back and try other drinks, the service was superb! The drinks are unique,Heather will knock your socks off.Will come again soon.Great drinks, nice atmosphere. The bartender, Heather, was friendly, funny, and talented at her art. My friends and I sat at the bar and enjoyed both her drinks and our interactions. The food was pretty good (ooh, the nuts are pretty deelish) though we only had snacks and small appetizers. For drinks, try Aviation - YUM! I love the drinks at Knee High, and the atmosphere. The waiters are generally good-to-great, though I've seen them understaffed a few times, and a bit stressy &amp; forgetful. Sometimes the food has come cold, or is a bit sporadic - the mac and cheese, especially, varies highly depending on who is in the kitchen that night. I do enjoy all the items they put on the menu, though. The only other bad thing I can possibly say about Knee High is that the menu could use about 5 or 6 more items on it, for variety's sake. Maybe a salad, guys? Or at least, something vegetable-y without being mashed potatoes?However, I go here generally twice or more a month. I love the selection of strange liqueurs and interesting concoctions. As a bourbon-hater, I have even found a brown-liquor based drink or two on the menu that I enjoy, and all of the bartenders are willing to make something off-the-fly if you request. This place is great for drinks. I also love the text-based reservations system. It's so bizarre, yet works great. Atmosphere is cool both at the bar and in a booth. It takes reservations but they can find room for you. I've been there twice with a decent size group but got there no later than 10 p.m. Food: the mac and cheese, potatoes, lamb burgers are quite tasty. Stop #2 on the E Olive Way Crawl... and we probably should have called ahead. &#160;HOWEVER, they were great and let our group of 8 in for our one obligatory drink. &#160;They were a bit pushy on getting us out of there quickly, but most of us understood why. &#160;I say most because some in the group felt they were a bit 'snotty'. We came back a few weekends ago with a smaller group specifically for the punch. I loved that I could make my reservation via text message BTW. Awesome and efficient. Everyone was very nice, but we all felt the punch was a bit small. An okay value for $3, but not spectacular. &#160;We'll be back to try food someday though. The pretzels looked damn good. Knee High Stocking Co. gets me knee high in cocktails every time I go.This place is probably one of the best places to not only get a good drink, but have a load of fun with the staff. &#160;The place is perched on the corner of Olive Way and E Olive Pl, with nothing more than a dimly lit doorbell and a small set of stickers spelling Knee High Stocking Co. &#160;The first time I went, I rang the doorbell, and was sadly turned away, as they were packed for the rest of that Friday night. &#160;The second time I went, I took the doorwoman's suggestion and texted in a reservation. &#160;As strange as that sounds, they tend to text you back in less than an hours time, and usually with good news. &#160;If you're going on a Friday or Saturday night, I highly recommend texting in a reservation. &#160;You can also text in changes to your reservation if you're going to be late or if there's a change in your party. &#160;Pretty sweet system in my opinion. &#160;From my second visit on, I was hooked.The inside is a little dark, but not so dark as to make it unbearable. &#160;It actually makes it quite nice. &#160;There are mostly table seats, but snatch a seat at the bar if you can. &#160;Every bartender I've had the pleasure of meeting and talking to here has been extremely friendly, and downright hilarious. &#160;To be frank, the bar seat experience is what makes this place so awesome. &#160;And don't tell anyone, but I might have been fed a few other drinks by the bartender's hand via cocktail tasting straws. &#160;Things got intimate, and weird, and awesome, and awkward at the end of the night.Overall, the drinks themselves are very good. &#160;I've had better versions of some of the cocktails, but there were great versions of some of their other cocktails. &#160;First things first, the Gin &amp; Ginger is not as good as I was hoping it to be. &#160;It's a bit watered down and doesn't have the punch of ginger I was hoping for. &#160;The standouts for me were the Sazerac, the Pimm's Italiana, and the Hot Butter Rum. &#160;All three had a perfect blend of alcohol, and didn't have the same taste of water that several of the other cocktails had. &#160;The Pimm's Cup might have benefited from a little more gin, a little less Pimm's, and a little more crushed cucumber, but the drink was still great. &#160;On the sweeter side of things, the Blood and Sand and Flor were extremely refreshing. &#160;From the kitchen, I had the Mac &amp; 4 Cheese, Broccoli and Mash, Chicken Pot Pie, and Lamb Mini-Burgers. &#160;Of the four, the Broccoli and Mash was the best. &#160;It has a nice, smooth creamy texture with the perfect amount of broccoli. &#160;The Mac &amp; 4 Cheese was a bit heavy, but also delicious. &#160;The Chicken Pot Pie comes out pie-ping hot, but taste-wise is a bit lacking. &#160;The pie crust is awesome, but the inside tastes a little bit pre-made. &#160;The Lamb Mini-Burgers could have been really good, but I think they were overcooked and lacked any form of seasoning. &#160;In any case, I don't think most people come here for the food.Knee High Stocking Co. is a guaranteed night of fun that'll have you running around in knee high stockings by the end of the night.GET: &#160;Sazerac No, thanks.Waited outside in the cold in a skirt with my friend Brian (not in a skirt), got denied and had to wait for a text message to come back. I was willing. Heck, It's better than sitting in a waiting room, to go somewhere else for a drink in the meantime.Well, i wish i hadn't left the Buck where we waited. Knee High's food makes my Kate Moss-sized paycheck weep, but my not-so-Kate Moss-sized buttocks weep even more, and when the flustered/friendly/clueless (cocktail-wise, not in a stupid way) waitress asked what i wanted, i found nothing on the menu that matched my tastes.The drink menu is one of those fancy Bibles that have too much fluff but nothing i like. i asked for something along the lines of a bloody mary and a martini. You know...something briny, salty, spicy, savory....not sweet. Not infused with berry whatever. She said the bartenders would have "just the thing".What she brought me tasted like a melted Red Hot Candy. Hot in that gross, sweet, cinnamon way. That is nothing like a martini/bloody mary. I wasn't really sure where to go to find the source of this horrible elixir since the place was so damn dark and awkward, so i just kind of waited for it to be over. Someone else can have my seat.And we ate a pretzel. Fancy livin'!Really....you have to ring a doorbell for this? p.s, i love you Brian M., for taking me here! Don't be mad...i am happy we got to see some sexy legs in fishnets here! It's an interesting idea. Big tough bartender/door man. Hooch in a punchbowl. It was quiet when I was there: uncrowded, pleasant. I can see how on a busier night it would be a pain in the ass to make your way around.The food smelled good. I didn't eat any. Sweet little (and yes, I mean little - I felt like I was in my studio apartment) place. We rang the bell and waited and a nicely dressed woman came out and asked us if we had reservations and although we didn't (reservations for a bar?) she was super nice and told us she would text us when our table opened in about 30 minutes. When we got back we again rang the bell and were seated in the tiny dimly lit room and greeted by a waitress in a flapper dress. They had an extensive drink menu - pims, artichoke liqueur, apple jack, etc. Beware though - ordering off the menu will get you a personal visit from the bartender. At least that's what our waitress warned us. So we did as we were told and were quite pleased with our drinks.We also tried out some of their food items and the broccoli mashed taters were AMAZING! They played good tunes the whole time we were there spanning different era with the occasionally song being turned up for the entire crowd to sing to. What a hidden treasure! &#160;Have walked by this place a million times and never knew it was here.So my friend text in our reservation. &#160;When we got there we rang the bell and the waitress came outside &amp; asked us if we had a reservation. &#160;We did so she let us in. &#160;It was all very secretive and exciting!I had the spicy mac &amp; cheese &amp; a wine. &#160;The food was incredible, the drinks as well. &#160;My friend had the onion soup which she said was very oniony, she really liked it. &#160;Loads of onions. &#160;We will definitely be back! Kneehigh Stocking Company was the site of my Valentine's day gathering of Most Favored Dining Companion and Couple Who Moved to Seattle for the Hell of It (who I've known since high school). What a perfect place to comiserate with old friends while consuming excellently mixed drinks and nibbles. They have the trendy speakeasy vibe going on - you text them your reservations and ring the bell at the unmarked door. It's fun to feel like you're doing something that is a little verboten, but Kneehigh should try not to take it too far - it's not ACTUALLY prohibition anymore, so there's no need to scold when I take one picture of my friends. Following the '20s theme, the extensive drink menu is full of classics that are mixed to perfection - not too boozy, but definitely not watery, and not over-garnished or over-size. Just right. The small plates are sophisticated comfort food - we had some delicious mac n' cheese along with a cheese plate, olives, &#160;and lamb sliders for the carnivores among us. All was tastey, though if I hadn't been so drunk by the end of the night I probably would have been hungry about an hour later. Hopefully they can expand their menu, but I suspect they are limited by their kitchen size. The wine selection was also meager, but every choice was a good one. Love love love love!!!!!!!!!I can't tell you how much I adored my dining + drinking experience here!!!!! So I came here for a girls night out and decided to check out knee high stockings!!!! I am so happy that I did.You have to text the staff their with your reservations, and then get confirmed. If you were wondering where it is located. It's located where this pizza and pasta place was once located accross the way from saley, and winner's circle. So please be open your eyes to this place. Because if you don't, you'll miss it!So we went for happy hour without evening know it was happy hour, and we got their chicken pot pie ( yummy yummy ) their fingerling potatoes, which we dipped into our pot pie, and their mac and cheese!!!! So tasty!!!!!But the thing that topped it off, was their service! I swear it was by far the best service I have ever had in seattle! The two staff members were so friendly, and just on top of everything. Not too attentive, and not ignoring us. I loved it, and their cocktails were dangerous.... mostly their punch, and their shots that they were passing around!!! I must admit that I can not remember the rest of the night, but from what I remembered it was amazing! :)knee high stockings is the best!!!!!!!!!!!! I love you guys, and cannot wait to bring more people with me next time!!! The Knee High Stocking Co is a great place to find stockings and socks of all different types of fabrics and colors. I found some great stockings for my lady friend here that she loved the design and the smooth feel that I love too. Ok coast is clear....So your not a cop, right? Ok, if your cool ring the door bell and the door host will check yeah out..If everything is cool she'll/he'll find a table for you and your friends. When I got in it was busy. My colleagues and I got placed in a tight room in a corner with another party. But it was cool anyways. Everyone is very friendly. I don't drink...and Why would I come to a speak easy? We'll Their food menu sounds good but it was a near miss. I had their Mac'n cheese, Salted nuts, and some sweet potato wedges that were descent. People seemed to enjoy their drinks and if your adventurist ask for the bar tenders choice which Clevey the bar tender chooses the drink. Also the menu offers...the"Green Fairy" if your in the know. ..But keep the Knee High on the low. ..Uh &#160;hum-hum!....Yup Broadway is just up the hill and take a right to get to Dicks... Three of us decided to wander into Knee High on President's Day Monday for a quick drink around 6pm. We texted to check for availability and received a text encouraging us to come on over. We rang the doorbell to the locked undesignated entrance and were welcomed in to a beautiful small speakeasy-like bar. Although we seemed to be the first to arrive for the evening, we felt welcomed and passed the 9 tables to have a seat at the bar. The bartender was friendly and gave us time to review the menu. Instead of selecting one of the many enticing drinks, I asked the bartender to make me something with St. Germain and vodka. He added some gin, carefully kissed the rim of my glass with lemon peel and served me a fabulous drink! Also, I highly recommend the Blue Moon, which includes Violette amongst its liqueurs. We also ordered 3 dishes, all of which were delectable and reminded me of the neighborhood bars I used to frequent in Queen Village (Philadelphia). We had Fingerling Potato Oven Fries Roasted with Coriander Ketchup, Mac &amp; 4 Cheese with Smoked Cheddar, Gruyere, Parmesan, and Blue Cheese in a homemade b&#233;chamel sauce with a tantalizing spicy finish, and Lamb Mini-Burgers, fresh ground lamb topped with house-made Mango Chutney. All of it was worth trying.Although some might argue that the concept is gimmicky and exclusive, I would say that it is an experience and that it is a place that celebrates the art of good drinks, food, and hospitality with less pretense than one would anticipate.This is the kind of place to go to if you want to truly enjoy your drink. There is so much detail in the choice of liquor and the preparation, that you are sure to enjoy it! Excellent concept (ring door bell to get in - speakeasy style), very cozy, great bartender, nice ambience. All-in all great bar to hang out with friends..Only con is : place is too small &amp; hard to get in for groups bigger than 8...Weekends are generally packed, so for first timers, i suggest going on a weekday. I feel very hip, having been here. &#160;Easy to miss location, no sign, but address is visible from the street. &#160;Ring to doorbell to get in. &#160;Inside, a petite speakeasy style bar awaits. &#160;We had a little group happy hour here - be sure to make a reservation for a group, it is a small place. &#160;Luscious and delightfully tendered cocktails were served, along side tempting and tasty small plates. &#160;I do wish there had been three of the mini lamb burgers instead of just two per serving. &#160;They also had some very precious gourmet hand cut fingerling potato french fries. &#160;I also recommend trying the roasted cauliflower - mmmmm, yummy. &#160; I think this is a fantastic place to stop in on a pub crawl. Having never been to a speakeasy I thought this was going to be a cool secretive club. The whole process of texting the number for a reservation and ringing the door bell was interesting and mysterious.When we entered we took our seats at a corner room. Drinks and food were served. The mac n cheese was pretty good, but the double shot of Ab tasted like Black liquorice.Anyhow, I came more for the experience than the drinks. And compared to the other speakeasy I went to that night, this just seemed like a regular lounge except we had a room to ourselves. We could still hear people talking loudly outside and a couple stumbled into our room to chat, which also killed the experience.Sorry, but it was hard to speak good about this speakeasy... What a great way to start and end my short 6 days in Seattle. I had an absolute blast belting out songs from the hostess's playlist, soaking in the warm environment and conversations around me, while indulging in some finely mixed cocktails made by Gregg with 2 G's. Sitting at the bar is key to a good time. Thurs/Fri/Sat are probably the best nights, but I imagine there would be a slight wait. Different nights definitely bring a different vibe. We were lucky and landed bar seats both nights that we were there. The Toast had quite a time there, and paid for it two hours later. :/ We don't blame Knee High though. ;)Also the pretzels and dipping sauce are bomb! YUM.Oh and we totally met a Seattle version of Ligaya. WHOA. We went here Friday night. &#160;The people are all so warm and gracious and it made us feel welcome and comfortable even though we were running a little late and nearly had to give up our table. &#160;The bar has a great feel and high quality drinks and food. &#160;He had the chicken pot pie and I had broccoli mashed potatoes. &#160;Moscow Mules were great.I definately want to go back for happy hour and try the punch. &#160;Don't know what it is, but I have full confidence in the bar.This place is tiny but they manage it well with their text message reservation system. &#160;Looks like a great place for a private party as well. My journey on the Seattle cocktail movement continues...I don't give 5 stars very often - I'm happy to say &#160;this one's well deserved.What a cool little joint! &#160;I'd been wanting to check out KHSC ever since I'd read about it in a magazine a month or so ago. &#160;Pretty much lived up to all of the expectations that I had for it - and then surpassed them. &#160;Granted, my friend and I were here on a Sunday night - so that might have added to the accessibility of this place - but I thought it was great. &#160;Not sure about the hater reviews on here - didn't get that experience at all. &#160;It's a good thing that there are some pictures here on Yelp to help you find it. &#160;Otherwise, it would have been pretty easy to have missed this little gem. &#160;But then, in the spirit of being a 'speakeasy' maybe that's intentional (?). &#160;Once you find it however, ring the doorbell and a cozy little sanctuary awaits.We stopped by without reservations, or having placed a text. &#160;Wasn't a problem. &#160;Just rang the doorbell and moments later were whisked through the black curtain and back in time. &#160;The drink menu here is a work of art. &#160;Probably 40 or so drinks here that I've never even heard of. &#160;And nice little food menu to boot. &#160;Our Bartender/Server Heather was awesome! &#160;So friendly, helpful and pleasant. &#160;Did I mention knowledgeable? &#160;She was good enough to give us some lessons on the fine arts of mixology and pre-prohibition drinks 101. &#160;Learned more about the fine art that goes into cocktail making when you're a connoisseur of 'spirits' and not just someone looking to suck down a rum n' coke at the local bar. &#160;Did you know that this place carries 7 different kinds of Absinthe? &#160;Did you know that there even ARE 7 different kinds of Absinthe? &#160;I didn't... &#160;Kudos to Heather - she made our whole experience just that much more fun!I love the Knee High. &#160;I love that it's hard to find. &#160;And I love that the people running it truly love what they do. &#160;Makes for a wonderful experience all around. &#160;If you can't get in on your first try, come back, it's definitely a little cove of mahogany delight that's worth coming back for. &#160;I know I will. *yawwwwn*Ringing the infamous door-buzz button is awkward since it just adds hype to where it can't measure up. &#160;I think the only saving grace is the protection of the speakeasy. &#160;Definitely blocks bad news if one can't see inside the establishment. &#160; &#160;A really sweet gal opened the door, and politely suggests if we would like to hang our coats before showing us to our table. &#160;And I'm down for that, until I can't find the coat rack... &#160;(Btw, AKA "Coat rack" is basically a belt hanger on the wall). &#160; &#160;The tables bump into each other, the wall, or (if you're lucky to sit near the entrance) be molested through the velvet curtains while people are fumbling to locate the opening.Their cocktails go beyond strong. &#160;I mean it's off-putting like paint thinner and ammonia. &#160;The "grape-beri knee high" was nothing but that. &#160;It did however come with a GENEROUS amount of lime juice... &#160;huh? &#160;Exactly, I wanted to know where the Chambord went.. &#160; Most offensive was their "Bourbon Cooler." &#160;Claims to be "insanely refreshing" but you would need to be on Quaaludes to make that kind of statement. &#160;It tasted and looked more like a bad batch of Gin on the rocks with a splash of cranberry juice for color. &#160;The alleged ingredients called for Evan Williams, Amaretto, OJ, Cran. &#160;I'm no connoisseur, but I can do some ingredient math in my mouth. &#160;That shit did not add up.So try it once and order a beer or something that comes pre-made in a bottle to keep it safe. &#160;Do not sit by the fortune telling-esque drapes near the door unless you liked to be grabbed gratuitously. &#160;Oh, and the unisex bathroom smell like urine. New York has ruined me.I was tickled to hear that the Speakeasy trend has finally hit Seattle (albeit several years late, but whatever). &#160;The name Knee High Stocking Co is super cute, and I invisioned a real 1920's cats meow sort of theme. &#160;You know, old records playing jazz, candlelit tables, etc.So my friends and I rang the doorbell and were greeted by a gal who asked if we had a reservation. &#160;Nope, we said. &#160;She smiled and let us in anyway, and there were several tables open. &#160;1980's Stevie Wonder was playing overhead. &#160;The decor was a miss. &#160;The menu explained the old fashioned liquors, which was helpful and cute, but riddled with cheesy clip-art.Our drinks were good and the service was good, people were nice, but how the hell is this a Speakeasy? &#160;Just because there's a doorbell? &#160;And from my experience and according to several other reviews, they don't even really stick to the "rules" they've created.I feel this place could be so charming and cute if they just stepped back and paid attention to the details. &#160;The details make all the difference! Cliff's Notes:--Friendly doorstaff.--Friendly, but rather slow, service (weekend, excusable.)--Prices not bad, nothing on menu over $10.--1 excellent beer discovery (Kapuziner wheat beer.)--OK decor, trendy vintagey bar in an excellent piece of real estate.--Disappointing drinks - huge dealbreaker. &#160;--Had to roll our eyes at the reservation/punctuality requirement &amp; attempt at cloak of mystery.--Am admittedly jaded after patronizing quite a few pseudospeakeasies over the years. &#160;--Including at bars that excelled in every area: drink quality, food quality, service, interior design.--Realize the reservation/clipboard drama is probably fun for people who've never seen it before. --Conclude that I am the wrong audience for this bar.Reasoning:I'm extremely glad that places are sprouting up that are focused upon mixology. I hope this lasts, because it makes it easier to get a drink. The presence of Knee High Stocking Co. is part of the broadly raised expectations for drink quality, therefore, I'm glad it's here. &#160; "Hiding in plain sight" on a prominent corner site in one of the clubbiest, trendiest parts of Seattle is silly, though. &#160;I prefer places that differentiate themselves by the craft of their offerings and the quality of their spaces, rather than primarily by the noise around the admissions process. The Speakeasy thing... at this point it's the experiential equivalent of a donut-shaped cupcake sprinkled with artisanal bacon and drizzled with truffle oil. It's everywhere and it ain't so special on its own terms. &#160;If there are extra hoops to jump through, then the prize had better be AMAZING. But this felt like it's trying &amp; failing at being the Milk &amp; Honey of Seattle.I'd overlook the rigamarole if the drinks were impressive, if the atmosphere were unparallelled, if anything at all excelled... Instead... no. My companion ordered something straight off the menu. It was too heavy on the Lillet, imbalanced. &#160;I took a risk, and requested a specific custom drink that involved certain ingredients, including clear specs: zero sweet, zero sour, strictly bitter, tiny bit salty. It's my litmus test for a bartender, to see first if they actually listen, and then if they craft it well. Instead I got: a very, very, very sour-mixy, unfinishable drink with no brine to speak of. Pucker up?I'm not sure if it was a case of miscommunication, as I ordered from a server and not directly from the bartender. Or if it was an inability to think on one's feet and intuit the best mix: naivete. &#160;But giving me precisely what I asked not to have is dealbreaker for me in a place like this. In any-old-bar I'll give a second chance (or avoid ordering anything complex in the first place.) But a Prohibition-inspired place... &#160;Fatal! &#160;Maybe it's better to stick to the menu recipes. But then that's not a bar with expert mixologists and meticulous attention to craft, that's a normal bar with a decent drink menu. &#160;The one amazing discovery here was a beer our other companion ordered. Kapuziner. It was GREAT. We would order this again. Overall, this bar was ok. The decor was vintage and divey; the space was rather awkwardly used.The drinks were ok. The bar has an ok selection of off-the-shelf options. Overall, nothing outstandingly bad or good. It's the hype that made the iffy drinks seem like a huge problem, rather than exactly what we'd expect from most bars.At this point - I suppose I'd go back if I were around, and with someone who really wanted to go, and I'd order scotch or beer. I'd also give the cocktails another chance on an off night rather than a weekend. But in Seattle, I distinctly prefer a few comparable venues with the craft-cocktail focus, but without actual Speakeasy games. &#160;Goes down a lot easier.UPDATE: &#160;A bartender from Knee High Stocking contacted me with an invitation to come in again and try some more drinks. &#160;I appreciate places that keep up with customer feedback and make an effort to be welcoming. That's pretty cool. The atmosphere is great for feeling like you have your own treehouse or secret room-- so that is a plus in my book for sure.I checked their menu online and was excited to try their mashed potatoes with broccoli smothered in cheese dish. &#160;I went there with a friend, who ordered the lamb burger: &#160;The potatoes were luke warm (if that), and my friend reported "Eh. I've had better." re: the lamb burger.Maybe the cocktails are great here. We didn't stay for any as the food was so bad. I always felt that I was born in the wrong era. &#160;I am drawn to the roaring 20's and am pretty sure I am reincarnated from that time. &#160;I was completely delighted to find this place and felt like I was walking back into a past life.I walked up and down Olive trying to find this place when meeting friends for dinner and drinks. &#160;There is no marquee and it is on the bottom of an apartment complex. &#160;All of the windows are draped over and there is a doorbell. &#160;You ring the bell and are invited in to what feels like a speakeasy. The punch is dangerous. &#160;In fact, all of the drinks are dangerous. &#160;You can not taste the booze and they are sooooo good. &#160;The prices aren't that of the roaring 20's, but they aren't these over inflated prices of this era, either. &#160;I'd say more of mid 90's...$8 for a tall glass of yummy is pretty good.Food was also pretty tasty and reasonable. &#160;We had some spicy nuts and a pretzel ($5) to start off. &#160;2 of my friends ordered the chicken pot pie ($15) and they might as well have snorted it, because they ate it so fast and didn't give us the opportunity to try it, so I'm assuming it was good. &#160;My other friend ordered the Mac n Cheese, there was a wide variety of cheeses and so I was surprised that the taste wasn't more vibrant, but I think that also had to do with it being so hot. &#160;I am pretty sure if we would have let it cool down the flavors would have come out a bit more. &#160;I had the vegetarian french onion soup ($7)and it was PERFECT, so very good!This is definately one of my new favorite places and be a staple when I bring out of town guests out on the town. As a Seattle regular people often ask for my advice when they're headed to this beautiful city. The very first place I recommend is Knee High, hands down, no question. Knee High is beyond as good as it gets. What a fabulous concept and unique experience. From the moment you enter you feel special and secretive. On our visit we nabbed a seat at the bar and enjoyed the conversation of the fanstastic bartender. She even called me striking at one point. Oh baby, flattery will get you everywhere! Some local Seattle patrons joined us at the bar and it was a memorable evening of Canadian/American comparisons and Seattle recommendations. I promise I will make it to the Bleu Room next time and no we don't say 'ruf'.The drinks are exquisite, the bees knees being my favourite. I can't remember what was in it, but I do know hot drinks make you drunker. Mmm the grape-beri was delicious too. Seriously some of the best cocktails I've ever consumed. &#160;I love Knee High like I love Seattle and can't wait for my &#160;next visit. One of the best Speakeasy's I have been to in Seattle yet!!! Came up to the single-lighted triangle building with my housemate late Friday night. Rang doorbell its infamous doorbell. Opens by a flapper dressed waitress who asked if we had text'd her prior in order to get in. Uhhhh nope. obviously no we had not made the key text to get ourselves in but never the less she graciously let us in. This place is really really intimate (i.e. best for dates). Bartenders here have the best personalities here, they really work the whole 20's appeal. Had a glass of their infamous Absinthe. Advised by the waitress she gave me a more milder version of the drink. It delivered a strong licorice flavor. Really going to make it an effort to be there for happy hour next time and get in on the punch bowl action. If you haven't tried this spot your really missing out on some of the best of Seattle's nightlife. This place is so overrated. Being such a tiny, somewhat exclusive place (although doesn't EVERYONE know about this place by now?) I thought there would be more care taken into the interior design and atmosphere. Instead it was completely generic...and why does it have to be so bright?A small room and a snooty hostess just isn't enough to impress me. The entire place reeked of pretension. If you're in the mood for delicious cocktails with a cool vibe (minus the attitude), go to Hazlewood, Sambar, or Oliver Twist instead. This is a throwback style boozer with lots of rules.Don't like rules? &#160;You won't like this place.So. &#160;Rules.1) Make a reservation, or they might not let you in2) No pictures since this is a downlow speakeasy and booze is illegal. &#160;The bulls might drive up in a jalopy and break down the door with a charging ox and haul everyone off to the pokey.3) It's also period sized food and period strength drinks. &#160;Small plates. &#160;Heavy KO-style booze.So yeah. &#160;Come. &#160;Have a seat as there is no standing. &#160;Oh yeah.4) &#160;No standing. &#160;The fire marshal in this 1920s bar said so...and chill out. &#160;Have some old school (and still kickass) powerdrinks. This place is totally awesome and I'm definitely becoming more of a regular at the bar. It's true it's small, but if you ever went there when it was a pizza place (before it was the current speakeasy), then you wouldn't be surprised.... This place is a text-message-only reservation to get in. &#160;If you show up and haven't texted to confirm you can get in, well then you're out of luck :( For a speakeasy, it's a fun little joint. They do have an extensive list of vintage cocktails which they definitely take their time to make for you. It's especially fun to sit at the bar I've found and watch them being made. One drink in particular, which I have yet to try, is called the "Moscow Mule." I've actually been told this was a very popular drink at speakeasys here in Seattle in the depression era. The only downsides to this place is that, although they claim to be a speakeasy, they really don't PLAY MUSIC from the era or LOOK too much like one. &#160;Usually in the times that I've been inside, they have Louis Prima playing... definitely NOT the music of the times. &#160;One time they had the New Orleans Jazz Vipers playing, which is a totally sweet New Orleans hot jazz band, and that was the most era-appropriate speakeasy music I've heard there... They also have a bunch of art on their walls that really could be found just about anywhere in any restaurant. &#160;When I think "speakeasy", I think of risque ziegfeld follies photographs and paintings of jazz music or flappers... instead, it appears to be mostly still-life paintings of fruit??But overall, the Knee High Stocking Co. is definitely a 4 star joint. The waitresses/bartenders are AWESOME and totally fun to be around. Their happy hour punch ($3/glass) which differs on the mixture from day to day is totally a great deal and always very tasty! The food is also delicious, so if you're looking for a fun and intimate bar to hit up w/ great cocktails and employees who love their job, this is DEFINITELY the place to go!!! Located in an inconspicuous spot at the street level of a building, the door was locked as we tried to open it. Then I locate the door bell and rang it. A very polite women came out and asked us how many in our party. We said,"three" and then she said, "Wait here for a second". One minute later she tells us that the only spot was a separate room because the main room was full. BAM!!!! We're in! (Luckily some people left and we got to sit out in the main room 5 mins in)Walking in you notice that this place is tiny! I think there is only room for 20 people that includes the seats at the bar. I don't think you can really just stand around. I ordered the Grape-beri Knee High drink, Lamb Mini Burgers and chicken pot pie. This is another great place to go and have conversations without having to yell because of loud music.My drink was bursting with fruit flavors and sour too(I love sour drinks). The Lamb Mini Burgers were so mouth-watering. The lamb meat was cooked to perfection (medium rare). When you first bite into the burger you can taste the mango chutney which helps to cool down the spices in the meat as you finish your bite. I could have eaten like 4 more! The chicken pot pie was heavenly! It was packed with lots veggies, huge portions of chicken and the sauce pulled everything together. The bread was so flaky and moist. The food was really excellent!The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. I'm throwing 4 stars at you guys!
The Chihuly glass inside is beautiful and gives you something to look at while you patiently wait for your dinning companion to decide what they want.From the bar I love the Zephyrtini minus the champagne; it's a tasty drink that wets my whistle just right. &#160;For dinner I strong arm my companion and make them share the fried chicken and mac and cheese with me, I always want both but never finish even half of each this way I win.With all the Chihuly glass the down home food gives it a warm and homey vibe. This place has very distinctive decor. &#160;The ceiling is covered with blown glass orbs in fleshy tones. &#160;It looks like a cross between the lobby at the Bellagio in Vegas and the Farallon's jellyfish room in San Francisco.The food was good, but not exceptional. &#160;I had the 8 oz fillet mignon and was a bit disappointed by the measly three potatoes and four sprigs of asparagus, especially for the price ($34). &#160;But it was all delicious. We've been here twice now, and both times, I've had a good experience. I think I really enjoy the food while I'm eating, but tend to forget soon afterwards. The hostess was very accommodating about getting us a table, tho, and for that, I have to give props.Oh, and the decor is very very orange. Great fish! Nice decor. There's something to look at everywhere--hand-blown glass lamps, interesting booths, ornate vases, pretty girls. But they would have gotten one more star for ratings if they had matchboxes! Trendy, but Seattle style...trendy but not trashy fake. Dessert was ingenious. Right on the menu, 'Dark Chocolate Cake with a Glass of Milk'. These people got it right.
This place embodies everything I hate most about stingy, nickel-and-dimer terikyaki joints in Seattle.The first time I came in to grab some lunch to go, I ordered white meat chicken teriyaki. &#160;I saw the tiny little teriyaki sauce containers at the register and assumed those are for people that want extra sauce. &#160;Food came out very quickly and I brought it back to the kitchen at my office. &#160;I opened my food to find grilled white meat chicken strips laying on rice, with a tiny obligatory salad, and absolutely no teriyaki sauce.I just have this philosophy: &#160;If you are a teriyaki restaurant, and you serve a dish that is called "chicken teriyaki", then there is an expectation that I should receive teriyaki sauce with my chicken. &#160;At the very least: &#160;having grilled the chicken with teriyaki sauce; this was plainly grilled chicken breast. &#160;I should not have to ask for the sauce, nor pay extra for it - it is part of the dish. &#160;I have the same problem with teriyaki restaurants that put a few drops on it, then make you ask for the teriyaki, or give it to you one sample up at a time, or even pay extra for it. &#160;Huge fail. &#160;I'm sure it's fine if you're a regular, and just know to order it. &#160;But you don't get the reward of my continued business for operating with such a terrible business model.If you're a teriyaki establishment, serving a teriyaki dish, then serve it with teriyaki sauce and offer it freely. &#160;That's a cost of doing teriyaki business.Second time I went, I dined in. &#160;I asked (and paid extra) for the teriyaki sauce. &#160;The food tasted fine.The third time I went, I dined in, and decided to try the bibimbap which came recommended by the co-worker that went with me my second time when I ordered it. &#160;Their picture and description indicated that it was a traditional bibimbap presentation, with all the fixins, even a fried egg. &#160;The cashier asked me what kind of meat I wanted, and I told her "chicken breast". &#160;That was the only choice offered, only point of customization asked. &#160;My food comes out a few minutes later, and I sit down. &#160;There's no egg. &#160;I look around and see several other patrons with an egg on their bibimbap. &#160;Every other place I'd been in Seattle serving bibimbap serves it with an egg. &#160;They must have forgotten my egg. &#160;I walk up to the man serving out the completed meals:"Excuse me, it looks like your cooks forgot the egg on my bibimbap. &#160;May I please get the egg that goes with my dish?""Did you order it?""Yes sir, I ordered the bibimbap." &#160;(I'm pointing at the sign with the picture and description.)"That's extra. &#160;It doesn't come with egg. &#160;You should have asked for that.""She only asked me what kind of meat.""There are three options. &#160;That's one of the options.""Ok, well your cashier didn't point out that I had to order part of the bibimbap dish as advertised as an extra piece.""Sorry, dude. &#160;You should have ordered it that way.""Well can I get the egg? &#160;To my knowledge, that's a standard part of bibimbap, and it's shown standard on your menu.""You didn't order it with an egg. &#160;Order it that way next time."So yeah. &#160;I won't be eating at International Teriyaki again. &#160;Be informed that you'll start with a $6-10 dish, and get nickel-and-dimed for everything that should be in the dish to begin with adding a few dollars, you won't get properly informed, and they'll treat you like ignorant trash the entire time.Oh and they'll call you "dude" when they're clearly don't have your back. A perfectly adequate teriyaki placeI go there because it's near my work ... it's fine, but nothing special. &#160;It is however the nearest teriyaki place. &#160;It's popular -- but pretty standard. At roughly $9 a plate, this joint is pricier than I like for teriyaki. That said, the food is great. They must be connected with Okinawa Teriyaki down near the waterfront because the sauce and menu are very similar. I gave that place 5 stars and would have with this one as well but for the higher price. Bibimbop has salad in it. [Should end review here] Charges extra for egg - what bibimbop doesn't come with egg? Convenience is the only reason this place exists. It's good teriyaki, but it costs about $11 for a regular plate and they nickel-and-dime you for every little thing. I'm assuming that the building rental is expensive, because they continuously raise their prices. This place used to be a good find for a decent lunch at a decent price. But lately, every time I step foot into this place, the price has gone up. You are now looking at the $10 teriyaki chicken hole in a wall lunch stop! The prices keep going up so much that they just put stickers on top of stickers on the menu because it would cost to much to redo the menu.The quality is not that great - maybe when it isn't cheap anymore my tastebuds expect the taste to improve. It is probably the same ol chicken they always served, but at $10 a plate for lunch, it should be better. To make things even better, they forgot to give me teriyaki sauce this time. I work too far away to head all the way back there while my luke warm chicken gets even colder.No more International Teriyaki for me. I am guessing they are trying to compensate for a lower daily turnout by raising the prices again and again. It is a death spiral if they keep going and I wouldn't at all be surprised to see an 'out of business' sign go up soon. I have to agree with Aiden P. Don't believe the hate! This place is great! I come here at least 1-2x a week and I literally wait until after 130 pm just to avoid the lunch time rush. This teriyaki joint is nothing fancy but since when are they?I'd love to try other things here as the menu is quite extensive but love my "usual" (#2, no rice, extra salad) so much - I can't quite get past that yet! I'm shocked this place doesn't have a higher rating on Yelp considering the line which stretches out the door on any given day. There's no popularity shortage happening here, though sometimes I wish there were.In short, the line speaks for itself even if the reviews do not. This place is fast, delicious and a solid bet for a yummy lunch! Their Teriyaki is good, the service is fast, and they're following the trend to offer brown rice. Inside seating is available though they are often very busy during the lunch rush. Either way though, they have a prime location for people watching downtown. My only gripe is that they don't have any Katsu dishes on the menu. Apparently this has something to do with Seattle's recycling laws and the complexities of disposing of fry oil. I'm not entirely clear on this choice but it's a bummer for Chicken Katsu lovers like myself. Other than that, just fine. I was laying over for a bus to Vancouver one day, I passed this place recognizing that they serve Bibimbap so I went back to the restaurant from the bus station, had bibimbap there. they are KOREAN! I could speak my korean to order isn't it amazing? the guy at the kitchen is so energetic, It was fun as well! the bibimbap is very authentic. you should mix well. I think this place is great. &#160;Ive tried a lot of teriyaki downtown, and trust me there are NOT a lot of good options. &#160;Price, yeah theyre a little high - but the food is good and everything I have tried tastes great. &#160;I go at least once a week, and I have even gotten my staff hooked on it. &#160;Just dont go at 12pm or you are waiting in line. &#160;I add extra meat, and make it spicy and walk out the door for $12 but also have 2 lbs of food to eat, so I get 2 meals out of it. &#160;If you want a $7 lunch go to Subway. I ordered bibimbab today. There were just a little of zucchini, carrots, bean sprouts and bulgogi. It was almost $10..very pricy and wan't taste good at all.I've tried their spicy chicken and wok,etc.. too greasy and too much fat on meats.I rather go other place. too pricy and not worth it Do you like to gamble?Give this place a try and see if you can beat the odds. &#160;I lost and spent a lovely evening on the toilet! &#160;I'll give them one star because it was still spicy on the way out, at least they got the spice right - no, wait, I did that myself with the sauce on the table. &#160;I asked for extra extra spicy and got plain old chicken teriyaki. &#160;A little cold too, I guess they didn't turn up the temperature high enough on the water heater in the warming bin. &#160;Maybe I will say the star is because it's so close to work, Yelp won't let me give 0 stars.A note to the cashier - I'm not going to pretip you when I'm paying for my order and just hope that your service warrants the tip, especially when you are charging me ten bucks for .15 cents worth of rice, 1.50 worth of chicken (and that's assuming the pieces are only good cuts), a handful of soggy cabbage and a splash of sauce. &#160;And I saw the cook take my chicken out of the warming bin, where there were pounds of precooked chicken, slap it on my plate and call it good. &#160;Without even warming the shit up. &#160;So if you are going to glare at me for drawing a line through the tip, you should check your operation and make sure your shit is in order and you're earning those tips. &#160;I come back and put money in the jar when you deserve it, not because you think you deserve it.
SO I never really enjoyed sushi until I tried it again here.Now we get take-out twice a month at least. &#160;And that's the best part, we get tons of sushi for $30! &#160;So it's affordable to have that often!The Spicy Crispy Chicken Roll is awesome, as well as the Shrimp Tempura Roll.Their Salmon and Chicken Teriyaki is delicous too!Go GO GO!! &#160;See for yourself
We ate here weeks and weeks ago but as we were painting today I asked Chris, "Which is your favorite sushi place we've eaten at so far?" and he said Bento. I was kinda surprised but can see where he's coming from. The Monkey Brains was, indeed, an excellent appetizer, and all the sushi was very good. I think we ordered a noodle dish too which was good though not outstanding. The whole place is so low key that every morsel beats your expectations. Good, and cheap the way I like it. My favorite Sushi chef used to be in Des Moines but in the last months disappeared to my disapointment but a few weeks ago we hit this place up for some picnic sushi and there he was! &#160;He used to make me some crazy concoctions and can see his influence on the menu. &#160; &#160;The service was fast (about 15 minutes for a large to go order) and only cost us about 30 bucks to feed 5 people. &#160;I agree with Johnny the spicy crazy roll was super tasty! You want good cheap sushi? &#160;Well here it is! &#160;The combinations here are a bit different from what you'd expect, for example the philly roll has tuna (not salmon), and also carrots and cucumber. &#160;But, just go with it and you'll be happy. &#160;I also highly recommend the spicy crazy roll.
I had gone by this place as they were moving in and preparing to open for business. &#160;I was very eager to come in and try a crepe.The interior design is a little disconcertingly orange. &#160;The attempted in vain to make bulges of walls less noticeable with some sort of ugly rubber sheet affair that probably only serves to make people imagine the walls are in worse condition than they really are. &#160;I have been in this retail space during several previous incarnations and this one is, in appearance, the worst. &#160;They should at least let people cover those walls with posters; my friend suggested travel posters.I had the Caramel Apple Crepe. &#160;I have to warn that I'm not a big crepe guy; I don't have a long and varied history of crepe consumption to compare my experience to. &#160;I thought it was pretty good. &#160;It's not something I think I would get half as often Ave staples like teriyaki (Nasai) or Thai (Tom's) or Chinese (China First).Crepes are like light, thin pancakes. &#160;According to Wikipedia they are usually made of wheat flour and even though they originate from northwest France they are popular throughout the whole French world in contemporary times.Our crepe came as a multilayered dish. &#160;At the bottom was a crepe covered here and there with what I think was apple sauce. &#160;Over that was a second crepe that had strings that formed diamond-shaped lacing. &#160;Over this were patches of caramel sauce. &#160;In the center of all this was a patch of whipped cream with caramel sauce drizzle.The crepes per se pretty much match my one memory of previously having crepes from about thirty years ago. &#160;I can't remember how I had those crepes so long ago. &#160;This time, though, the particularly savory bites were those from areas where caramel and apple collided in optimal ratios and amounts. &#160;I would have liked just a little more caramel and apple distributed a little more evenly.I found the staff to be nice enough. &#160;They are very smart to stay open until 3 a.m. Friday and Saturday nights. &#160;Along with Memo's, they are helping bring about the 24 hour Ave. &#160;They definitely need something to indicate that they are open after 9 p.m., because when we came by at 8:45 p.m. we were at first unsure whether they were open or not.It remains to be seen in crepes are another Ave gimmick food that will come and go or if they have any staying power. &#160;They are definitely competitive in price with a lot of the aforementioned Ave staples.Three stars is average, and average isn't bad. &#160;It's worth it to learn a friendly Russian greeting and go try a crepe or two. I had high hopes for this place but was a little let down. The interior is lacking and the only ambience was the 106.1 radio station blasting from the kitchen. But on to the food. I had the lunch special, which consists of one savory crepe, some slaw, and a bowl of soup. The soup was loaded with dill - not my favorite. It was passable. The slaw was light and paired well with my lamb crepe. The lamb was delicious and the crepe was good too. I guess I was just expecting more. I left feeling like I needed more food in my stomach than one crepe. Next time I'll just go with the two crepes and ditch the lunch special. The service when ordering is painfully slow, but maybe they were just understaffed that day? One guy was taking the orders, manning the register, and bringing the food out, and he was in no hurry at all. I would've ordered a dessert crepe but had to forgo it as a group of five that came in took over 15 minutes to order and pay for their food...and I had to get back to work. I will likely return someday to try their sweet crepes. Nutella is calling my name! Love this place! Crepes are fantastic, they serve both sweet and savory (and some vegetarian). Prices are super affordable. Hours are fabulous and the owners are so nice and superb. Definitely a destination place in the University District! (Also my suggestion would be the nuttella crepe with bananas, just saying it the best) I live right across the street and I find myself craving a lot of crepes recently!!! Crepe Craters has a pretty wide selection of meal crepes and dessert crepes. I wouldn't consider myself a crepe expert but I know that this place makes some greeeaaaat food. The ingredients are fresh, the flavors are unique, and the crepes just melt in your mouth. Definitely worth a try if you are in the u-district. You kind of have to hunt this place down. But, they serve up a pretty delicious varietal crepe. Everything from meat to fruit. I think crepes are really just skinny little pancakes, but crepe sounds so fancilicious. The surrounding aren't all so great, but put your head down and eat the crepe in front of you. I haven't had a such delicious meal in a long time. It is finger liking good and tastes like home cooked food all natural ingredients and I could not believe that for dessert menu they use real lemons. They have all kinds of crepes and my favorite are the ones with meat! Now I will always crave one!Audrey
So, this is a place I would have never known about if it wasn't for Yelp. &#160;Mainly because it is more of a neighborhood bar on 45th that I've driven by many times, but unless I was walking up and down the street, I would have never noticed it.Well, I am glad that I did find out about the place!This is a great relaxed place to come hang out, drink drinks, get some food and watch the game (on a large projector screen) or play pool in the back. &#160;They even know how to make a side car. &#160;Yes this is the place where bartender who stated that this was a classic drink and any bartender should know how to make it!!! &#160;BTW... I think you are one of the few bartenders / servers that can call me "dear" and get away with it!!!Ordered the $10 burger with add on any of the stated toppings for no additional charge and had it with onion rings... Yes, I fell back onto my get a blue cheeseburger with onions and sometimes mushrooms to test the food. &#160;The onions were done right, not raw but saut&#233;ed! &#160;Overall, for pub food, the burger and onion rings were good!Even though there is plenty of seating (tables and bar stools), for a Tuesday night, it was still pretty busy and not many choices for a place to sit. &#160;Here's to continued success!!! Place where everybody knows your name. Great deals for both happy hour and late nite. An owner that is there a lot and really gets to know and care about her patrons. Gotta love Kate. Kate's is fantastic. &#160;The servers were great and it seemed like they brought us our drinks before we even finished ordering them. &#160;The food was good and reasonably priced (mmm...mud pie).My friends and I went on trivia night (Monday), and even though we occasionally had trouble understanding the thick accent from the cute old Irish MC, we still had fun and enjoyed the questions (I knew my excessive Eminem knowledge would eventually come in handy). &#160;The biggest downside of trivia is that it doesn't start until 9:00pm and goes until about 11pm. &#160;Needless to say, my Tuesday morning at work was rough. &#160;Overall Kate's is a great place to spend an evening with friends. &#160;Go to trivia night when you get a chance, especially if you have spare sick days you can use the next day. Oh yes! &#160;I will be back. &#160;This place is awesome! &#160;I can't believe their happy "hour". &#160;3 hours of 1/2 off the entire menu &amp; good drink prices too, 7 DAYS A WEEK!!! &#160;And the food..... YUMMO! &#160;Came here for the first time last night to watch the Sounders Soccer game. &#160;Not much of a soccer fan group but they had it on the big screen so we were happy. &#160;(It was standing room only a Murphys Pub down the street)I had the make your own burger with chicken breast, mushrooms, onions, bacon &amp; hot sauce. &#160;Got the side salad instead of fries. &#160;Hubby got the reuben with side salad and we added an order of onion rings. &#160;I'd come back for the onion rings alone! &#160;They were perfectly cooked &amp; not greasy at all. &#160;After 9pm it was $3 Jamesons Whiskey special. I wish this place was in my neighborhood. &#160;The bartender also busts his hump making drinks &amp; serving the restaurant single handedly! Awesome happy hour!!! &#160;It's one of those pub you drive/walk by and said eh it looks alright.. Big mistake people! &#160;I don't know you but after a long day of work I want to eat!! &#160;Half priced on foods and cheap beer! The food was soooo yummy and it came out quick! &#160;But BEWARE after 6 it gets CROWDED! &#160;Free darts and pool out back ;-)FYI: &#160;The Guinness was actually poured correctly into my glass with a nice thick head! &#160;*OK get your mind out of the gutta!* I was introduced to Kate's Pub by a friend of mine who is quite fond of the establishment. &#160;Knowing her enjoyment of beer, I took her word that they would have a good selection, and was hopeful the food would be tasty, too.Basically, this is a sweet little place. &#160;Great happy hour prices, good drinks, good beer, good food, and a generally good atmosphere. &#160;Being here, one clearly realizes that there are plenty of regulars, however I have yet to been given the feeling that, not being one, I am any less appreciated (it may help that I've only been a few times, and each time with a regular :-))The bartenders are quite awesome. &#160;Being able to just say to one, "this is what I feel I need", and him picking it correctly is awesome. &#160;It's even more awesome that one already knows my whisky drink.The food is bar food. &#160;It's not Lark, and isn't trying to be. &#160;I'm not going to lie, I forgot what I had the first time I went (I know fries were involved), but I recall it being tasty. &#160;The fries could use more salt, but that's a preference, not a knock. &#160;I also have enjoyed the hot wings, which are spicy, meaty, and cooked right (not soggy). &#160;While the live music (been there twice for that...*eek!*) isn't my taste, it's not like they're bad at what they do, just not my style. &#160;So, for me, this would be an ideal companion to my other favorite bar that isn't full of hottie gays (Victory), and I do look forward to imbibing here as often as my schedule permits. &#160;Huzzah! Took a friend from out of town here for happy hour, and had a great time. The staff is super friendly, and they were right on top of refilling our drinks. I got food because it's all half off during happy hour and I couldn't pass that up. I got the pork wrap with mashed potatoes, and I really liked it. My friend loved his meal too. And their menu had such variety!! Seriously, whatever you crave I guarantee will be on this menu. It went beyond your average bar menu, and their food tasted better than your average bar foo.I loved the atmosphere. It was so laid back and the bartenders were super chill. i'll be back again for sure. The 50% off everything may be one of the best happy hour discoveries of all time. why can't everywhere be like this?! Maybe it's because Kate's is one of the closer bars to me that's not Dante's, but I love this place. It's my Thursday night staple for when I'm praying for Friday to come and all I want is an hour or two of good company and beer. Great atmosphere--bustling but not so much so that you can't hear people talk at all. It's the bar where you can get really shitfaced at if you want, but it's really a great time to relax and have fun over a few beers. There's a nice back room with free pool and darts. There are also good booths and tables at the front. Thursday nights they have $3 pitchers of Rolling Rock starting at 10, and in general they always have bottles of Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat, which is harder to find out in WA. Haven't had their food, but have heard great things about their half-off happy hour food. Overall, great old pub feel, perfect for bigger groups or one-on-one convos. And they have wi-fi too, just in case you want to facebook while having a jager bomb. Mmm...Kate's. I've only ever been here once, which is about 341274893270 times too few, considering I go to school at the UW. The happy hour is fantastic! Half price off the whole food menu, which is already pretty cheap to start with! A friend and I had fantastic burgers with onion rings on the side for $10 total! They have a pretty good standard menu with salads, sandwiches, and burgers but we built our own burgers which was nice because I've always wanted to Build-a-Bear just for the hell of it...except I don't really need more stuffed animals. So building a burger sufficed: bacon! hamburger patty! grilled onions! swiss cheese! fried egg (seriously)! It was fantastic.I don't really like beer, though, so I mostly prey on happy hours for the food. We went earlier in the evening so we missed out on Cheap Drunk Night...and it was really all three: Cheap ($3) Drunk (Jager Bombs) Night (only after 10 pm). The people who served us were pretty friendly and the place itself is all right: cozy, cave-like, a little loud, with TV's playing sports in a background. It's a pub. And a fantastic one at that. Somehow I went from thinking Kate's was "a-ok" to visiting sometimes to being somewhat of a regular (in spurts).I love stopping by Kate's for a beer and a half-priced food item during Happy Hour. Sometimes just for a salad, sometimes for a burger and a side dish. Depends. I have yet to enjoy any of their late-night drink specials, but they sound pretty darn good!I haven't had any food here that could be described as "amazing", but it feels kind of like going over to a friend's house and having them make burgers (or sandwiches or something similar) for you. I like it.I also enjoy the service here. Eric is always friendly and now we have memorized each others names. The last couple of times I finally saw the owner (Kate) and she has been great. My friend was recently served a luke-warm burger and he decided to mention that when Kate asked us how the food was. She immediately apologized and offered him a replacement burger. He said that it'll be fine... and she said that his burger was now on the house. That was.... well, let's just say we were very happy with how that turned out!Note: PBR has been replaced by Rolling Rock. There are also about 3 other beers that have been changed out. My favorite is probably the Serengeti Wheat by Mac &amp; Jack's.PS: On weekdays there are usually plenty of tables 4-5pm, but it frequently gets crowded after 6pm.So far I'll recommend the burger (veggie or beef), the wraps/sandwiches (don't have a favorite), and the fish &amp; chips. The meatloaf dinner was a-ok and the mac &amp; cheese is only good if you love the mac in a cheesy soup (which is not really my style). It's hard to not love a place after winning Pub Quiz Night the first time you play it. And it's not as intense as the RAM one but still has a jacketpot of moolah - I was almost jealous of the runner-ups though who got a free pitcher of beer. Oh and the trivia announcer? Rockin' Scottish accent. At least I'm 80% sure, it might have been Irish. Crap. Kate's is a refreshing change from the seedy dive bars that dot the Ave and it's not that far away from U.W. It's deceptively small looking from the outside but there's a back room with pool tables, some seating and dartboards. Definitely clean and a good, non-sketchy crowd. And there were $2 micro brews with just the perfect amount of froth. Might be after 11 pm or maybe just Monday nights. Apparently I have to go here more often to figure out all their specials and activities. &#160;Not to mention our winnings went towards extra buffalo wings and nachos! Congealed nachos though, ick - the buffalo wings were perfection though. So Kate's, I like ya, I do. *nods* I guess it's safe to say I enjoy a place if it accounts for 2/3rds of the entries on my credit card statement (but what does that say about me!?!...I live 5 blocks away, gimme a break!). &#160;The obvious selling points (cheap beer/booze during lots of happy hours, free darts/pool, fairly standard but well done cheap bar grub, etc) are well documented here but Kate's offers a few other perks...The dueling Eric bartenders and Smitty will cut-off your uberdrunky/low-tolerance friends when it's time, and will also tell your slightly less-hammered friend that the girl he's flirting with is especially maniacal and should be avoided...hard to put a price on that kinda service. &#160;Not that I order much outside of the beer and whisky world, but the gents at Kate's actually make pretty solid cocktails (girlie or otherwise) if requestedThe "No Journey" policy is key as well, as during my days as a nightclub doorman/bouncer I was subjected to "Don't Stop Believin" a minimum of three times a night. &#160;Apparently all the 4-nights-a-week-regulars ingested so much vodka and blow they must have forgotten that they had just done the same WOOOOOO!/singalong routine when the song was played an hour earlier. &#160;But I digress...Although I've killed many an evening there, Kate's also serves as an excellent starting point for other adventures nearby (especially after missing the 44 bus to Ballard at the stop across the street) or last resort.Thankfully, even with such cheap drinks and proximity to UW the douchebag ratio is fairly low, and I pray it stays that way... This is a decent place. &#160;A highly local group is usually present, but it's not like The Hill and paranoid about "outsiders" visiting Their Special Place.I had not been here for a while. &#160;I see people I know here occasionally for something planned or just say "yo sup" when I drop in.Mac and Cheese may be the official Seattle dish (with Pho as a close second) that people romanticize about. &#160;I don't really get why, but hey. &#160;It's tasty occasionally.I mention this because there is a bowl of mac and cheese with pulled pork here that is seriously hardcore food porn. &#160;It's hot and sticky and has a big chunk of meat. &#160;They even provide toast for you to wipe and clean up with when you have finished.I keep forgetting to come to trivia night here. &#160;Someone should invite me. Okay, We have been there enough times now to become almost regulars and have to up my rating. &#160;For bar food it is pretty good, I still say the fish and chips is my favorite. &#160;The atmosphere is great, I think anyone can feel at home there. &#160;The service is excellent and the drinks are a good pour. Kate's has been my second living room for about three years now. I became a regular the moment I stepped through the door and Kate's husband poured me a perfect pint of Guinness. From then on out I had a perfect pint waiting for me, regardless of who was working, before I even took my stool at the bar.In addition to the best happy hour prices in town seven days a week, and being only a few stumbles away from my front door, this place has the most welcoming vibe of any bar I've patronized (please note: patronize is of the second definition and not the first in the Oxford American Dictionary).If all the above mentioned awesomeness isn't enough for you, combined with free pool and darts, then perhaps you'll be persuaded by their weekly night offerings of pub quiz (Monday), karaoke (Wednesday), free live music (Saturday), and $3.50 imports (Sunday). On the other nights when there's no planned entertainment, there's still awesome drink specials and a low-key, neighborhood-feel to the place.Still not enough? How about it being a bar that attracts some awesome everyday people of all backgrounds. Blue collar, white collar, no collar - everyone finds a home in the booths, chairs, and stools of Kate's. I can safely say, almost everyone I have ever introduced to Kate's has become a regular of some sort. Even without my company.My only warning. Watch out for what they lovingly call the "crack machine" at the front corner of the bar. You'll get addicted playing trivia and matching games until your eyes go numb. I live a less than a block from Kate's and have often seen people standing around outside. Some look to be taking a smoke, others seem to be saying good byes. Rare are the times when I don't see a crowd under Kate's yellow awning. Upon finally take a peak myself I found it to be a wonderfully friendly and comfortable local pub. It's far too nice to be called a dive. The happy hour here is one of the most generous in the entire Seattle area. If I ever were to become a regular at a bar, this would be my place. It was fine. It was a pub. I had a cheeseburger. The server was nice. Will probably be back for happy hour and wait to be hit by the Kate-lovin' bug that seems to have bitten everyone else around here. Looking forward to it. This place is great. &#160;Like a block from my house and the happy hour (half off all food with a drink) is amazing. &#160;Even when it seems too full they'll break out the extra tables and chairs. &#160;They even gave us happy hour prices when we walked in at 7PM once, awesome. &#160;Tasty almost-but-not-quite soul food style dishes. Two things: amazing happy hour, amazing staff. Happy hour goes until 7PM and is half off everything on the menu. If you're a dude, the bartender will call you "boss", which at first might be offensive but you'll learn to love it. For the ladies, you'll get the twinkle in his eye. I have driven by Kate's Pub a gazillion times, and finally made it in for Happy Hour tonight. All food items are half price, which is a great deal. Four of us shared a pitcher and we each had a plate of food. Our bill came to $32!!!!! Awesome deal! I had a yummy Thai chicken wrap and delicious, crispy onion rings.It was pretty packed, for good reason. HH goes until 7 and there is free pool and darts in the back. Plus, Kate's was all decked out in Christmas cheer! Stockings above the bar and all. I'll be back for sure, and might even check out their trivia night! I would normally have given Kate's three or even four stars. &#160;Kate has always been sweet and her karaoke routine with hubby is hilarious. &#160;They know how to make all sorts of drinks and shots (the lay me down connely is dangerous). &#160;They were even polite enough to have me and my friends when no one else would (I won't expound upon that).But.... the last time I went there the bartender was such an asshole I wouldn't go back. &#160;It's usually too crowded to get a table at night and there are plenty of douchebags. &#160;Basically, there's no reason to go here &#160;when I could go somewhere else and get decent service and a table.ETA: &#160;I decided 2 stars was too harsh. &#160;They should only lose one star for a bad night (and being seriously slammed whenever I go). &#160;The fact is, though, I'm unlikely to return because I had a baby and don't go out and party like an idiot anymore. &#160;If I was still on the scene, I probably would have eventually gone back because we went here all the time back in the day.
Great date night place. &#160;We got the Paella Del Mar (Seafood Paella) and it was absolutely delicious. Lots of fresh tasting shellfish. &#160;And the rice was flavor nicely. &#160;Deep, rich and smooth. &#160;We also ordered two hot Tapas, the potato croquette and the sausage trio. &#160;The tapas did not disappoint. &#160;The highlight of the meal was the dessert-El Diablo. &#160;My god, it was one of the most deliciously decadent thing I've ever put in my mouth. &#160;Creamy, smooth, not overly sweet. &#160;I'm usually not a huge fan of chocolate desserts but this one is good enough to be an exception.Bring your partner next time here for a date night, you will not regret it. I'm surprised that I haven't written a review for this place!Tango is one of favorite restaurants!This place is consistently delicious and the staff are absolutely friendly!Let me start by saying that the first time I came to Tango (about 6 years ago) I wasn't absolutely sure about Tango, whether I liked it or not. However, a few days past and I craved for the queso fundido (pairs well with a glass of malbec!). &#160;I've gone back and have had almost everything on the menu. I'm not disappointed about this place and look forward coming here every time. &#160;This place is innovative and delicious. &#160;I've always been the type to try a little bit of this and that... and the small tapas dishes allow you to do so. Well worth your money and don't forget to get the paella! Mmmm... tapas. :)I've only been here a handful of times, but the first thing I do when I sit down is immediately order a round of &#160;"cheap dates" for the table - so - delicious. &#160;Their ceviche's and cheese plates are generally very good as well, and don't pass up the wild mushroom medley. Actually, I don't think I've ever really had anything here I don't like. Drinks are good, nothing overly original - no screaming deals or anything, but good. OH - last time we ordered a pitcher of sangria... muy beuno. Our servers are always nice, mostly knowledgeable (although they sometimes wait for you to order before they tell you what they are out of - and that's annoying, especially since they tend to run out of things quite often....) and attentive. Ambiance is classy casual - or dressy, &#160;but not formal. It's quite large so groups would be fine I think - although I'd make a reservation for more then 4 people. &#160;Parking is street parking on capital hill, so... that speaks for itself.Overall - good food, good service, nice atmosphere, I never turn down an invite to Tango's. &#160;:) We passed this place on the way to Taylor Shellfish Farms, and after getting our fix of oysters, we decided to stop by here to grab some dinner. It was packed, and we didn't have reservations on a Friday evening, but the host sat us at a booth in the bar promptly which ended up being a great choice because the booth was more cozy than the dining tables and we met some really awesome servers and bartenders through the night.It's a bit darker in the restaurant, but gives it a very laid back and possibly romantic vibe. We started with sparkling wine and red wine, and given some bread and butter. The bread is almost cornbread like, a bit dry for me, but my friends enjoyed it. We ordered several tapas that were all delicious.Cheap Dates - dates wrapped in bacon - really good but just a tad too sweet for me.Queso Azul - blue cheese souffle. Very tasty, and not heavy on the blue cheese.Croquetas de papas - a horseradish croquette. This was really nice, and was not heavy on the horseradish at all.Tortilla - Spanish omelette with potatoes and other veggies - one of our favorites.Queso Fundido - Spanish cheese that was baked with sausage, which went really well with the apples and crositni. It's a bit heavy as it's very cheesy, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.We also had this prawn dish which the prawns were huge and so good.My friends also ordered a seafood dish that was not a paella, but practically like it (but they said it was half the price of a paella dish). This was our absolute favorite. The tomato broth, rice, and seafood were all cooked nicely with the spices. I wish I knew the name of the dish, but it was splendid. We enjoyed everything about it!They also brought out a complimentary El Diablo. It was a rich chocolate mousse that had a cayenne pepper and spicy almonds. You definitley feel the heat after the cool dark chocolate.Our server/bartender, Collin, was awesome in every aspect, and the other bartender was great as well. We ended the night with drinks at the bar, and enjoyed our time here.Would definitley recommend and would come back in the future. I came here with 3 friends for my birthday celebration on Monday March 12. &#160;Mondays are half-off wine bottle nights, so we enjoyed a bottle of the delicious 2009 Salida Tres Vi&#241;os ($46) from the Yakima Valley. &#160;The wine was excellent and as the wine menu states, "From winemaker Doug McCrea comes this rich wine with notes of red berry, black cherry and spice with hints of vanilla and coconut."The service was excellent! &#160;Our waitress was knowledgeable and efficient, and made our dining experience great. &#160;For tapa starters we shared the Spanish olives and toasted almonds ($6.5), queso azul ($2.25), green beans &amp; harissa ($9), croquetas de papas ($9), ensalada valencia ($8) and beet escabeche ($9). &#160;All the tapas were unique and delicious and everyone was very happy with our selections.Our entree was the vegetarian mushroom paella ($34). &#160;The paella takes 50-60 minutes to prepare, which was fine considering we had plenty of starters and wine to drink. &#160;The paella was enough for 4 people and was amazingly delicious! &#160;Generous servings of mushrooms, artichokes, peppers, zucchini, and peas and spiced perfectly. &#160;For dessert we split El Diablo ($10). &#160;Amazing! &#160;Chocolate cubes spiced with cayenne pepper served with a tequila caramel sauce. &#160;Everyone loved it. &#160;We even got free birthday pours of tawny port to accompany our dessert!This is an excellent restaurant for any kind of celebration, and a fun dining experience. &#160;4.5 stars. Haven't been here in a while but the HH menu is solid. That's all I have EVER had here. I was looking at the menu this last time and started to drool. This is 4 stars for HH, location, price, and staff. They make a great Mojito. Meatballs are bomb-diggity. Cheese dip is amazing. Cerveche is fresh fresh fresh. Actually, now that I am thinking about it (and writing a few days post-Tango-heaven later). I should head back up there now... We came here for the Dine Around Seattle special. &#160;I'm not normally someone that hits these and then orders off the fixed menus, but I had looked at the menu and beef tenderloin and El Diablo were on there. &#160; &#160;So, I was on it like fuzz on a bunny.There are several segmented seating areas inside Tango. &#160;There's a strip along the window, along with a separate boxed in seating area, several tables deeper inside, along with a bar area. &#160; With a high ceiling, noise wasn't much of an issue.I grabbed the tenderloin and my El Diablo. &#160; My friend cashed in on something like a seafood stew. &#160; My tenderloin was perfectly done, fork tender and feathered over some sliced, roasted potatoes. &#160; My friend's stew was awesome. &#160; Spicy, tomato based but not overly sweet, with pillows of seafood. &#160; She had a scoop of rice in there, which soaked up the broth and uh.....I think I stole nearly a third of her dish. &#160;She paid me back by eating half of my El Diablo. &#160;Nuff said. &#160;Her cake....infused with grand marnier, was tasty but paled in comparison. &#160; She knew about ED (El Diablo) but insisted on not ordering the same as I. &#160; Mistake. &#160;It's okay. &#160;We're still friends. SDC strikes again...on a mission for Tapas. Seattle Dining Club picked Tango for Tapas. Which is what they do best.Don't skip the Dates!!! They very well might be my favorite thing on the entire menu. Even over the infamous dessert! Big group still feels intimate in the small wooden tables and chairs. Felt like dinner at a friends house. Which was FUN!Sangria...questionable. Stick with the wine. Also, the Paella was somewhat dry and not what I remember from Madrid. But the rest of the gang loved it. Tango is one of the awesome establishments that truly deserves 10 stars, all sparkly and bright! &#160;The food is incredibly fresh and prepared with a great deal of care. &#160;I actually wanted to lick the pumpkin seed-cilantro pipien off my plate. &#160;I tried, but my husband pulled me away, lest we damage our foody reputations..To get in, you need reservations. &#160;Without, you risk sitting at the bar in tall, narrow seats squished thigh to thigh with your fellow patrons. &#160;Tango also has a GLUTEN FREE MENU! &#160;They are extremely knowledgeable and accommodating to people with food intolerance/allergies. &#160;Seriously, this is my absolute favorite restaurant! I love this place. And the food. And the people.This is a long over-due review, as I've been coming here a few times a year for 3 years, loving it every time.Tango is so great, that I ended up picking it to host my boyfriend's surprise 40th birthday party. A year later (today in fact!), all 43 guests of that party are still talking about what a fun night it was. First, how easy can it be to host a group of 43? Not easy. I was a waitress at a point in my life, and there is nothing more daunting than large groups. But the Tango staff was amazing. They were an integral part of why the party was a huge success.The guests were blown away by the quantity and quality of the food; a majority had never been to Tango before, but they left with a new favorite on their Seattle restaurant list.A couple weeks after that party last year, my boyfriend and I went back to Tango. We were like celebrities or something. Three different waiters and the owner came to our table to tell us that THEY had so much fun at the party! How cool, that they had fun too. What a nice bunch of people.The food to try: paella, Cheap Dates, tuna, El Diablo....well, everything. Just try everything. That's the beauty of tapas restaurants. Oh yeah: great happy hour too! I absolutely adore this place. The food is fantastic. The service is great and the desserts - OMG amazing!I highly recommend getting the Queso Fundido. Don't plan to eat it yourself... it's great to share is 3-4 other people.Also highly recommend the Paella Con Carne. This is a traditional dish of meat served and cooked on a bed of rice. Again, it easily serves 4 people. So don't think that you'll be able to eat it by yourself.Finally, make sure that someone at the table gets the El Diablo. This is a chocolate mouse dish with cayenne pepper inside of it. And it's all served on a bed of soft meringue and fresh caramel sauce. AMAZING! Heard of this a lot and finally tried it. &#160;In summary, very nice experience, but a bit pricy comparatively speaking.Of course you come here for Tapas. &#160;But make sure you order Paella first or even over the phone, since it takes a while to make. &#160;We did just that, then munch on Tapas to wait for the Paella. &#160;The wine, recommended, was a bit weak but tasty. &#160;Tapas were very good too.While I was waiting for the companions, I ordered a margarita. &#160;Very sharp lime taste and everything just right.The much awaited Paella (mxita) is a bit disappointing. &#160;The rice was cooked/baked in a iron pot, then meaty ingredients piled on top, instead of cooked into the rice. &#160;The rice, aromatic and delicious, was a bit dry and caky, instead moist and creamy as I expected. &#160;The saffron aroma was very nice though.The "El Diablo" dessert is a flourless chocalate mouse cake with a bit cayenne bite. &#160;Very rich and interesting.Overall, very nice experience but a bit over-hyped by my fellow yelpers. I'm well-versed in the art of tapas and Tango executes beautifully.We sat at the bar after going to see a movie on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Attentive and pleasant service.Ordered a few things off the happy hour menu. The chickpea and garlic spread was a hit as were the meatballs. The only miss for me queso fundido. &#160;It got cold and hard to manage quickly and basically was just kind of a PITA. It was left alone to go to the queso graveyard.Muga by the half-bottle - WHAT? I didn't even know that existed. But then again, 9.9/10 I'm ordering a full bottle.Definitely a nice place to spend happy hour. I'm rating their dishes I had a 4/5 but I don't know about the price.Their steak thing is delicious, but it's such a small portion. Their pork one too, great, but such little plate!Their tres leches is nasty, and so is the diablo. I give those a 2/5. Otherwise, service was great. Pretty nice, and pretty chill place. After watching an evening musical at the ACT theater, Tango was the next stop for a late night bite and some quality tapas-style dishes.The signature sign with the restaurant's name is very pronounced and gives off a flair of authenticity and welcomes potential diners to this establishment with a picture of a woman that appears to be dancing the tango.After walking in, I was immediately absorbed into an atmosphere of romance and mystique with the dimmed lighting and warm colors. &#160;I really liked the decor of the place and the stacked wine bottles along with the various wall art.As is customary, we started off with the sangria which was nice and refreshing, although it was missing the little chunks of fresh fruit that I usually prefer to have in my sangrias, similar to the type they serve at Fresca in San Francisco.The first dish to arrive was the queso azul - fallen Valdeon blue cheese souffle with a seasonal fruit compote served on a port wine reduction. &#160;The souffle was light and fluffy and the compote topping was nice and jammy with just the right balance.Next on the list was the albondigas - Spanish meatballs with beef and spicy pork served with a tomato-pimenton sauce, Cotija, and grilled baguette on the side. &#160;These were quite good and I would probably order these again on my next visit.The "cheap dates" tapas dish was actually the second time ordering a dish that consisted of dates being used as the main ingredient, the first at Purple Cafe (this seems to be popular in Seattle). &#160;However, these dates were wrapped with bacon and served with pickled red onions and a balsamic reduction sauce; it was delicious.For the finale, it was suggest by our waiter to try the infamous El Diablo dessert. &#160;This block of chocolate cake was extremely rich and sweet and definitely intended for at least two people. &#160;Let it be known this particular dish was featured somewhere on the Food Network, and I can see why.But the real highlight of the experience was the wonderful service that was received. &#160;The waiter was extremely helpful with recommendations, not only about the fare on the menu, but also with ideas for places to go after dinner. &#160;He even offered to escort us to a few bars located around the corner, a place where supposedly most bartenders and other waitstaff like to go after work and hang out.This is definitely a go-to spot for any type of craving for tapas-style dining and I would make a sincere effort to come back if I'm ever in the area. My wife and I will make a point to come here whenever we're in town.1) The food is just fantastic; fresh ingredients, well prepared, good sized portions.2) The cocktails are clever and innovative.3) The menu is flexible whether you just want drinks and appetizers or a full course meal.4) Wait staff sincerely friendly: not rude and not fake-smilely.5) Expansive gluten free menu, important for my wife.Make reservations on the weekend, we could barely get into the lounge the first time we came. &#160;Also, the El Diablo is just too damn spicy, although I can understand the raves from people who have that kind of palate.Highly recommended. Absolutely fantastic happy hour! Goes late, and has something other than the hummus plate, burger, and/or truffle fries - all that seems to be on HH menus as of late. Great service, and they let you have happy hour throughout the restaurant. I have only had dinner here once, but happy hour several times, and their cocktails are delicious...now if only parking was easier to find... Very romantic place and I love the food here but if you're a big eater like me, you'll spend a lot of money to get full. I guess that's what tapas bars are like but just saying! LOVE Tango! favs are croquetas and green beans, the amazing pork, and paella. Do not miss the Diablo chocolate cake-- it is absolutely amazing. Great service ! I took my sales team of 20 there last night for a celebration dinner and the entire experience was great! I went to Tango with 7 other friends on restaurant week. I personally like the food a lot because I like heavy flavoring food but some other friends thought it was a little too heavy for them.The service was great! We are big group, so we sit in a private room back at corner. The waitress were coming in constantly and filled our water regularly. We found the dessert were great, we ordered three different desserts and they were all good. We may not be craving for Tango's warm dishes but will definitely come back for it's desserts! I guess the worst thing you could do coming back from a trip to Spain is try to recreate that experience at a Spanish restaurant in Seattle lol.......with that said my travel buddies and myself found our meal here pretty enjoyable. &#160;The three of us shared the Del Mar paella and a few of the hot tapas plates and although the paella did not compare to it's motherland counterparts it was still delicious and the seafood was fresh and nicely prepared. &#160;The service was very excellent and the atmosphere was very comfortable. I absolutely loved this place! Tango's location is very convenient if you're going to see a show at the Paramount Theater. My husband and I were about to do that and felt like grabbing a bite. We didn't have a reservation, but we were immediately seated at a very nice table by the window. We had several tapas. They were all made with fresh ingredients and were simply delicious. My favorite was the Croquetas de Papas. But my husband loved the Spanish Olives they served us. I also had the Bistec a la Parilla and it was delicious. It was cooked just as I asked and expected it to be. Their wine list is extensive.And the service itself was prompt and courteous. We're going to see another show this months. I'm looking forward to going back to Tango for more tapas. This place is awesome and has really good tapas... and their dessert is even better. You've gotta try their El Diablo mousse. I went there last night for dinner and it was pretty damn good. I will be back.It was a bit pricey and very filling but I enjoyed every bite. Also, they have some great drinks on the menu for you to try. And best of all for those who are like me and hate waiting in lines... they take reservations. I have never had a bad experience here, and the blood orange caipirinha is possibly one of the top 5 drinks in Seattle proper. &#160;The sauteed mushrooms are delish as are the mini pork carnitas.Of course, every night ends with a El Diablo-gasm. &#160;A+++ Service and an even better community partner. Fun tapas place close to convention center and paramount. Great service, good selection of Spanish and local wines, good variety of tapas, all presented well. Hands down the best tapas we've ever had! We almost had to be rolled out the door because we couldn't stop ordering and eating. We tried the cheap dates, albondigas, wild mushrooms, stuffed peppers, ensalada con pato salad and MOQUECA. The Cheap Dates were very tasty and served with a drizzle of balsamic but missing the almond in the middle to give it a little crunch. The albondigas were amazing and very filling. The stuffed peppers were delicious and all of the flavors in this dish popped! The wild mushrooms were sooooo good and have that deep delicious flavor that pulls from you that mmmmmm that comes out as almost an unententional foodie moan..... 2nd best of the night was the ensalada con pato. This salad absolutely melts in your mouth. The duck paired with the spinach and nuts is an amazing combination. Best of the night was the moqueca! &#160;When we go back to Seattle we'll stop in just to have this dish again!!! Absolutely delectably delicious!! It is one of those dishes that you almost feel like you have to be gentle and slow when you eat it because it is such an incredible treat! Unfortunately after eating all of this we didn't have room for their signature desert, the Diablo. I'm pretty sad that we missed out on it but we will be back Tango! The food was good!The sangrias were plentiful. &#160;The service was nice.This is one of those spots you go out to before clubbing, which is what my group did. &#160;They were very accommodating for a huge group and I was happy we went here.(my last three posts haven't had much to say about the places. &#160;This weekend the restaurants were great, and okay. &#160;Not much to say.)Come here sometime for an upscale trendy happy hour! I've been here for happy hour and the drinks are good. The tapas are amazing and tasty! I have not tried their famous Diablo dessert, but will likely return to do so. Love the atmosphere. Ths place is nice. The food was great, the waitress was on key. I couldnt' have asked for a better experience. Great HH, been here several times. &#160;Always a good deal, good HH specials for drinks as well. &#160;3.75 rounded to 4, as service here sometimes can be off and on, very inconsistent, but other than that, love this place. Went there after dinner for a couple great cocktails, had a fresh white sangria which was excellent. &#160;Excited to try the food. I've been to this place twice and have loved it both times! &#160;Great atmosphere, great service and of course wonderful food. &#160;Our server was wonderful - we were a group of ladies out on the town enjoying good food and drinks and she was so supportive of our good time and shared in the laughter. &#160;They are very knowledgeable about the diverse dishes they serve, and don't hesitate to recommend, or not recommend, something when asked about it in context. &#160;And OH MY GOSH...EL DIABLO!!!! &#160;It IS everything 'they' say it is. &#160;Wow, &#160;Thumbs up!!! I absolutely love this place. There hasn't been one time that I haven't been treated with the upmost best service. The servers, bartenders and hosts are always attentive and strive to make the experience nothing less than excellent. I'm &#160;a vegetarian and I usually have a hard time eating at Spanish oriented restaurants but Tango offers and pretty good selection. The ceviche is delicious! &#160; ... I gotta rave because no review on Tango is complete with the El Diablo rave. Best freaking cake in Seattle. Hands down. El Diablo dessert was off the hook. &#160;A blend of flavors - tequila caramel, fresh meringue, rich chocolate, toasted almonds, and cayenne for a unique twist. &#160;All of the dishes that we tried were well-prepared and flavorful. &#160;Cheap Dates were a perfect combination of sweet and salty - hot and fresh. &#160;Queso Fundido was slightly spicy, VERY cheesy. &#160;Ensalada Valencia added a fresh, light addition to the cheese. &#160;Gambas Picantes also had a wonderful blend of flavors - shrimp were tender and meaty. &#160;The portions were adequate for 3-4 people to have a taste. &#160;To make this evening even better it was half-price Monday on wine so we had a nice bottle of Baron de Ona. Great atmosphere and the food was great; only thing that missed the mark was the wine/pricing. &#160;Excellent variety on the menue and it tasted fantastic - atmosphere was charged and it was hopping. &#160;Will definitely be back, but maybe on half price wine night to reach a higher quality bottle! Five years ago I vacationed in Seattle with a friend, and after a day of eating our way around the city we wrapped up our foodie tour with the El Diablo. Fast forward to tonight and while reminiscing with my friend I confessed to her that on multiple nights I've stayed up googling the El Diablo, trying to capture the taste in my mind. Lo and behold, I wasn't alone, and she too vividly remembers this dessert that we can't get out of our heads. This is surely a candidate for the best dessert I've ever had; if you're in the area, don't it! Great small plates, and very authentic Spanish Style food plus fabulous service made for a very nice night out. Nice atmosphere, cheap dates are tasty, need to explore more of the entrees as what we had was just ok. I LOVE tapas! &#160;Its hard to mess them up, and i tend to highly rate all tapas places. &#160;I think Tango is another great example of a good tapas restaurant. &#160;The "cheap dates" were so delicious, and the El Diablo dessert is one of the bets mousse dishes I've ever tasted. &#160;The cheese plate was very tasty, but it comes with nuts scattered all over it, so beware if you're allergic. &#160;Wasn't the hugest fan of the queso fundido, but everything else i tried was great and I'd order it again. Love this place! It has the best Tapas in town and an amazing Paella. We always go there for group events or birthdays. Here are some great items on the menu: the devil chocolate cake, dates, paella. All delicious! The "cheap dates" are good--not as good as Ocho's, which are great. The queso fundido was a toothsome treat; and we also had a shrimp plate of some kind that was just fine. My wife and I shared a pitcher of sangria. We are not sangria conoisseurs, but we thought it refreshing. Service was prompt and friendly; nice atmosphere. Prices are about what you'd expect to pay at a trendy joint downtown.
This place has the best Thai food in Seattle! &#160;The workers are extremely efficient, which is helpful when there is a perpetual line out the door. &#160;Things to Know About Mae Phim:1. &#160;If you want to avoid a long line, don't even try to go there between noon and 1 pm. &#160;It doesn't matter what day of the week you go, they are always busy.2. &#160;They cook the food really quickly, so it is better to order in person, even if you want it to go, so don't call in an order. &#160;Trust me, the food will taste better.3. &#160;Everything on the menu is $5.50 ($6 after tax); you can't beat that price this side of Thailand!4. &#160;The sit-down space is tiny, so don't go there with more than four people and expect to get a seat (unless you don't mind the curb outside).5. &#160;If you go there a lot (ok, I have a mild addiction to this place), they are extra friendly and will let you create your own dish!Try it, you'll like it! &#160; :) If I were that annoying Rachel Ray, this place would make me smile my HUGE and maniacal clown smile and holler out "YUMMO!!!!!!" at the top of my lungs.As it is I am a sedate middle-aged lady with rosebud lips and a demur demeanor, and I would never blurt out anything as goofy and lunkheaded as "Yummo," even if it were my million-dollar catch-phrase.Instead, allow me simply to say that Mae Phim Thai is what fast, tasty food from a bare bones hole-in-the-wall kitchen is all about. &#160;I can't speak to the "authenticity" of its Thai-ness, having never been to Thailand. &#160;What I can compare it to is other Thai food I've had, both upscale and lunch counter, and in that comparison, Mae Phim Thai rocks.Everything is cheap. &#160;Everything is fresh. &#160;Everything is made to order - no steam table nonsense here. &#160;If you ask for "Thai hot" they'll make your order Thai hot. &#160;I asked for my spinach/tofu/peanut sauce last week to be prepared 6 on a 1 - 5 hotness scale, and lo! &#160;It was a 6! &#160;I mean, screamin' hot, but not blow-your-head-off inedible. &#160;Not to mention a generous portion of top quality firm tofu, lightly steamed baby spinach at the peak of freshness, and smooth, unctuous peanut sauce.Again, not sure if a purest or a world traveler would find this place authentic, but it's a great deal, really fast for lunch, always fresh, and every dish I've tried has been tasty. &#160;Not a dud in the lot. Best takeout Thai in Seattle!We like to head there on a Saturday when the place is practically empty.Super friendly, and delicious! I knew nothing of Mae Phim until March, when I started a new job in an office building about three blocks away. I was quickly clued in. This is the overwhelming favorite lunch spot for the office. There's a small dining area that I've yet to use since I always get takeout. My current favorites alternate between Swimming Rama and Ginger Chicken, with the occasional diversion to Phad Thai, the can't-go-wrong staple of Thai restaurants everywhere. THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW:- Heat on a 1 - 5 star rating, yes, just like everywhere else. The difference from other Thai places is that they will believe you when you tell them five stars. If you're a heat-seeker visiting Mae Phim for the first time then I strongly suggest you start out with a three-star and then working your way up.- DELIVERY. Yes, they do. During the week, to downtown locations, for orders over $24. We do a fair amount of group orders at the office and this comes in handy.- ORDER AHEAD. You have two options: Calling or using the Web site (Google for "mae phim thai") if you're phone-phobic. Although the kitchen is fast, it's nice to simply walk in, pay and leave within the space of 30 seconds. - $$$ CASH ONLY! They do not take plastic, not even if you whine loudly (as the woman in front of me yesterday, who seemed to think doing so would make the cashier pull a card reader out of her rear, found out). It's not a drain on the pocketbook as currently every dish they sell is $6/including tax. I stumbled on to this place when I was headed to the New York Pizza Place that was next door in the early 90's. &#160;Instead of pizza I decided to check out the new place because of the wonderful aroma emanating from the restaurant. &#160;The food was awesome and I was quite impressed by the quick service, meal selection and price. &#160;It was somewhere in the neighborhood of $2.50 or $3.00 back then. &#160;Now they have 30 items on their menu and still a great deal for $5.50. &#160;If you can get in early from 11-11:30 a.m. you should be able to get a seat, but be prepared to wait in line. &#160;Otherwise try heading over after 1 p.m. &#160;I usually avoid the lunch rush and phone in my order. Fast and efficient. &#160;Little thinking required. &#160;Go in with $6 cash, pick a number, and you're set. &#160;They even have stacks of 4 $1 bills in case you're a noob and come in with a $10 bill. &#160;I like the pick a number at random method. &#160;The Mae Phim special is pretty good too. &#160;(#14?) &#160;Frequent visits by us Zillow peeps. &#160;Check it out. You know that you have stumbled upon a "find" when the line stretches out the door onto the sidewalk, even on rainy Seattle days. What is more significant, and demonstrates that this is not a *flash in the pan* phenomenon, is that the line has been stretched out that door since I remember going there in the late 1990's .... when it was even cheaper! &#160;The service is fast and friendly in an albeit small cramped location. &#160;You can order a small soup with an entree for $1 (I don't think that it is on the menu anymore). &#160;The food is reliably fresh and cooked well. &#160;The ingredients are undeniably fresh (large piles of veggies delivered daily in the early am), thus making the end product tasty. &#160;Don't mention to co-workers that you are picking up an order unless you want to end up carting several entrees back! It's right across from where I work, and I was made a believer from the first day I ate there.My main dish is the Panang Beef, but you can't go wrong with the cashew chicken, chicken curry, Mae Phim Special, pad kee mao, or a couple of the soups they have to offer. &#160;I challenged myself to eat there every day of the week a few months ago. &#160;I had a different dish each day. &#160;It sounds sad, but my tummy thanked me. &#160;Also... if you are regular you get a smile and handshake from Rob* every time you come in.*His name isn't really Rob, but that's what me and my coworks call him. What can I say except that I didn't really understand the Seattle Thai food craze until I visited Mae Phim.I have this really dorky friend (love you Jeremy!) who has nicknames for places. &#160;He calls Mae Phim "Turbo Thai," because it is lightning fast. &#160;He calls Cilantro around the corner "Lento Thai," because it is slow. &#160;There is one joint in Sea-Tac that he calls "Exo-Thai." &#160;And probably my favorite is "Freedom Thai," which is this place in Georgetown that proudly displays a picture of George W. Bush, the best president ever. &#160;I think we can all agree about that.So anyway... Turbo Thai is fast, cheap and delicious. &#160;It has many loyal customers who crowd into the tiny place at the lunch hour. &#160;Heaven is their Thai fried rice and chicken curry. &#160;Every once in a while, I will have their garlic chicken too. &#160;Their soup is also very good on a cold day. &#160;If the five-star heat isn't enough for you, they will bring you some extra hot sauce -- I'm not sure what it is, but it is this grainy stuff that is sweet as well as hot. &#160;Race your friends to see how hot you can get it, and you will have a great time.The staff is friendly and efficient and appreciates the regulars. &#160;As I was saying, it didn't really hit me why Thai food was so popular until I tried this place, and let me tell you, it's all about the cilantro.One of my favorite Thai dishes is Phad Kee Mao (or is it Phad See Ew?), and Turbo Thai does not use the big noodle like I've had at other places. &#160;So I have to give it four stars because of that. Ok, I have the utmost sympathy for anyone who got sick or died from eathing organic spinach. What an ironic way to go. But does that mean that all spinach everywhere is bad? When there's a tragic airplane disaster people keep flying. I'm really trying not to be callous, but when I order Swimming Rama I want to eat that bed of spinach smothered in peanut sauce. I drove by here today at 11:30 and there was already a line out the door, so we called in an order and someone at work went to pick it up. We both ordered Swimming Rama but didn't think to ask if spinach was actually available - wouldn't you think if it wasn't someone would say something? Rhetorical question. They didn't. The rice was great. The chicken very tender and the mixed veggies that perfect balance between cooked and crunchy. I loved the peanut sauce. But it just wasn't Swimming Rama without the spinach. I'm still feeling blue about it. And terribly afraid to go to the grocery store now. Don't think I could stand seeing the empty spot where my favorite green vegetable once lived. Can't live without it! &#160;It's a must for the weekly lunch spot location. &#160;Do not be afraid of the line, especialy if you want to take it to go. &#160;These guys are super fast. &#160;Oh... and &#160; #14 (special) is great! oh goodness.i do not despair on wednesdays. &#160;i do not but i should... it is the first of my long, five-day work week and always a double shift, to boot. &#160;but NO! &#160;wednesdays at 7 pm i get mae phim takeout and take it back to my work and inhale the entire generous portion of utter brilliance in thirty six point four two seconds (or so), then lean back, and let go an extended, uber-satisfied "Unnnhhhhhh-hhh" while rubbing my belly--no, carressing my belly, as i would caress only something truly miraculous. &#160;like if they could cross kittens with pert bosoms. &#160;that would be magical, wouldn't it? magical not just for me and my caressing prowess, but for the kittens that get to be fused with the afore-mentioned pert bosoms, as they would never want for milk. &#160;think of the kittens. vote YES on initiative 145A, "state funding for kitten/pert bosom hybridization project"they couldn't poop, though. that would be gross. nobody wants to caress a poopy boob, silky or not! well, somebody might, but not me... that just not how i roll, baby.thank you,honest i.p.s. &#160;mae phim is good Best Hole in the Wall Thai Place in Seattle! I used to eat here 3 times a week for lunch, then I changed jobs. I stopped in 2 years later and the waiter goes "number 13, 4 stars?" GREAT FOOD and everything is like, $5. Oh yeah, it's only open for lunch and there's always a line, but it moves quickly. I'm really not a huge fan of Thai food overall. &#160;I think cocunut milk and peanut sauce are vile, which rules out a lot of dishes for me. &#160;I usually order the basil chicken and most Thai places do a really good job. &#160;Mae Phim is no exception (though not as good as Aroy Thai does it in Portland). &#160;For only $6 (incl. tax), I got a big plateful of rice, chicken, bell peppers, onion, scallions, and mushrooms in a chili sauce. &#160;I ate the whole thing and left feeling pleasantly full. &#160;The ratio of the various ingredients was perfect. &#160;On the spice scale of 1 to 5, I only got 3 stars, which was a big mistake. &#160;I don't know what I was thinking! &#160;I'll have to get at least 4 next time. &#160;I wish they had the pickled, sliced Thai chili peppers but I didn't see any. &#160;:( What to do:-Go with a friend. -One person orders the Mae Phim special. -One orders the Pad Kee Mao. -Share them. Perfect combo lunch! It's cheap, fast, friendly. &#160; Have been going there for 12 years now. &#160; Has never disappointed. &#160; Don't be a wimp, ask for at least three 'stars' (spice level). &#160; Only cudchewers from Flyover Country eat bland food! &#160; &#160;Call ahead and do takeout if you're pinched for time. &#160; SIX bucks including tax! &#160;Unschlagbar! mae phim is cheap, fast, and very tasty! not many places have a system as efficiently designed nor as productive as this.try their kao lao moo soup...also, you can order your food online: http://www.maephim.com/ then wander down to pick it up. Authentic, fast, CHEAP thai food in dowtown!It's very busy during lunch hour but come after 130ish and it should be a bit more calm. A lot of lunch goers do the take-out thing so it was a real treat to get a seat right away as we sqeezed &#160;through the rush hour lunch crowd.Had the curry and the boy had the panang chicken...he enjoyed his very much ( i would've loved to have tasted it but i can't hang w/the five star heatness!) and mines was good but &#160;I only asked for 1 star and it was still too spicy for me! &#160;Yeah, i'm a wimp! but i ate most of it cuz it was that good! Even though it gets pretty hectic in there, the service was still on point.
The main reason why I like Amante is the fact that it is open late into the morning. After having a few drinks at a welcome home party, I and some of the other partygoers needed some nourishment. After brainstorming what would be open after 1:00am someone suggested Amante. It wasn't frantic at that hour. Other drunks in search of food had not stumbled into the restaurant yet. We were seated quickly, ordered, and received our food in a timely manner. I split a pesto pizza with one dining companion and I was very pleased. I snacked on another's bread sticks which were hot and doughy. &#160;My only observation was the waitress was very apologetic about us having to wait. We were all a bit flummoxed since we felt we weren't waiting very long at all. I understand providing great service and making sure customers aren't waiting but you don't have to say you're sorry when there isn't anything to say sorry for. Amante is the place to go for last call dinner. Minimal wait and piping hot food. A winning combination! AMBIENCE - C- &#160;(hard to find parking) SERVICE - CFOOD - D (Eat here if you like SOGGY GREASY crust!)PRICE - B I visited on 2/26/12 after Oscar Party night to have a quick nosh... I was somewhat disappointed with the experience of a &#160;"slice" of &#160;pizza... we were seated promptly, however, &#160;the place wasn't busy, and let's just say it took &#160;while for service... for some reason we were an after thought after I noticed the staff just having around talking and goofing around &#160;... (15 mins. later) &#160; but once we got their attention then our server was friendly and came by frequently. How sad... we each &#160;ordered a slice of a pepperoni pizza - &#160;the pizza flavors are there with the toppings, cheese and tomato sauce... unfortunately the "bottom" of the crust was so greasy and soggy! &#160;... it's almost as if they let the pizza sat in a plate of luke warm greasy water before serving...I let my server and mgmt. know of the situation, and they did give me another slice... however, the 2nd slice just came out as "hot" greasy soggy pizza... don't know how they're making they're pizza here but it's not what I want to experience when eating. &#160; (I was informed they grease their pans before baking the pizza ... hmmm... they must be painting the oil on with a 16" brush!) I will have to say the $4.75 bombay sapphire martinis special (which mgmt. didn't know about when we mentioned we saw their sign special ) &#160;eased some of my pain and &#160;was a plus! &#160;... All I can say, if you like your crust SOGGY &#160;and GREASY... this is the place for you! &#160;... &#160;and perfect if you're drunk &#160;and need a quick bite and need to absorb some oil for a hangover &#160;... definitely &#160;this might be a place to eat if you didn't care what you ate. Absolutely awful food. &#160;Surprisingly the server was nice and friendly which made me feel terrible that she was working at that dump. We ordered a pitcher of beer, artichoke dip and a medium pizza. Pricing was inexpensive but the artichoke dip was like a pool of mayonnaise that had crusted over and the pizza was underwhelming and dry. &#160;We basically took a few bites of each and couldn't deal with any more. &#160;Not worth stopping by in even the most desperate of times. &#160;Trust me. I had a really bad experience with Amante when I tried to order a pizza on a Saturday night. I was told it would be 90 minutes to 1 hour and 45 minutes for delivery, which I agreed to. After almost two hours I had no word from them so I called. The woman I spoke with said simply that they had no record that I had ordered a pizza and was completely unapologetic that they had screwed up my order. After waiting two hours, and giving them my credit card information, I had no pizza and no alternatives. I would strongly discourage anyone from patronizing this business as they have very little regard for their customers. It's such a shame that Pagliacci doesn't have late hours because they are so wonderful to deal with and these people at Amante are so dismissive - what amateurs! This pizza was delicious at 3am. We got the "Seattle" and I liked how it had both red sauce and pesto, artichokes and sundried tomatoes. That was pretty cool (said in my best Miley Cyrus impersonation). But holy hell it gave me the WORST stomach ache, almost comparable to the Molly Moons disaster of 2011...So, I can't say that I'll be dining there again. Good in the moment. Bad on the toilet. Let's be honest. This place is a front for some kind of drug operation. How does a business this lousy still exist? With their obnoxious flashing LED sign, and the empty outdated booths, I can't see what would draw people to eat here. In fact, no one does - yet they still exist.One benefit is that they serve food late at night but so does Hot Mama's Pizza. I'll come here once in a blue moon but only to eat pizza and take it to go. At the very end of the night you might score with a discounted slice that's been sitting out or even get a free piece. But the rest of the menu items are almost all frozen foods you can buy yourself (for less) at a QFC around the corner. Can you call a place a restaurant if they don't cook the food there? It's more like a cafeteria or giant microwave. BARF. I wish other places would deliver late at night.The cheese has a texture like rubber and it's so rich that I want to vomit right after the first slice.Why must I always have to resort to buying this gross pizza? I went with a group of friends after a night of mass drinking, and there aren't many places open on the Hill that can help so it was a refreshing sight to see this place open.The service was okay. &#160;They seem a bit rushed especially at the after-hours bum rush. &#160;The pizza was pretty good, although not the best I've had. &#160;But when it's 3 am and you're drunk, it works.I do recommend going with some friends and sharing a whole pie or two, as their single slices were kinda sad. &#160;The breadsticks were good...and in some cases better than the pizza.Personally, it's good if you HAVE to have italian or pizza. &#160;Other than that, make your way to the 5 Point or even the Hurricane if it's after hours. Solid. Actually, the very first time I went to amante's I hated it. I ordered a screwdriver and the vodka was expired. i was also not impressed with their pasta salad. But, since I've given them another chance, I will give them 3 stars for the following:Amante is good Italian Delivery! The Formaggio entree is awesome and so are the calzones. They also have good coupons. Best dessert on the menu is chocolate cake...really delicious! I was visiting Seattle and my friend and I needed to get some carbs in our system before we ventured the bars. &#160;So we ended up here. &#160;He ordered the meat lover's calzone and I ordered the veggie calzone. &#160;Those things were freakin' huge. &#160;I swear it must have been a medium size pizza folded in half. &#160;It was tasty but I didn't eat the garlic in my calzone because there were literally 10+ whole cloves in there. Did not want my breath to be reeking when went out later...Other than that, the wait staff is really friendly. I've never ordered anything other than the pizza and a salad, and I've never ordered a drink here. Fair warning.I originally fell in love because it's pretty good priced pizza and they deliver until 3am! (Now they're open 24hrs so not sure if they deliver later than that, but still.... 3am!!!)The house special is LOADED with meat and veggies and is a pretty good price- under $25 for a large, but I still have spent way too much money at this place on my way home from drinking (I just moved in down the street...).The salads are overpriced. But delicious.Don't order the slices. My fianc&#233; loves them. They are greasy and the crust tastes like cardboard. Greasy cardboard. Just go with a few friends and order a whole pizza. I promise, it will be way more delicious. Why is it that the last four or five times I've stopped by here on a Friday or Saturday night, there is NO pizza available to be sold by the slice?!? &#160;If Amante is going to be open this late, they desperately need to be prepared for the post-bar rush at 2am. It happens every night. No surprises. The pizza is decent for an after-bar snack but the line is maddening and the service is lacking. &#160;The gal at the counter seems better suited for a tanning salon, not the rapid-fire front end of a restaurant. Gross Pizza. But the inside is comfortable and most of the other food is nothing to complain about. &#160;I enjoy coming here with friends or by myself for a quick bite and some reading or conversation.FYI--the service here sucks. &#160;You usually have to hunt down your server when you want to leave because they're not going to pay any attention to you once they've dropped off your food.I've tried tipping the ones that take care of me well, and giving less to the ones that are Morons-- and I would have assumed that,since I've been going there for 4years now on a regular basis, they'd get the hint...but no, &#160;the girls that are complete wastes of servers think I'm mean and the one competent server, a man, is usually the only one that takes good care of me...lame... Amante is pretty good. The pizza is good when you actually order it at the restaurant. I have noticed some inconsistency when you order delivery. Pricing is pretty fair. The space is pretty great, nice big booths with great people watching views. &#160;But the service is awful. The first time we stopped in it took 20mins for them to give us menus, in fact we had to go ask for service. The second time, the server was rude. She put our order in wrong and made our pizza for by the slice display so we had to wait 30 more mins for them to remake it. We ordered a half and half, half muchacho which comes with sour cream, when the pizza came we asked for the sour cream it came with and she didn't believe us. Glared at us and checked the menu. In that hour an 30 mins we were there she never stopped and asked us if we would like drink refills or how we were doing. Suddenly I hear this chipper voice behind us at the next table... " HI I'm such and such I will be your server tonight, what can I get for you?" Shocked I turn around oh I see it's a different server. Then the bill comes, mind you we are sitting pretty far from the edge of the table, I reach out to grab the bill folder and she puts it on the edge of the table out of my reach... well no tip for her and I moved all of the dishes as far away as I could from the edge of the table. HAHA! If you're going to Amante in search of pizza, it's likely that you were too drunk to make it over to Hot Mamas or Big Mario's (or so I've heard, it's still on my list to try). I'm not even sure I've even had the pizza at Amante. The Meat Lover's Calzone is where it's at. Bursting with heart disease inducing pepperoni, canadian bacon, sausage and crumbled crispy bits of bacon. Oh, and it's smothered with a thick layer of ricotta &amp; mozzarella with a piping hot pizza sauce. The crust is deliciously crispy and brushed with a bit of oil. Why is oil important? According to my boyfriend who considers himself a pizza connoisseur from his college days as a delivery boy, it allows for the maximum amount of adherence for the red pepper flakes. And for me, life without spice is a life not worth living.Best part: feeds two reasonably large appetites, comes with a sizable share-able salad (your choice of dressing, I vote Italian) and it's 11 bucks + tax + tip, breaking it down to about 7 bucks pp for a filling, reasonably tasty hot dinner. I love Amante's but I think I know why it has a 2.5 star rating, so let me say off the bat, this is definitely a place to eat and drink when you're already drunk. They have good drinks and a friendly bartender. Their pepperoni pizza is amazing, I think they put crack in it or something. Seriously, that pepp pizza is great. I had one of their other flavors (tomato basil) and it was really not good. But go for the pepp and you'll be glad you did. My review is entirely valid because I've given this place four chances.All the employees stand outside and drink and while I was ordering my take out one of them cam behind the cashier and started groping her. Awkward. &#160;I sit down to wait. &#160;And wait. &#160;And wait. &#160;Thirty minutes later I ask how much longer it will be - take note I'm sitting directly in front of the cashier who took my order...like ten feet away or less...no new customers since my arrival...- in response to my question "oh sorry...what did you order again?.....oh okay, they'll get started in that, it'll be about twenty minutes.". &#160; Erm, yeah, not an exaggeration and no, she didn't seem sorry at all. &#160;So I got my money back. &#160;All other times we visited the service was just as bad except we at least got food after a while. &#160;The time I ate in I had to leave my friends early and go home because I got severely sick.They just don't care so give your money to someone who makes an effort. It was late, we hadn't eaten, and pizza by the slice brought back memories of standing on the street corner and folding pizzas in NYC. Instead, I got a slice of lukewarm cheese pizza that made me want to start crying. I have ordered from this place 3 times and twice I have found hair/dirt in the pizza. It honestly makes me nauseous to think about eating there again. Also, no one is EVER in the place, there is something obviously funny going on besides pizza ... hmm Russian mob maybe?? One star might be too charitable. Delivery took a full hour longer than the originally quoted 45 minutes. Food had obviously been sitting since shortly after the time it was ordered. My friend paid 2.00 for extra sauce, which was forgotten, although, magically, she was charged. When she called, they said, "Are you sure you paid for it? Well, if we send someone out, it'll be at least 45 minutes." When she asked to be credited, she was told "We'll give you a free dessert next order." The girl finally took her name in order to credit her, but I doubt we'll ever order from here again. I should've heeded the Yelp reviews, honestly. I decided to give Amante a shot because I got one of their fliers in the mail with some coupons, and the menu looked appetizing. The pizza wasn't terrible, but the "Amante Special" was smothered in too many flavors that didn't mesh well together; it was covered in basil and onions, and you couldn't even taste the difference between the prosciutto and the pepperoni. I don't even think the olives were there, but that probably helped the pie, really.Also tried an order of penne with meat sauce, which you would think "Hey, how can you mess up penne with meat sauce? That's as traditional Italian as you can get." But you'd be wrong. The penne was very rubbery and firm, with very little sauce --which was pretty sour anyway. Somehow, even the cheesecake --which came free thanks to the coupon-- was incredibly dry and bland. I can't say I'd recommend it. This place used to be a great, reliable enough place for pizzas and calzones and salads. The staff was always a little idiosyncratic, but generally good enough that it didn't much matter. And, like other reviews said, it definitely helped if you were already drunk when you got there. Lately, it seems like they're hiring the spaciest people possible, maybe even going out of the way to hire people who've never actually been to a restaurant and have no idea what people who go to one might expect. I've had first-day waitresses for the last two visits. Tonight, I asked if it was happy hour. Her response was to ask me what time it was. I told her, and she said "Hm" and walked away. We never saw her again, let alone got an answer. After fifteen-plus minutes of enjoying delicious water, we ditched without ever having gotten the opportunity to order anything. &#160;This was not a surprise.Amante has occupied this space for a few years now, longer than the previous several tenants. If they keep with this bold downhill direction, I'm thinking that streak will be broken soon. Awful and disappointing. My GF likes this spot. I will admit all italian taste the same to me but for a woman who is 1/2 italian she loves it. What they lack in solid flavors IMO they make up with the fact that they are a block away and they also have a big size for calzones! A once in awhile spot for me. They are opened LATE as well. We come home late and order it. My ex-boyfriend loved this place - but the only reason I can figure is because it delivered late at night after he got off work. I cringed every time he ordered from here. The only good thing I can remember was once a fresh tomato, basil &amp; mozzarella salad - but you'd have to really work at it to screw that up.Seriously, I haven't eaten here since we broke up three years ago - and judging by the reviews - it's still exactly the same. Maybe it's better if you're drunk, or really drunk, because my ex always drank after work, he could put away a bottle of wine - so maybe that helps. Yes, get drunk first. Won't order delivery from Amante Pizza &amp; Pasta online again. &#160;Be careful when ordering online! &#160;So, I placed my usual order, that which I would have ordinarily placed for take out when I lived within two blocks of Amante for delivery, I even filled out the cross streets and double checked my address. &#160;45min for delivery, sounded reasonable, so I placed the order and patiently waited for my dinner to arrive. &#160;SO, an hour goes by and I decide that I should probably call and check on my delivery. &#160;The gentleman that answered the phone, (We'll call him "T." for Try Again), was initially helpful, he told me that the driver was on the way. &#160;Another 20 minutes passed before I received a phone call from the driver --- At an address very similar to my own --- but very far away given that it was my street address sans the direction. &#160;Which, if you live here in Seattle or anywhere around here, you know how important it is to get the direction on the street name. &#160;He apologized and said that whomever entered the address must have done so incorrectly and that he was on his way. &#160; I was a little taken aback, because I thought the "someone" he was referring to was me! &#160;So, I went back to my computer and checked the confirmation page -- nope, my address was correct with the additional driving instructions (cross streets). &#160; Hmm....what to do now? &#160;I know, I'll call Amante and see what's going on (mind you another half hour has passed since my last call and an hour and a half since my order was placed for a 45min delivery time. &#160;This time," T." again answered the phone, not quite as courteous (you could tell that they had gotten busier and he seemed flustered - no biggie, I've worked retail so I know business can sneak up on you. &#160;When I explained to him what had happened with the delivery, he repeatedly asked me for my address - I gave him the address and he said, "Ok, well we have it now, so it won't happen again." &#160;I was a little shocked and I reminded him that he had the correct address an hour and a half ago with the cross streets. &#160;He informed me that the website was not directly linked to their POS and that someone must have entered my information in incorrectly. &#160;I was shocked that he didn't offer some solution to the problem -- ie try to retain a customer - then I thought to myself, ahh...this isn't someone that cares about the business per se. &#160;So, I asked to speak with the manager. &#160;Sadly, it seems that he was the manager and really had no intention of trying to rectify their error. When I asked him if there was anything he could do about it, he said quite matter-of-factly that "We have your correct address now, so it won't happen again." &#160;I assured him that it would not happen again, as I would not be ordering from Amante in the future and hung up in frustration. &#160;After the next 15min passed, I decided I no longer wanted the food that was supposed to have been delivered over an hour ago! &#160;(FYI, clear weather, no traffic, Sunday evening and I live less than 10 blocks from the restaurant) &#160;I called back and "T." answered yet again, this time he put me on hold and never came back to the phone, instead a young woman got on the phone and I told her the situation and that I wanted to cancel my order. &#160;I was put on hold yet again. &#160;During the five minutes I was on hold the second time, my delivery guy arrived. &#160;At this point, I accepted the delivery and signed the receipt. &#160;The driver was very professional, actually courteous and had excellent customer service skills - had he been the manager his apology, demeanor, and explanation would have been more than enough to keep my business. &#160;But, "T." is the manager - I waited almost two hours to eat cold food that had dried out and crusted by the time I got it and got to pay the full $50(almost) tab. &#160;Maybe this is a new "manager" &#160;but he just cost them a fairly regular customer (I spent just over $800 at Amante in the past twelve months). &#160;IF YOU DO PLACE AN ORDER, REMEMBER:1) They may send your food anywhere in the city.2) "Approximate Delivery Time" means 2-3x whatever they say3) Do not expect customer service from the management4) Expect cold, dried out, possibly crusted food.5) Don't forget to tip your driver - he still has to go back to deal with the manager, at least you don't ever have to eat there again :) I always come here for cheap, it's-been-a-long-day-and-night happy hour. The food is aight and happy hour prices are reasonable. It's definitely a place to go to with a group for cheap eats and drinks. Staff is friendly and service is good. Never had a complaint there, but I also don't expect much when I go. The worst food ever. It was a last resort type situation but I think I would have preferred fast food compared to this garbage. The waitress admitted that everything was pre-made and not fresh. Jarred salad dressing, sauce and frozen produce. Stay away unless you are THAT drunk since they are open late!!!!! Ordered a pizza two hours before work, first pizza came and it was wrong, called and told them and confirmed exactly what we wanted on it. The second pizza came (now were looking at 1 1/2 hours later) and it was wrong too!!! Called manger and all he wanted to do was argue with me about how he made two pizzas and wouldn't give me my $45 back that I spent. Never did get the right pizza and had to personally go in to get my $45 gift card to a place I never want to go back to! MANAGEMENT IS HORRIBLE!! I don't hate it (the pizza), service is OK when the place is empty, and it is convenient.
I live very close to this location and have regularly ordered either the greek salad or pesto tortellini, both of which I have no complaints about, because it's a restaurant with a trashy bill board, so I only expect mediocre food. Sometimes the guy who answers the phone is high and forgets about my order, but it only takes 5 minutes to make a salad, so it's not that big of a deal. I've also had strong, cheap drinks and good service in the bar on an emptier night. &#160;After last night, however I will never order anything from Amante again. &#160;The WAITRESS WITH BLACK-BLUE HAIR AND BAD TATTOOS has absolutely no customer service skills. I ordered a house salad that is supposed to come with hard-boiled egg and roasted red peppers, neither of which were on the salad. She did not notify me of this, and when I politely explained this, she shrugged and did not offer to exchange the salad for something else or to give me a refund. I did not take one bite of the salad, and she gave me a 15% discount -- gee thanks.If you're going to serve shitty food, at least have good customer service. I live one block from the Capitol Hill Amante and used to go there often with friends or alone and was always treated well until one Friday evening about three weeks ago. I ordered a slice to eat while I looked at the menu. &#160;The manager Dimitri put my slice on a paper plate and sort of tossed it on the table in front of me. &#160;Shortly thereafter, he came to my table and pulled the menu right out of my hands.I was in shock over the way I was treated since I have been such a loyal customer and I tip 30%. &#160;I had been working in the studio for ten hours and had a little bit of clay dust on my jeans. &#160;I didn't feel like preparing something for myself because I was tired. &#160;But, after my experience with the manager I am not inclined to ever go back. &#160;I have also been telling my friends and neighbors about the horrible treatment. On a Saturday night at 8:00 a good restaurant will be packed to the gills, even in a recession. &#160;I called in an order for pizza after reviewing the flyer I got in the mail this week. &#160;When I got to the restaurant and walked in there was one table full and two of the employees wee out front smoking and speaking what appeared to be Russian. &#160;I waited for an extended time to even be recognized and finally a young lady offered assistance. &#160;$13.78 later, I walked out with a luke warm box I could have put in my pocket.The pizza was warm, not hot and looked as if someone else had ordered it and not picked it up. &#160;Flavor was very bland and the dough may have been good if it were fresh. &#160;Do yourself a favor and order Domino's or pizza Hut. &#160;I can't recommend this restaurant to anyone. With no immediate plans for lunch we found ourselves wandering around Seattle in the general direction of Top Pot on Summit. That's when we walked past Amante Pizza and had to stop in and check it out. &#160;You can smell the garlic from a block away.I got their lunch special, 2 slices of pizza and soup/salad. &#160;I had their veggie pizza, which was topped with ricotta cheese, fresh tomatoes, and spinach. &#160;The salad very fresh and a generous portion of romaine lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, sliced black olives, topped with shredded mozzarella cheese.My son had a calzone which was served with a small side salad. &#160;The calzone was so large it barely fit on the plate and made for nice leftovers.We also tried the feta fries which were delicious and not too greasy. &#160;The fries were square cut and delicately topped with crumbled feta cheese. &#160;Will definitely go back when we return to Seattle. The girlfriend and I were starving at 1am a few weeks back, so we decided to order from Amanti.15" pizza and one order of tiramisu (one of their signature pizzas with one topping exchanged and one topping added) was $37 and change.They were at the door in under twenty minutes.This was the first sign that this would not be good pizza.The crust was too thick and puffy, and, SURPRISE not cooked all the way through.The toppings were okay, but nothing special, but what really shocked me was crust accounted for a good 2.5" of the outside of the pizza.. meaning they were seriously skimping on the toppings. Tiramisu is $4 and change, so at $32 for a 15" pizza, I don't expect them to get cheap on me.They also couldn't hear me for some reason while I was talking perfectly normally on the phone, and yelled at me for it, then cut me off when I repeated myself and transferred me to someone else, who didn't speak discernable English. Awesome.Fuck that. The ambiance of Amante sharply contrasts with the rest of the local establishments on Olive. It kind of has more of a suburban restaurant feel to me that doesn't really complement the rest of the neighborhood; however, putting that criticism aside, the vegetarian pizza I ordered was actually fairly decent vis-&#224;-vis all the other mediocre pizza joints in the area. In general, I'm not impressed with any pizza I've tried in the Greater Seattle Area, but, compared to all the other options at my disposal, this place isn't any better or worse than any other run of the mill pizza joint. Like their stuff.. but they charge $1 service charge for to-go orders..and they say their Capitol Hill location is downtown.. LOL HARDLY.. Please update your website and prints... cuz you're very far away from downtown Seattle. So much better food in the city! When this location first opened, it was GREAT! I loved it. UNTIL. the meat sauce started tasting like chemicals and the side salads needing water wings to stay afloat in the watery mess of the dressing. They didn't receive my business for a few years now. BUT i gave them another change to get me a nice medium pizza delivered to my work Downtown. &#160;I ordered it online, as thier 45 minute delivery time was up I called to verfy if they received my order and the person on the other side got instantly defensive and started barking "it's not 45 mints yet" clearly it was, I had the receipt printed with the time and when the pizza showed up all the driver could do is bitch about the parking. I told him that I wasn't worried about him being late, and he told me "well i'm worried about my parking ticket" &#160;and the pizza warm at best and left me dissapointed. Ugh...why did I bother? &#160;Let's just put aside that my delivery order was WRONG. &#160;(Asked for creamy Italian and no lives on the salad...got olives and some sort of Balsamic-type concoction...no creamy-what-so-ever...) &#160;Got the baked fettucini formaggio--have gotten similar from other places (meatballs, fettucini, alfredo sauce + lots of other cheese). &#160;Except THIS one came with gorgonzola...thought it would be ok (have tried with feta and goat cheese before)--but noooo. This was like sour pasta sauce in noodles. &#160;yuk. &#160;The gorgonzola was just too pungent. &#160;Maybe they're trying to differentiate themselves from the other quattro formaggi's in the area, but this was an absolute FAIL. :( So, I've ordered from them a few times. The food's been okay. Expensive for standard pizza fare, but they deliver in my neighborhood.The last time it took an hour and a half to get food and they forgot some of it. Someone I called said they'd credit me the $ for what I didn't get. Later, I looked and my card wasn't credited back for the food I didn't get. Well, it was only like $3 so I decided to let it go. He also said he'd put a credit for something in the system, since it took so long, they forgot part of it and I was being reasonable and not asking them to bring it out on a rainy Saturday night. I call and order food again tonight. That's right. No credit in the system. But I'm hungry and order a pizza. Yep, an hour and a half later I call them. The girl on the other end of the line says to me, "He (the driver) came by there and there was no answer, I'll have him go back." It's sunny out! We've been out on the front porch and working in the front yard the entire time. This was a bold faced lie. I ask to speak to a manger, who of course, isn't there.My food arrives 10 minutes later. Under cooked and cold. &#160;They suck.
If you're in Seattle and in the mood for sushi, make it a terrific sushi experience with Umi Sake House!Umi is quite possibly the best sushi establishment in Seattle (definitely in Belltown). It's a super-hip, cool vibe that encompasses the essential elements of a true Sake House.I'm practically speechless trying to write this review right now. Everything is so good. Get rolls. Get noodles. Get Sashimi. It's all delicious!Recommended starters: Traditional Miso Soup &amp; Seaweed SaladRecommended rolls: Mr. Perfect &amp; 007Recommended drink: Tsuki Usagi Sparkling Junmai (1 btl/person)Tips: Call early for a reservation - it will be packed Thursday-Saturday. Call to confirm reservation.Take a cab - Umi is in Belltown and parking is a pain. The waiting area is very small - you may need to wait outside if it's very busy. I love this place. &#160;It's my favorite place to get sushi. &#160;Everything is fresh, the atmosphere is great, staffs are friendly... only thing I hate is finding parking in that area. &#160; My favorite thing on the menu is the "Street Fighter" rolls! &#160;BOMB! This is easily my favorite sushi restaurant, and my top 2 overall (with Tilth). &#160;My all-time favorite sushi of theirs is the mango/cilantro one. &#160;Definitely try the Windfall Winery Asian pear wine. &#160;It's delicious and went really well with the food. &#160;I've since bought a case of the Asian pear wine from the maker...turns out they donate all their profit to low-income housing in the area. One of my top three sushi restaurants in Seattle! Every kind of fish is super fresh tasting and premium quality! &#160;And I usually don't get rolls, but I recently went with friends that eat rolls and was really impressed! Far from traditional, but really great flavor combinations. &#160;Can't wait to go back and try the rolls again!If you want traditional Seattle sushi, go to Shiros, but this place is a little more economical and lively. If I lived in Seattle, I think I'd be a regular here!We made reservations on a Saturday night since it was Halloween weekend! We arrived a little later than our reservation time since parking was limited and each parking lot was charging an arm and a leg for a spot! We were very fortunate that the restaurant wasn't THAT busy when we arrived and we were seated right away! The atmosphere and vibe in this place was nice and we're definitely excited to see what the hype was about! What I recommend:- Panda Roll - My personal favorite, not only because I chose it but because I love smoked salmon. It may look intimidating because of the black sesame sauce, but that's their not so secret ingredient to make this roll good and stand out from others!- Butterfly Roll - Cucumber, Crab with spicy mayo, with a hint of cilantro wrapped with tuna &amp; avocado! The cilantro &amp; tuna is what makes this roll really different and good! - Belltown Barbie - I liked the seared salmon on top of the rolls!- Orange Crush - Another roll with a hint of cilantro and green onions! MUST TRY for sure!- Sashimi bowl - Came with two pieces of tuna, two pieces of salmon and two pieces of yellowtail.A little tip - Check them out during happy hour. Prices here maybe be a little expensive than other sushi places, but I'm sure it's worth it during their happy hour! Great food, good service, and hip &amp; modern decor for a group dinner! Awesome happy hour deals here.. although there are no deals on cocktails. &#160;I love the tempura plate (great bang for your buck), grilled garlic short ribs, and crispy shrimp (prawns wrapped in crispy fried noodles!). &#160;My cocktail, shisohito, was delicious too!Honestly though, I am not a fan of the upscale and "loungy" atmosphere when it comes to sushi. &#160;Seattle seems to love it! Very creative sushi. Super fresh fish and great combinations of flavors. LIke the food is good, it gets busy here so make a reservation. No problems here sushi is fresh and tasty. Can't believe I never wrote a review of this place.I've been here a few times, and the service is great, whether you are in a party of two at 5 pm on a Tuesday, or &#160;party of 12 at 8 pm Saturday.Great craft cocktails and delicious sushi!My go-to for Belltown sushi! Love Umi Sake House. Great rolls, great sashimi. You pay for it but it's good atmosphere, fish and service make Umi a solid pick for any occasion. Fresh Sushi, Awesome drinks, and beautiful ambiance! &#160;Can't ask for more! Simply put, the secret to a great dining experience with Umi is just to get there early (between 4p-8p), put up with the wait, and sit in the main dining area, not the front or back. Call ahead for a reservation if necessary--just don't go past 10pm though.For more information, please read on.You know how your parents will say your full name when you messed up? Well then...Umi Sake House! What are you doing?! Get your ass back over here and act right! Just because it's 10p at night doesn't mean it's quitting time!Look, you know I love you, but recent visits have shown me you get worn out and tired around 10pm. The waitresses forget some ordered items, so they're kindly reminded. The seafood is still very fresh, but the presentation gets sloppy (e.g. too much sauce added; rolls aren't as tightly wrapped; soup is lukewarm). Seating in the back area can provide loud and obnoxious neighbors and poor seating options; those red plastic chairs don't look very stylish and sit too low to the floor. The DJ will play some decent music and then just cutoff the song, completely killing the mood and taking away from any aura that remains in the area. It's just seems the staff can't wait until 11pm to close...even though they stay open until 2am?!Umi, you're very capable of much more. Trust me, I know.In the meantime, quit slouching, pull your pants up, and bring me the same A-game service and sushi you started at 4pm...even though it's 10pm! Come here for happy hour occasionally, and it's pretty good - sushi is okay and drinks are pretty good for the price. There are better sushi places in Seattle, n belltown is not so gr8 for parking The owners have done a good job of upgrading this place from its previous incarnation as the Bada Lounge. The food is not bad and it's reasonably priced but there are far better places to go for sushi in the area. It is a nice space, however, and if you're with a large group this could be a fun place. Okay, I get it -- it's a pretty good place for sushi. It's fresh, delectable, and who could blame the great interior design for creating such a romantic scene? Much more of a traditional Japanese vibe with a modern hype, I applaud this place for its sashimi and variety in selection of rolls to experiment with.Otherwise, eh. It's just a hype -- when it breaks down to the top sushi places in Seattle they all rank fairly close to each other. The tiebreaker is more along the lines of how great their happy hour menu is and by far, it's not this place. It's too limited to their small little miniature paper stand in the middle of your table.Dishes ordered: Casino Royale, eel roll, vegetable tempura, sashimi, shrimp tempura Solid sushi. But also solid wait times. &#160;Rolls are the name of the game here ... there's better nigiri found down the street at Shiro's. &#160;The black cod is also worth trying and the short ribs are delisssssh. &#160;I could munch on the accompanying taro chips all night. Susie Rosie will melt in your mouth! &#160;Definitely my new fav! &#160;Have been here at least 5 times now, and it NEVER fails to disappoint. &#160;Other recommendations:Hotter than Hell roll - feel the heat! &#160;This one is much much hotter than your standard spicy tuna roll.Ginger chicken is amazing, a little bit spicy. &#160;Any sashimi - quality of the fish is absolutely fabulous.Lychee sake martini...they will definitely grow on you! &#160;Happy hour - great prices, not to be missed.I have one complaint - the only room they have for parties will hold about 10-12 people. &#160;It is next to the bar, so you can't have any guests under 21. &#160;Unfortunately for larger groups, they are just not laid out well since that is the only good area for a party atmosphere. Sushi is pretty good. The sake drinks are pretty good, too. Some of the servers seem a little jaded, though. Maybe they have worked there too long? If service was a bit more personable and friendly, I'd give another star, but I doubt I'd go back there. Parking absolutely sucks, too! I wanted to surprise my boyfriend with a birthday dinner at Umi Sake House, a place he had never been. &#160;Problem was, I had never been there either! &#160;So I relied 100% on Yelp reviews and a recommendation from a friend. &#160;Thankfully, the reviews and my friend were right on - this place is beyond awesome!I made a reservation far in advance, since I'd heard it can get very busy. &#160;We showed up a few minutes early for our reservation and ended up getting seated right about the time the reservation started.Our table was in the very back room, which was thankfully much quieter than the rest of the restaurant (that place gets quite loud!). &#160;The seating was a bit awkward (as another reviewer said, kind of like eating dinner at your coffee table - low table and couch-like benches), but it worked just fine for sushi. &#160;To start, I had the Lemon Blossom Sake cocktail, which was super tasty. &#160;Very subtle on the lemon, but delicious. &#160;I liked that they brought us edamame as well - we were very hungry, so we quickly chowed down before ordering.It was hard to choose food because there are so many unique rolls! &#160;Their menu is huge. &#160;In the end, I had the Spider Roll, Avocado Roll, and a bowl of miso soup. &#160;All three were absolutely delicious. &#160;I wanted to order more, but I sadly didn't have any room in my belly!My boyfriend had a Spicy Tuna roll, Tuna roll, Tobiko roll, and miso soup. &#160;He loved all the food, particularly the Spicy Tuna and Tuna rolls. &#160;The service was outstanding. &#160;Our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly. &#160;Our water glasses were constantly being refilled. &#160;The food came out very quickly. &#160;I will definitely come back here sometime. &#160;It was a great experience, we had great food, and my boyfriend really enjoyed his birthday dinner. &#160;I'd like to come sometime for happy hour since the deals sound really good! I love love the ambiance and atmosphere here. Happy Hour is definitely way too good to pass up especially if you're with a group. There is a lot of choice on the HH menu and all delicious. The prices are soo good and the sushi and dishes are fab. As I am writing this review I am totally craving sushi and want to go right now. I think this place is good for big parties because in one of the middle rooms there was an engagement party and it looked everyone was having a good time with enough space to mingle.The setting, atmosphere, and how busy the place is reminds me of one of those posh sushi places in movies that take place in NYC or something...anywho yes 5 stars all the way! Happy hour here was quite nice. &#160;Tried the calamari, crunchy seattle roll, crunchy california roll, sashimi set, and seattle roll in that order. &#160;I'm no sushi connoissuer, but it all tasted great, and the sake (both chilled and warm) was a good match. &#160;Wish they would split checks and not charge a $30 minimum per person for large groups, but I get it. The place was pretty busy by the time we left around 6. I have been to this place many times but mostly during evening happy hours/dinner time (7-10pm). The last time I went with a friend on a Sunday at 10pm. I was surprised that there were so many diners who dropped by this place late at night to grab dinner here.The waiters/waitresses were always courteous and the dinner portion was good (not too big/not too small). &#160;We ordered volcano (baked salmon), agerashi tofu, tempura and albacore tuna tataki and total came to around $40. Not bad at all for the good food we had. I saw some people who came in a bit before their nighttime happy hour starts and the waiters were ok with customers sitting and waiting for happy hour to start ordering their happy hours dishes as well (they have happy hours from 4-6pm and 11pm-1am, with smaller dishes and drinks ranging from $4-$6.I have also gotten a take out order once consisting of assortment of 10-12 of some of their fancy-sounding rolls. My party didn't finish them that night so I ended up keeping leftovers overnight...They actually didn't taste as good, fresh the next morning/day anymore. So, if you ever want to savor the food here, it tastes much much better if you can just finish all your food at the restaurant than to take any leftovers home. rolls are best when they are fresh! Best sushi in Seattle, hands down. I've tried a number of sushi places in Seattle, and this one is as good as it gets. The rolls are incredible! I recommend the Dragon Roll and the Spicy Rainbow Roll, but any of them will thrill your taste buds. Their cocktails are also to-die-for. Very creative and unique drinks that go very well with the sushi. The sake selection is also impressive.Their Happy Hour is nice for cheaper prices on some of their more basic sushi, but there are no drink specials for Happy Hour. This place is awesome! The best place I've been to in Seattle, and I recommend it to all of my friends! Happy hour cannot be beat, and the crunchy Seattle roll is my absolute favorite. This place is fantastic!The sushi is always so fresh and delicious, and comes in large quantities for the price. The atmosphere is also wonderful, with nice lighting, and lots of wood and foliage. An excellent place for a great dinner.I would absolutely recommend Umi to anyone! Excellent sushi selection! Very well prepared and presented. Very nice wait staff. Would definitely recommend. Yum.This place definitely has some of the best sushi in Seattle, and anyone who says otherwise simply doesn't know what he or she is talking about. &#160;I will agree that some of the menu is a bit on the higher end of the price range for sushi in the city, but as far as the food goes, I have to give 5 stars! &#160;The happy hour here is a rockin' deal, and that goes for food and drinks.One thing to know about Umi, is that it is more of an upscale/swanky place compared to most sushi restaurants. &#160;If you are looking for a hole-in-the-wall, this is not it. &#160;That being said, the decor is pretty darn cool. Best sushi I've ever had, hands down. Try the sake martinis (I love the elderflower one). Definitely try the green decadence roll, crunchy Seattle roll, and the rockstar roll. If you like spicy stuff, the hotter than hell roll is great.Can't wait to go back! Umi has become our favorite Japanese restaurants. It is absolutely premium quality fish, and the most creative rolls one can possibly ever find. If you are a fan of spicy foods, they have the best Spicy rolls. Hotter than Hell is an absolute must have. For scallop lovers the Suzy Rosie simply melts in your mouth with flavor. the ginger chicken is amazing. Cocktails are the best and of course cannot go wrong with Japanese beer. It is a very extensive menu. there is always something new to try. Happy hour is highly recommended and if you are looking for a great place to have a party dinner... reserve the Tatami room. If you have not been there, it is an absolute MUST try. One of our favorite restaurants in Seattle. Oh and wait, the green tea tiramisu is super light, fresh and delicious. My FAVORITE sushi in Seattle. Best time to go is happy hour. The sashimi set is only ten dollars!! The cali crunch roll five dollars! So cheap and so delish. YOU MUST TRY THE MOONRAKER... best roll on the menu. I love their lobster bake, elderflower sake cocktail, and king crab tower. Parking is annoying, and I always spend loads of money.. but damn...it's good. This is probably my favorite restaurant! They have the best mojito I have ever had! The Crunchy Seattle roll is amazing as well as everything really! &#160;The atmosphere is just cool, I don't know how else to describe it! &#160;I highly recommend sitting at the sushi bar. Been here many, many times. I think I've lost count on the amount of times. Their HH is fantastic. People have their preferences, I am one who doesn't like raw fish, but there's always someone in my group that does. I cannot think of a single roll or dish we have gotten that was disappointing. There is another local sushi place that it seems people prefer one over the other. I prefer Umi, I do go to the other local one (we all know who they are) because I have a couple friends that prefer to go there. The difference in the two for me is I leave Umi feeling like wow, that was really good, to where when I leave the other place, I feel ehhhh, wasn't so tasty. So good! Love the atmosphere and the food! Happy hour is good prices too! All of the 5 star reviews here are true. &#160;Go here, order everything, you won't be let down. Very flavorful sushi and warm atmosphere. The butterfly roll was delicious! Only drawback was the noise level in the restaurant. It was pretty loud and I often had to shout with my mouthfuls of sushi, spewing rice and soy sauce across the table. Loved this place! They have some of the best hot sake I have ever had. The sushi was awesome as well. My wife and I ordered the Don Juan, which was a bit spicy with a nice citrus flavor flaver to it. IIRC, it had yellowtail and tuna in it. We also tried the volcano roll with baked salmon on top. It was delicious. I ordered the sashimi plate that came with salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. These were little slices of heaven. Would definitely recommend this place to any sushi lover. A bit on the pricey side though. Great sake- the hana hou hou shu (phew !! ) sparkling rose. Tasty crispy prawns appetizer and super-fresh, succulent spicy rainbow and sunset rolls ! We also got the tuna and salmon sashimi plate. The fish just melted in your mouth. Lives up to the hype. Super noisy though- don't come here for a quiet, relaxing night, or if you plan to have any conversation.
Umi is a sleek spot to eat some sushi and drink sake whether you're in a big group or looking for a table for two. The rolls are fresh and creative. Who knew mango and cilantro paired so well with tuna and salmon? I didn't until I chowed down at Umi. Not to mention the rolls are large and in charge. Two people could share one roll and leave satisfied. They also have a good selection of sashimi. For Belltown, Umi offers a mellow, hip atmosphere that's accommodating to a variety of occasions. Umi is one of my top sushi places! Staff is pretty friendly but could be a little more inviting! I come in often but still don't feel that regular welcome, &#160;besides a bit from James when I sit at the bar. Worth mentioning:casino royale- spicy tuna, avocado &amp; cucumber wrapped with yellowtail,lime, cilantro, shishito pepper &amp; jalapeno. This roll just melts in your mouth, I have to order this one everytime. The right amount of spice and tanginess!Happy Hour- 4-6 in the entire place, &#160;4-8 in the bar area, and &#160;even a late night happy hour. Most items are around $5 can't beat that for fresh fish! My fave is nigiri set b (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, albacore) or if your in the mood for something besides sushi spicy ginger chicken, or short ribs are pretty amazing also!The decor makes you feel like you are enjoying your meal outside, without the cold Seattle weather. The red plastic chairs in the back are a little tacky and not very comfortable. But the Heated Seats in the bathroom are a suprisingly nice touch lol. Definitely worth checking out, you will thank me later =) The first time I came here, Umi was brand new and it showed - no wait, quiet atmosphere, extremely attentive, eager-to-please waitstaff, and good food. &#160;We wondered how long it would take for this trendy little sushi pad to become too hip for us.The answer - a few weeks.So many moons passed and we'd go by it and say to ourselves "oh, maybe we should go to Umi for lunch/dinner/happy hour" but it was always absurdly full. &#160;So we ignored it. &#160;Forgive us, Umi.Which leads to us biting the bullet and going in on a Wednesday evening around 5:30pm. &#160;No wait - we were early enough to beat the massive crowd that came in about a half an hour later - and we were seated immediately in the large, loud dining room. Did I mention loud? &#160;I had to shout to my dining partner to be heard and he was sitting just across the table from me. &#160;Note to self - sit next to each other next time. &#160;(It just takes less thinking to sit across from each other - with one of us being a righty and the other being a lefty, we have to process the "who sits where" bit anytime we sit next to each other to make sure we're not spending the entire meal elbowing each other. &#160;Oops, I got sidetracked.)Turns out happy hour was still going. &#160;We considered ordering one of the sashimi plates off of the HH menu (a good deal), but the fresh list mentioned wild Coho salmon sashimi and well...who are we to go against what's fresh? &#160;We did order the ginger shortribs off the HH list ($5.50 for HH - usually around $10 I believe) and they came out piping hot and flavorful. &#160;A good balance to all the sushi we had.Miso soup had shiitake mushrooms in it, which added a good dose of earthiness to already tasty soup. &#160;The Coho sashimi was amazing - generous slices with a sweet and spicy sauce (that I ignored because the flavor was amazing by itself), and the two rolls we got (spicy rainbow and I don't remember the other one but the spiciness burned the living daylights out of me) were tasty and lovely.Despite the chaos and noisiness, the waitress was attentive, sweet, and very capable of hearing us. &#160;We'll return. &#160;If we can find a time when nobody else is there. &#160;(Or at least a few less people.)Only complaint - the rice wasn't what I wanted in the roll, but I am a snob. &#160;It's hard to find a place that has the right acidity in the rice. &#160;So far my mom's the only one who's achieved that. &#160;At least the rice wasn't crunchy, though! &#160;That's always an instant turn-off. START with 5 stars for taste and price. We ordered unagi rolls and there were 6 large pieces that tasted delicious. Their specialty rolls are good too, just don't get caught up in the names. [i.e. "Ooohh! Seattle CRUNCH roll??" &#160;Yeah, it's basically a philly roll that's deep fried.]SUBTRACT 1 star because we waited to be seated for a long time only to find that the restaurant was nearly empty. Now I know why the tables near the entrance were full.... to make it seem busy!SUBTRACT 1 more star because we waited about 20 minutes and no one came to greet us, take our drink order or ANYTHING. I had to flag down a hostess after she seated another party and told her we'd been waiting a while and were ready to order.... but no one came to serve us. She apologized and said she'd "yell at someone because we had to wait."SUBTRACT YET ANOTHER star because once our server finally arrived she failed to acknowledge that we had been waiting so long that we had to ask for someone to take our order. A simple "I apologize for the wait." would have sufficed. I guess they don't tell these people to be considerate...My boyfriend wanted to walk out [even after I asked the hostess to get someone to take our order] but we had already decided what to order when we were waiting for our table. It's a good thing we got some King &amp; I Rolls at Ohana because I would've walked out for sure! Oops, was that a plug for another sushi joint?....It hurts to give them such a low rating because I love their sushi but a restaurant is NOT all about how the food tastes; it's about the experience. This was in my Top 2 Worst Customer Service Experiences EVER [I'm sure I've had worse, just can't think of it...] and I hope someone takes over and replaces all the crappy wait staff with people who actually know what REAL customer service is. So I just flew into Seattle around 4pm that day and was starving to death so my friend took me to Wrap &amp; Roll. &#160;About 2 hours later, another friend invited us out to Umi. &#160;Initially I said I'd just go for drinks, but one look at the menu and well...needless to say I had 2 dinners that night.Food: A+ - So I had a miso soup, the spicy ginger tofu and the Spicy Crunch roll - tuna, creamcheese, asparagus (maybe?) and cruncy on the outside. &#160;The roll was delicious, i wish I had room for more. &#160;And that spicy ginger tofu was super truly spicy, I downed two glasses of water and my Lychee Sake cocktail to tame that spice.Service: A - Good server, attentive, and quick. &#160;No complaints here.Interior: A+ - Loved the interor, bamboo everywhere, can be intimate for dates, in fact, the seating was so intimate, I think we were eavesdropping on the first daters next to us.Overall: A - Next time I'm in Seattle, I'd love to stop by for a full meal. Happy hour! &#160;Happy happy happy hour!The happy hour sushi specials are simply fantastic. &#160;Unagi roll and bad boy roll were scrumptious and the spider roll was good as well. &#160;The warm sake was a little overcooked (too much water evaporation, leaving a very alcohol-y aftertaste), but for the quality and price, this happy hour definitely left my tastebuds dancing in happiness! &#160;Arrived around 11pm, in time for the late-night happy hour. &#160;Decent crowd, not too empty, not too crowded. &#160;Waitress was running around all over the place, but took pretty good care of us, checking in every now and then so definitely props for that. &#160;I think the place is open until 2am. &#160;In any case, yum! I have only been here once. I went there with a group of 23 for a birthday party. We had reservations for 8pm, but when we got there, they said the table wasn't ready. We had to wait about half and hour to be seated. Service was friendly and helpful once we were finally seated. People seemed to like their food and sake. I just got vanilla tempure ice cream because I had already eaten before going (thank goodness I did or I would have starved to death waiting to be seated). It was fine, but nothing special. I've heard good things about Umi, but I wasn't very impressed. It was decent and they were able to accommodate a huge group, but they should have planned ahead so that we wouldn't have to wait around forever (the reservation was made at least a week in advance). Umi is a great place to swing by, especially during their happy hour! Great ambiance, good service, and very yummy food!The ambiance is really nice and has a modern meets nature and you get this outdoor feeling. Romantic, although it can get a little loud. It is one of the few places I have found that you could go for a date and for a group setting. The sushi bar is a really awesome spot to sit at, especially to just talk with the sushi chefs!The hosts were ok, could have been a bit more inviting. That being said, the wait staff is fantastic. They are well versed in the drink and food menus and are really good at providing suggestions if you have an idea of what you want. The food is really yummy. Try one of their specialty rolls if it tickles your fancy. They are really good. I barely stick to my normal favorites when I come here, cause it just doesn't compare to the specialty items!Parking is pain, but let's face it...It's belltown for crying out loud! I usually don't eat tons of rolls or fancy sushi because I like sashimi in its pure, raw form. I give this place 4 stars because the Late Night Happy Hour rocks! (even though they automatically add gratuity).The rolls were actually quite light and tasty. They weren't drenched in mayo or teriyaki like a lot of other "japanese fusion" places. The prices are good - $4-9 for a huge roll (see pics) that are beautifully presented. The service was awesome - our waitress was so cute and helped us w/ directions. The happy hour cocktails were good, too....though, things got hazy for me near the end and my memory is a blur. I liked the lychee cocktail (see pic) - the huge ball of fruity goodness just sits in the glass, soaking up all the alcohol. Asian version of an olive, I guess??This place is fun. I always love izakaya-style places because they're down to earth and not pretentious. Mmmmmm, Umi . . .Went for Happy Hour; great prices on some sushi "staples" and sashimi plates. &#160;The bar was crowded, so our (rather large) group stood around a stretch of counter while some of us sat on barstools. &#160;They were really friendly and didn't seem to mind that we were taking up space in the walkway. &#160;After our entire group had arrived and we had eaten a fair amount of Happy Hour specials, we moved to a regular table so that we could try the more extensive menu of specialty rolls, and it was pretty darned amazing! &#160;Many of the specialty rolls are HUGE and well-suited for sharing with a group; a particularly amusing roll was the "Hotter Than Hell" roll, which one of the guys ordered on a dare--it really is spicy! &#160;My husband ordered the wild-caught Alaskan salmon nigiri, and it was melt-in-your-mouth perfect.I will definitely go back to Umi (in fact, I'm always bugging our friends to plan another Umi night), and definitely with a large-ish group--all the better to sample the menu with! This place was recommended by a local Seattleite so I knew I was headed to a good place.It's all about the Street Fighter roll, perfectly balanced cali roll (don't taste like no-imitation crabmeat here!) fully topped with tuna and 'seasoned' generously with strips of jalapenos...bad boy roll was good i hate to admit because i place much judgment on rolls made with cream cheese (due to my hatred for Philly/-esque rolls) but the cc was subtle and nice and melted. $30.Yes 30 dollars. &#160;That is how much it cost my girlfriend and I to have great Nigeri, 4 sushi rolls, and a flask of Sake. &#160;You can't ask for much more than that....but it also tasted great. &#160;Big rolls stuffed with fresh fish and other yummies made this my new favorite sushi bar. &#160;Of course you have to come for Happy hour (4-6) to get such a great price, but I would highly recommend eating an hour early to get this meal.Cheers to Umi! Lychee sake martinis + sashimi, sushi &amp; apps = happiness! My friend and I really enjoyed the food here and of course the cocktails! Those lychee sake martinis went down a little too easily and before you know if were on our third cocktail. The food is really fresh and we found it to very reasonable. It was pretty tough to get a table but we were more than happy to sit at the bar and enjoy the gorgeous bartender....okay maybe that was just me enjoying it. :) He was HOT! We tried a few kinds of sashimi, sushi and the Korean short ribs - all were very yummy. Seems like a pretty fun place to come with a group of people, HH, or date night. I'd hit it again fore sure! My first happy hour restaurant in Seattle! They offer a good range of items that are really, really affordable. Probably not the most authentic sushi place, but so darn good it doesn't matter! They have good spicy tuna here as well as their tempura rolls! Interior is nice and relaxing. I like the lay-out of the restaurant with an area lit with natural sunlight and another with ambiance lighting w/ lit candles. Cute date place or even if you just want to come by after work! The Seattle Crunch roll is great. Some people eat sushi to be healthy... and of course, I go for the wonderfully fried sushi rolls. OH well. The service was good, the happy hour deals are fantastic, and the decor is just awesome. I am a huge fan and this is one of the reasons I'm headed back to Seattle for the weekend. Not too pricey, excellent quality, and overall satisfaction :) This place was awesome!!!!!! They kept our reservation even though we were about 15 minutes late and it was PACKED! Then we ordered way too many items sushi and non sushi and our server offered to suprise us and bring it out in different, random courses : )The water service was fantastic, I was little wasabi happy so I needed it. I would say if you go you absolutely HAVE to have the Pretty in Pink roll, I don't remember what was in it at all but it was everyone's favorite. I went here on recommendations from fellow yelpers so thank you!!!!!!! I find it unfortunate that the best place I've found for rolls north of SoCal is all the way up in Seattle. I've been to a number of places in the South Bay already, and nothing comes close (granted, I don't usually go to places this pricy). The rolls at Umi are not only unique, they're all quite amazing. Went with some old college friends and we ordered (for rolls) the body of sin, ultimate dragon, tropical paradise, and the tarantula extreme, with the tropical paradise being the most unique roll I've ever had (a fish &amp; fruit roll? Who would have thought that'd be good).Food came quick, service was good, and the environment wasn't bad (although the central wooden room's wood smell reminded me an awful lot of urinals). Prices are quite high though, with rolls ranging from $10-15. With drink, two other dishes, and tip, the bill came out to about $47 per person. If only it were a bit cheaper, I'd bump this up to 5 stars. We came here based on the recommendation of my friend's bf, and we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!The sushi options are endless, but after much hmmin' and hawin', 3 of us went for 2 rolls a piece, despite our servers' warning that it would probably be too much for us girls. (For some odd reason, this seemed to be the recurring scenario on our trip. haha.) Either way, we all stuck w/ our original order and after what seemed like only 10 minutes max, were presented w/ a plethora of yummy, beautifully presented sushi! I can't think of one roll I didn't like. The First Ave Roll and 007 were the most memorable.As far as everything else went, the Ginger Sidecar I ordered was just ok and same w/ my Miso Soup. The sushi is obviously the highlight here! Service was pretty standard and ambiance classy.All in all, I'd most definitely suggest this place to any sushi lover living in/visiting Seattle. It's not to be missed! Yummm! We went here for happy hour and ordered off both the happy hour and the regular menu. The happy hour menu is small but the few rolls they have on there are heavily discounted. Once we were seated the waiter brought by some edamame. We typically order this anyway so it was a nice perk that it was on the house. The house sake I ordered of the happy hour menu was just ok, so after a glass I diverted to my plum wine standby. The rolls however were awesome! The Bad Boy (happy hour) was delicious and the 007 had a kick (take this with a grain of salt though if you like things really hot, because I do not so you may consider it mild). They also had a specials menu off of which we ordered the octopus ceviche. This was a really good dish I've never seen before at a sushi restaurant and it was great! I love the lighted atrium in the back of Umi. Something about the skylight and the plants always compels me to request a seat back there. It's a little more peaceful, as this place is delicious and therefore always packed and crazy! Beer, sake and Japanese food make me happy.I loved this place. This was my second choice while looking for Japanese food in Seattle. I'm so glad the first place rejected me (another review).I had the three day marinated black cod (very similar to miso butterfish for you Hawaii people), short ribs (korean style) and fried tofu to start. The fried tofu was a little disappointing as it didn't have a nice finish from the fry and the inside wasn't as soft as I like (didn't melt in my mouth). However, the short ribs were great (nice and tender, good flavor without being overcooked while it retained much of it's juicy goodness) and the black cod was soo soo good. Highly recommend the black cod for anyone who stops by.The sushi was pretty good. I had a couple different rolls (didn't order any traditional nigiri... just didn't seem that kind of place) The fish and ingredients was fresh. My only real criticism (and the reason why this place gets 4 instead of 5 stars) is that the rice was mushy and thus the rolls were falling apart. Rice is fundamental to sushi without which it just becomes... American. The flavors were good though so... to each their own I guess.Oh, good sake selection too!I would defiantly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good Japanese restaurant / Sake bar in Seattle. I haven't found a Sushi Place in the greater Seattle area that I don't like more. &#160;The 008 cannot be beat. I avoid Belltown like the plague as much as possible, but even an army of drugged out yuppies and scary bums couldn't keep me away from this place. &#160;This is my favorite sushi Happy Hour ever, and they have a fantastic blend of classic nigiri and rolls and experimental rolls (the Bad Boy roll is fantastic). &#160;My sake guru friend says they have the best sake around, and their beer selection is also fantastic. &#160;The service is hit or miss, it's usually very fast service even during happy hour and if you can ignore the painfully stupid conversations which often take place around you, then the place is absolutely perfect. Beer, sake, and good sushimi is an excellent way to start a vacation!We bumped into this place while wondering around on Thursday night, an hour after flying into Seattle for the first time. We were at first hesitant to walk in as the front room was empty while the neighborhood was full of life, however it turned out everything the actual place was located in the back. There was a wait on getting a table so we set and started ordering at the bar, where we ended up staying. The only downside was that the view behind the bar wasn't pretty (kitchen, and some other utilities).We ordered beer and sake (served by glass) and sushimi. The fish was great. Mixing beer and sake is bound to get one into great vacation mood. The bartenders were friendly and the crowd lively. Highly recommended for late-night good quality sushi. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Umi! &#160;I am a sushi snob and am never disappointed when i dine at umi, which is often. &#160;They have the freshest, tastiest ingredients in town and their happy hour is definitely worth checking out.Favorite roll: Casino RoyaleFavorite Drink: Lychee Sake Martini This place was great all around. From the ambiance to the food to the service, its about as good as it gets for sushi. The fish was very fresh and the rolls were big all for a cheaper price than I expected. While i was there i had 4 pc Uni which was great and it was on special. I also had the Flaming Tuna roll which I thought was very spicy. I'll be back here soon hopefully. Food- great!portions- smallwe went here for a friends birthday...the food &amp; sushi was GREAT.....but everything else that we ordered was small in portion...thank goodness i had a snack before hand....or else we would've ended up spending soo much more haha Whenever I am taking someone that is new to sushi somewhere, this is the place. They have exotic and fun choices. Lots of deep fried options, and who doesn't love crispy fried things? Some fruit options, and great cocktails. The service is fast and friendly, and the place has style! I love the bamboo walls, and stealthy toilets. On more than one occasion the server brought me back to reality after getting a little out of control on ordering. "You can always get more" they say, but I never can, they know best about what I can handle, and I appreciate them letting me know, instead of pad the bill with my lack of self control when face to face with a menu that brings me to my knees.The loss of a star is due to acoustics, it's near impossible to hear the person sitting across the table to you. Maybe it's all that hardwood that doesn't allow sound to be absorbed. I would gladly trade some fabrics added to the decor in exchange for some sound control. I usually don't like sushi places that carry lots of fried, complicated rolls, but I was happily surprised by Umi. The traditional sushi was pretty good but not the best I've had. I was happy about the large pieces of fresh fish, although I guess I imagined that the fish would be better than what I've had in LA, considering how good the seafood generally is in Seattle. I definitely wasn't happy about the fact that each sushi order = one piece of sushi at Umi. I've never been to a place where one order didn't mean two pieces.My friends all ordered highly creative, non-traditional rolls. Fried rolls, rolls with mango, rolls with chili peppers, rolls wrapped in crispy-fried noodles. I was surprised that I actually liked the ones that I tasted from my friends, and since the rolls were so substantial with all the heavy ingredients, there was a lot of leftover sushi after they were done, which just meant that there was more for me to try.It seems like Umi is a pretty hip, loud, nightlife-y spot too, which could have been sort of a turn-off for me, but since I was with friends, it wasn't really a problem. Happy hour is a steal but as with any good happy hour place, it's packed.If it's not happy hour, come prepared to spend some dough.I love the interior, all the wood and plants. &#160;The plastic chairs at some tables in the back room are kind of uncomfortable though. &#160;My leg fell asleep.As for the food, this is some of the best sushi in the city. &#160;And one of the widest selections of sushi rolls anywhere. &#160;Nigiri is priced by the piece.The Hamachi and Escolar are great. &#160;Rockstar roll is delicious but I try to stay away from the fried rolls. &#160;Off the latest special selections list I recently had a Street Fighter roll which was spicy and had lots of thinly sliced jalapenos on it. &#160;Their "Standard Roll" listing is a bargain. &#160;Unagi roll for $6 (or $7?) is a steal and so is the Spider Roll (it was either $8 or $9, can't remember).Inventive cocktails, including sake martinis in several flavors. &#160;I like the cucumber sake martini. &#160;And if you've never tried Yazi ginger vodka, this is the perfect place to do so. &#160;Goes great with sushi. UMI is definitely one of our favorite sushi restaurants in Seattle. They have an awesome happy hour and sake choices. Their sashimi and sushi rolls are great and always very fresh. The sake-tinis are delicious.And their garlic short ribs appetizer is awesome- and I don't even like beef! Great sushi happy hour. &#160;Reliable good fish and at happy hour prices you can't say no to like 5 plates.I like to meet up with a friend of mine after work and we always get a bottle of sake each. &#160;Sometimes two. &#160;Hey, this winter was hard. &#160;The location is great and the layout is very spacious and light. The service has always been fabulous. &#160;Courteous staff and they're quick. Umi has always been our standard girls night outing - when a girl friend comes into town, when a girl friend has a birthday party, when a girl friend has a break up, when a girl friend....well, you get the point. But we always come back because the sushi is amazing. The bad boy roll and the mango tango roll seem to always be the crowd favorite - it's inventive, fresh, and oh so yummy. The standard rolls are great as well for the rest of us "non-inventive" people that like to eat the same thing over and over again no matter where we are. And they also have the rolls that are anti-raw-fish friendly that also taste yummy for those that are still freaked out about raw fish. With such a diverse menu of equally wonderful rolls, you can see how it's a girl-crowd pleaser.It would be a 5-star'er, however, unfortunately just as the rolls are consistently delicious, the service is always consistently horrible. We always have to wait too long to be seated (sometimes they forget about you) so definitely call ahead and make reservations. We always have to wait way too long before our server comes by even just to greet us and take our drink order, where it's so long we've already figured out what we want to to order to eat - and that's a long time when there's 15 girls at your table. The food comes out in ok time, but then the check - getting the check is the worst. You come to the point where you start flagging down other servers, the busboys, even the chefs to get some service so you can just pay and get out of there. But despite the consistently terrible service, we always come back because the food is just too good...and just hope that it gets better each time. Umi Sake House has been a great replacement for Bada Lounge, which formerly occupied this space. The decor is stylish, and I especially like the seating area towards the back of the restaurant. It's designed to look like you're sitting on an outdoor patio, on comfy cushioned couches with a low-slung coffee table in front of you. They have a great happy hour menu, everything tastes pretty good and very reasonable prices, whether you're ordering from the regular or bar menu.The service is pretty good, as far as the waitresses. However, the hostess and management is pretty terrible. They're not just unfriendly, but even to the point of being rude. I've been here several times, and there was even one occasion where they charged us twice for drinks. It happened because we ordered a round through our waitress, but it never came after 10-15min. We then ordered it again when the manager came by. Of course, we only received 1 round, not both that were ordered. However, they put both on our tab. It was quite the ordeal to explain this to them several times, while the manager and hostess were just shy of accusing us of trying to cheat them.Bottom line, this is a good place to go with a large group, eat, drink, and lounge for good prices. Don't go here if you can't handle a few glares and rude gestures from the management. Before going to Umi, sushi was always OK by me, but I didn't love it. Umi changed that. I went there a couple of times for happy hour and was impressed by the quality and the decor. On a Saturday night we came in for happy hour. Happy hour wasn't going on, but it ended up being a good thing. We tried some of their more speciality rolls like the Panda roll. With one bite, I was in heaven. Now I crave it. The combinations, the flavors, the presentations. Perfect. If I go out to sushi, you will find me here. Unless your goal is the 6-8 PM portion of happy hour that they have in the front of the restaurant the way to go is sitting at the sushi bar. &#160;The sushi chefs are fun to watch and extremely helpful. &#160;They really like to please and will remember you if you visit on a semi regular basis. &#160;My girlfriend and I really only make it once every 3 or 4 weeks and the sushi chef is always excited to see us and makes us something special off the menu as an appetizer before we order. &#160;Little things like that can really make a place special. &#160;If there are more than two of you it is fun to order the omakase at a table. &#160;Always get something interesting that you didn't really expect. &#160;It's nice to have a little extra variety when you get something that you wouldn't normally order. I love Umi and Umi Happy hour. &#160;I don't always love the service when you call to make reservations but that's only on the phone. &#160;Once you go in, the hostesses are either very nice or just average. &#160;The waiters are very friendly and attentive though. &#160;Pretty in Pink rolls are the best. &#160;That and the tuna tataki are the main reasons I go to Umi. &#160;Also, they have a decent happy hour menu- bad boy roll, etc. &#160;This is not your typical Japanese food as it's very amercanized but good if you want to have some japanese fusion food. Fantastic portions at great prices! They have a good drinks menu with a friendly wait staff. Accidetally found this place on my trip to Seattle and and the wait was not bad at all without a reservation.The variety on the menu was impressive! And being from LA, the prices and taste were unbeatable. The Naughty Roll and the Seattle Roll were fantastic dishes, and so were the wines.The atmosphere was great for our group; made it light, fun and social. Might be a little boisterous if you're looking for a more intimate setting. Otherwise, this place is fun, delicious, and price-savvy as far as sushi goes! I'm definitely a fan of this belltown hotspot. I love sitting in the Tatami room or the back side of the restaurant that has benches and has a little lounge feel &#160;Top faves: &#160;The Legend of Rolls (has scallops that are torched!), &#160;Chilean seabass with spicy tomato glaze is also a winner. &#160;If you can squeeze in for happy hour, there are great deals on sushi. &#160;I think UMI is a good alternative to bar hopping in Belltown - food is decent, sake cocktails are fabulous and scene is always hip especially on Friday nights. Came here on a Saturday night with the boy. Wait time quoted was 15-20 minutes, we ended up waiting for about a half hour. It wasn't too bad, though, as we ordered a bottle of &#160;"White Crane" sake for the wait. Tasty! We were sat at the bar, as the boyfriend wanted to watch the chef make sushi, but were asked to move within a couple of minutes as a party of four wanted to sit at the bar as well. Our new spot didn't have a view of the sushi chef, but we were moved again to a table (because why bother sitting at the bar if you can't see anything?) without any trouble. We had the 007 roll and some crazy roll involving mango sauce... amazing! The rolls were huge, fresh and the flavors mingled on the palate so well... now I'm nostalgic. They seemed a little understaffed for a Saturday night (it took our server 15 minutes to bring us a dessert menu) and it's a bit pricy (but it is Belltown) but for the variety of sake and the deliciousness of the sushi, we'll be back.Their happy hour is an amazing deal, and they don't compromise on the quality of the food - but it gets packed, so get there early! Seattlites can be so pretentious about their favorite Sushi restaurants. &#160;They wouldn't be if they all tried Umi. &#160;I went here on a date. &#160;The date was awkward, to say the least, so it's a good thing I had Umi's massive menu to preoccupy myself with. &#160;We sampled four very different rolls and they were all melt-in-my-mouth fantastic (unlike my date...). &#160;I was ready to call it a night, but then he ordered Sashimi for me. &#160;Right away I was hooked. &#160;I would go back to Umi everyday if I could for how fresh and tender the fish was. &#160;I completely agree with Jiyoon that people have to understand how sushi is made...and Umi definitely does it authentically and extremely well. &#160;Downfall: &#160;They server avoided us like the plague. &#160;We actually had to go and find him after ten minutes of him never entering his section. &#160;He must have been weirded out by my "friend" as well... &#160;Anyway, I would actually give Umi 4.5 for that minor detail. Good for hanging out with the fancy people and getting creative "party in my mouth" rolls. &#160;Good sake selection and the waitstaff if pretty decent at helping you make a choice based on what you've liked in the past. &#160;Nice decor with a variety of atmospheres based on the section in which you are seated... Bar area, "patio" area, traditional dining area and a small semi-private room for a large party. Let me start off by saying I am a sushi snob. &#160;When you've had fish that's been caught, sliced and served while on the boat, 20 miles off the coast of Tokyo - you tend to be pretty picky. &#160;That said, for Seattle, this is the best sushi I've had since moving here in June. &#160;I won't go into specifics but the rolls were great, the service was impeccable (I love it with sushi especially, when they check back multiple times, clear plates, etc) and the ambiance is neat too. &#160;Could have thrown some water in a few areas with maybe some fish swimming around (I mean, it IS called "Umi" - which means "beach" or "sea" in Japanese) but I go to restaurants to eat #1, then to check ou the decor. &#160;Overall, A+, we are most definitely going back. so what if i have my boyfriend take pictures of me pretending to eat my food. i was a visitor from San Francisco and needed new facebook pictures, duh. i liked this place because it's cute, hip, open late, and has a young staff who are nice and helpful... but then again, i noticed that pretty much everyone in Seattle are kind. but ew. why would you ruin my awesome dining experience i was having by giving me a hella soggy yellow tail Samurai roll? that was not cute at all. the rice was mushy and fell apart every time i tried to pick it up. cause of that, i had to knock down the 4 stars i was going to give, down to 3. I really enjoyed this happy hour! &#160;Even with our large group, it was still pretty quick service. &#160;4 out of 5 because when I'm done eating, I like to go away.. I don't want to sit around and wait for my credit card to be processed.... &#160;I tried the "Seattle Crunch" and let me tell you.. YUM and my cocktail was pretty strong too! &#160;YAY! I have only been here for the happy hour sushi but I loove it. The rolls are great, the nigiri is so tasty, the service is quick and friendly. If you order only from the happy hour, you can get very full for very reasonably priced. I couldn't say enough good things about this place. If you like sushi and Happy Hour, then go to Umi for both. &#160;It's inexpensive and the rolls are really good. &#160;I happen to looooove the crunchy california roll. &#160;The drinks are pretty good too. &#160;Not weak. This is not a joke. &#160;I do not like sushi. &#160;I do not like fish. &#160;I do not like seafood. &#160;Umi Sake House, is in a different category. &#160;This place opened up my palate to the world of raw foods. &#160;I cannot lie; I hated seafood/fresh foods. &#160;Umi added flavor to everything I hated. &#160;I now can eat at Umi every week; in fact, I have on many occasions. &#160;It is that good. &#160;Yes, I said it. &#160;Go here. &#160;Enjoy the food. Do yourself a favor. This is the best sushi I've ever had but its also the first time I've had west coast sushi. I ordered way too much sushi with each order containing 8 rolls. Having sushi of this quality is a good and a bad thing because from this point on I will be comparing it to the food I had here. Perhaps I should move to the west coast just to experience this quality of sushi all the time? I might be biased as I live a few blocks away so it's an easy spot to grab sushi whenever I have a craving...which is all the time. &#160;It is crowded quite a bit &amp; if you're headed for dinner, it's best to make a reservation, but the wait for a happy hour table is usually not too long. &#160;Service has always been great, but then again, I just require the waiter or waitress keep the drinks coming (and the drinks are delish! &#160;They are evil in a glass, they're so yummy, you forget there's alot of alcohol in it - get the lemon shisohito if you like mojito's...you won't regret it!). &#160;Cooked food is pretty good, but the sushi is great. &#160;However, my opinion on that should be limited to traditional rolls &amp; sashimi. &#160;I might try a "specialty" roll on occasion, but invaribly I regret ordering it (guess I can't help feeling that sushi should taste like fish &amp; rice minus the cream cheese or mayo). &#160;Main reason why I liked Umi was that the quality of the fish was excellent and they had a very extensive sashimi menu. &#160;Aside from that, the decor is lovely, great place for a date or a group. &#160;Happy hour shouldn't be missed. &#160;They have extended happy hour in the front and the bar area till 8pm. &#160;Only sake &amp; beer on the hh menu, but a decent sushi/sashimi menu...in addition to the usual stuff like tempura, calimari, etc...fyi, the asari miso soup is really good if you like miso soup. &#160;1 last thing...price is what you would expect from a belltown sushi joint. &#160;Bring your charge card. my first real sushi experience. not because i don't think i would like sushi, but because i'm a carnivore and tiny rolls of rice and fish isn't the first thought i have when i'm starving. my bro swears this place is one of his faves. we walk in and the place is exactly what i had imagined. modern design. deep rich colors, and wood accents throughout. we order the calamari to start, and lemme tell you...it was sooo good...i could have eaten that dish alone as my meal. the fried rings were lightly seasoned with a spicy sweet sauce and accompanied by a perfectly dressed salad. we ordered the 007, which had spicy tuna, salmon, cucumber, and lime. it wasn't my fave, i think it was because of the overwhelming flavor of lime. don't get me wrong though, i love me some lime. the casino royale had a similar flavor, again the lime was killing it. my bro raves about the seattle crunch, which has salmon and avocado and is fried. very good and because its fried, it had a interesting texture. We just got into town, and were strolling around Belltown when our friends suggested we hit this place up. &#160;After about a five minute wait at the bar, we were quickly ushered to our table located on the indoor patio. &#160;Since this was first time dining at Umi, I deferred to our friends when it came to making food choices. &#160;The decision; Agedashi Tofu, and several signature rolls. &#160;All were great, but the gem of the night was the Agedashi Tofu. &#160;This is a must have in my book if you are to dine at Umi. &#160;The service was friendly, and always quick to answer any questions about the menu. &#160;Clientele ranged from trendy youngsters to the after work business crowd. &#160;If I lived in Seattle, I would definitely put Umi into the rotation. &#160;Great place to grab a drink, start a night with a roll or two, or hit up on the late night when you have that little sushi craving. Unbelievable. This was the best sushi that I've ever had in my life. We were in Seattle for work and happened to stop by this place for dinner. Would definitely recommend the toro. Definitely not traditional Japanese - large rolls with mango, avocado, lemon jalapeno sauce, and even strawberries. &#160;The mango tango roll is good, as are some of the salads. &#160;Food is fresh tasting; sake cocktails are also fun. A favorite Belltown hangout. &#160;I liked it as Bada Lounge before and like it better as Umi now. &#160;Nice sake selection, but unfortunately they only have Otokoyama in the big magnum size for like $120. &#160;That didn't stop my group from finishing off 3 of them though. &#160;oyster shooters are awesome and only $2. &#160;Cody, one of the owners, is a great guy and can frequently be seen smiling and mingling with customers. &#160;Some of the maki sushi can be off-putting for sushi elitists because they're kind of americanized, but they also serve all the traditional Japanese sushi... and if you get upset about deep fried maki or maki with fruit, then you either should pull your head out of your ass and chill or go to Japan and cry over there about how impure American sushi is. THE BEST SUSHI I'VE EVER HAD. Hands down. &#160;Just throw a Bad Boy &amp; Crunchy Lizard roll my way and slip me a couple Lychee Lemonades.. I'll be the happiest girl on this planet. &#160;The service brings the rating down though. Our server told us once that if there are 5 adults and one baby she would tack on the gratuity. What?! The baby didn't even eat!! But the head chef from umi is now at Japonessa. Food is just as good, happy hour is almost all day and the service is awesome! I love Umi. &#160;I'd eat there every week if I could. &#160;Great food, good drinks, great happy hour, cool space. &#160;I love the filet mignon, Cali Crunch roll, and chicken yakitori... &#160;So good.The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of some issues I've had with service - I live in the neighborhood and often like to order takeout to go pick up. &#160;According to their takeout "policy", the only nights they won't do takeout are Friday &amp; Saturday, but there have been several times I've called on a weeknight to be told they are too busy to do a takeout order, which is disappointing. &#160;Do it or don't - pick one and stick to it.Other than that, love this place! As many others vouched here, the sushi and sashimi are good. And they are good in many places. What I come *here* for are: lychee sake martini and hirame no usuzukuri. Great happy hour and great drinks! :) Their indoor courthouse seating makes for a great hangout with friends. I love that their happy hour runs until 8pm in the front. You can't go wrong with their rolls - they're very good. happy hour sushi is delicious and great value! when i go out to eat sushi / japanese, i always expect to pay at least $15. it was great getting the check and only having to pay $10! =)unfortunately, we snuck a peek at the regular menu, and all the good (and more expensive) stuff was on there. =(but service is good, was still able to get seating during happy hour around 6. and sushi tasted fresh. you can watch them make it while you wait as well! Great Sushi place. &#160;The 007-9 are recommended. Soooo happy to find a new sushi spot downtown!!! &#160;Umi is fantastic! The service was quick and friendly (though they get one star taken off for the hostess' who weren't as great as the rest of the staff). &#160;The bar service was pretty standard. &#160;They have an excellent selection of sake and their specialty drinks were very tasty. &#160;Try the lychee lemonade, it's delish. &#160;A friend and I ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was probably one of the best calamari's I've ever had. &#160;The breading is light and tasty and the sauce they put on it is to die for!! &#160;The restaurant also provides a little plate of edamame free of charge which I like as most sushi places have it as an appetizer you have to pay for. &#160;My friend and I split two rolls, both of which the menu had indicated would be spicy, and to both of our delights truly lived up to our expectations. &#160;The service was uber fast, we had our rolls before they had brought out our calamari. &#160; I will definitely be going back to Umi very soon and bringing all my friends with! i love umi, especially for happy hour after a long day at work -- it's perfect! fast service, great food, and drinks @ about 5each, not frickin bad! Ok, so the reviews I've seen say that this is the place for rolls so I stuck with them and wasn't disappointed. I want to try the Bad Boy roll now though since so many others liked it and their sashimi. Loved the service, ambiance and happy hour prices! Seating was tight but I still felt like it was fine because it's loud and people are doing their own thing. Not such a fan of the sake, what can I say- I'm a beginner... Great place to go if you're going to Key Arena too. Great sushi, great drinks, great prices, great atmosphere!! Wow! &#160;My husband and I eat a lot of sushi and this was by far the best we've ever had!! &#160;The service, sashimi, the oysters, the special rolls were all so delicious! &#160;We're probably going to go back again before we go back home! If you can stand the wait (and wait while standing) Umi has an awesome Happy Hour. The bar area is very small, so if you don't have a reservation be prepared to drink standing up while hovering with 10 or so others for bar stools to open up. If you're going to eat, though, get your name down for a table up front.For a roll-based menu the sushi here is great. I prefer nigiri but I'll eat a spider roll or a nice spicy tuna, and the latter is usually on special at happy hour. The service is friendly if stretched a bit thin when crowded - they're not slacking by any means. While there are places I would go that have a less crowded happy hour (The Bridge) or better sushi (Ohana), Umi definitely has its place in my rotation. Umi is wonderful! Jose the head sushi chef is an unbelievable chef who will make custom dishes that are unique and he brings a spanish flavor to his sushi! I seriously recommend this restaurant! Great happy hour with cheap sushi and sake and beer. &#160;The staff can be hit or miss. &#160;I have personally always had a great experience but I've heard stories from others. &#160;Be prepared to wait as it is very popular and very busy for happy hour. &#160;Just go early. This review is SOLELY based on customer accommodation. &#160;I'm an avid fan of Umi and their food. &#160;Their service has been a little above average with the occasional super friendly server. &#160;So, I was a planning a little party for a Sunday night at 7:30p. &#160;Sushi party! &#160;Who doesn't love a sushi party? &#160;I know it can be scary for waiters and waitresses when a big group of people come in for dinner (about 35 for this get together). &#160;Stipulations? &#160;24-hour cancellation fee of $100 - understandable. &#160;Minimum requirement for our part to spend $1200. &#160;On FOOD only. &#160;That's $30 per person. &#160;Sure, I can eat $30 worth of sushi, but we all know not everybody can. &#160;Plus, what if a couple people can't show? &#160;We're still obligated to spend $1200. &#160;Again, on JUST food. &#160;Really? &#160;I try to negotiate, asking if that $30 per person can include drinks...because then we can definitely make that price, if not more. &#160;No deal. &#160;The lady I talked with said that their prime hours for dinner is from 6 - 8pm and they need to make sure they meet their quota for those hours. &#160;Reservations are for 7:30pm. &#160;30 minutes left in their "prime dinner hours." &#160;Hm. &#160;I was given the option to push the time back to 8:30pm, but we would still be obligated to pay $20 per person, again on FOOD only. &#160;Although it is more reasonable and can likely be done, I'm already put off on the fact that they gave us a price we had to meet. &#160;So Umi Sake House, acommodate 40 people for dinner that would have likely spent over $1200 on food and drinks or not? &#160;They chose not. &#160;Sorry Umi, you just screwed yourself out of 37 new customers that may never bring their $$$ to your restaurant and 3 customers that may not be highly recommending you again.
Late-nite munchies led me here. I kind of wanted to try something a lil' different, but safe. When I saw the fried stuffed tofu, that sounded great... but for a spin, I went for the steamed stuffed tofu. Now, it wasn't stuffed (the shrimp paste patty thing was on top of a block of soft tofu), but it was ok. 8 pieces in an egg white(?) sauce. Some dashes of pepper and salt helped give it flavor to send 'er down. I also got something to-go: Some special on the chalk board - Chicken &amp; Roasted Chestnuts (nice cursive, btw!). This was very good, but the ginger chunks were a bit overwhelming. Maybe they can, or you can ask them, to slice the ginger finer. Otherwise, pretty good stuff.PS. Warm, roasted chestnuts are awesome! A bag from the Uwajimaya cart is a great snack. Best Dim Sum in Seattle!!!Lines are always long on the weekend but it is definitely worth it. I usually call ahead so they can put me on the list and by the time I get there I usually am always next which is nice. The regular food here is yum as well. It is extremely funny how there are so many reviews. I come here, their food is kind of dirty and not really worth it. Super crowded, you can ditch the bill easily. The best dim sum place is Dim Sum King FTW! I mean who can beat this a ham bao for only $.60?! and most of there desserts are $.60-.75 cents each. and definitely worth it!!! If you have to eat here, you better call to make reservations. We had to wait about AN HOUR &#160;to get a table for 2 while they were taking reservations on the phone. (I don't even know why we waited the hour, all I can say is, at a certain point, reason goes out the window and desperation sets in).After all of that, I was underwhelmed by the dim sum. The hai-gaw was big but not very tasty, the ham sui gok was very cold and only tasted average. The best dim sum out of the bunch was the siu mai.Aside from the food, the servers were quick and friendly. I love me some dimsum! This review is for Jade Gardens Dimsum, I've never been there for anything else but dimsum. You have been warned =P. Also the waitresses can smell a noobie! So be confident when you order or you'll end up with a "special plate" and you won't even know what hit ya!Surprisingly for me great dimsum is actually pretty hard to come by. In the International District there's only a handful of places I eat dimsum at and Jade Garden is more or less our go to. It's good dimsum, it's not amazing but it's pretty consistent and that's important as well. Located right in the heart of the ID, Jade Garden on the weekends and even some of the weekdays for lunch can get slammed with a huge line of people waiting to be seated. It's primarily because there's not much else to choose from around the area. My recommendation is to get there early and put your name down. Don't ever show up later, that goes for ANY dimsum restaurant. Because towards the end of dimsum they don't make anything fresh anymore and they just cycle the old stuff no bueno. They do a good job cycling people in and out of the restaurant. They always have a large staff to handle the number of people that come. The restaurant itself is actually very large. There is a whole back section that a lot of people don't know about so this is definitely a good location to handle large groups. Food...they are consistent. I wouldn't say anything is better than somewhere else. Most everything as long as you are there during the peak hrs is fresh and hot when served to you. Like any good dimsum restaurant the waitresses are always trying to push the large plates on you, Jade Garden is no exception. They see folks that come in that they know aren't familiar with the dimsum process and they will bombard you with plates that are more expensive and aren't really your typical dimsum dishes. This is to those that are just trying dimsum out for the first time. DO NOT HESITATE TO PUSH BACK! You don't want it just say no, don't hesitate cause they will keep asking you because they know you will feel obliged to take it. It's ok your not being rude it's part of the experience. You want something you need to pipe up and ask for it, don't whisper, you see a waiter wave them down you aren't being rude. Also be prepared to share a large table with 1-2 other parties in case you show up with just 2-3 people. Again all part of the experience. So Jade Garden, does a good job with their dimsum go give them a try just get there early to avoid the lines and to make sure you get the fresh stuff =). I've been here twice now and have to say it has made me love dim sum. I had never had dim sum before coming to Jade Garden and I had no idea what it was.They don't take time to explain it to you here. Bustling toward you with carts full of food, men and women will stare at you questioningly asking if you want some and it's a risk you have to be willing to take.I really enjoyed their barbequed pork in dough balls, but most of all the pork in the pastry is the best. Also, their chow mein is not greasy at all and my favorite side dish to order. The staff is very accomodating when you need something but they certainly don't go out of their way to tend to you.This place is crazy cheap too. For a ton of food to fill two people, out the door is about $20. That's how much one entree costs at Cheesecake Factory.You can park at Uwajimaya and make a minimum purchase there because parking is kind of tight around ID. But it's also walking distance from the bus station so that's an option.Also-there's a bathroom in the back of the restaurant. They say on the door "no public bathrooms" but there is one for guests. It's very rare for dim sum to be anything more than average for me, but it does happen from time to time. Unfortunately, this was not one of those times. Stopping in for lunch one day with Natalie N, we ordered a slew of typical dim sum dishes that I no longer remember, except that none of them stood out in any way.They're actually on the low end for dim sum places that I've been to, but they're not terrible. And when we showed up at least (lunch on a weekday), the place was fairly empty, which is certainly a welcome situation. I came here for lunch today and the place was packed by the time we left and it wasn't even close to noon yet. If you come, be here before the lunch hour otherwise you will have quite a wait. I was surprised at how busy because the quality of dim sum could have been better, but it was very average. I probably could have maybe gave them a better rating, but we only tried three different items between the two of us. Oh well maybe next time I will come with a bigger group so that we can try some different items. They did have a lot of variety on the carts so that is something to look forward to next time.I do have to agree with a lot of the other yelpers that this is a cheap dim sum place and you do get your money worth. Plus the service was quick and attentive. #DimSum This review is for their dim sum only....Cause their dinner is 3 stars and nothin to spell about. No worries just do dim sum. Also this is Moms favorite spot.Jade Garden is Seattle's dim sum champ. &#160;Freshest, tastiest, warmest, and most extensive dishes. My joints are the hai goh, shu mai, shrimp and scallop dumplings, chinese donut wrapped in how fun, shrimp and crab dumplings, dim sum size chinese brocili, bbq how fun, sticky rice in banana leaf, chicken feet, spare ribs, and any randon intriguin creation.The joint is hella crowded and waits could be around 30-45 minutes on weekends. &#160;However is a pretty large space with seating in the back and upstairs. You will wait at Harbor city as well, so why not wait for something better. Smaller parties maybe sharing tables like NYC chinatown style. Ambiance is typical Chinese restaurant, dont expect too much. Thank Me Later.. After an awesome dinner at home with the fam on Christmas Eve and a million dishes later, I convinced my parents to go out for Christmas lunch at a Chinese restaurant...and this is where we ended up. I've rarely been to the International District with the exception of Green Leaf...but this place seemed pretty solid and was PACKED. There were 6 of us and we managed to get a table in less than 10 minutes despite the fact that the entire restaurant was full. We had no idea how much food there would be so we each ordered an entree and shared what we got. First off, we didn't do Dim Sum although I know that this is what this place is known for. It looked pretty good though, I'd come back to try it. Secondly, we did not realize that the portions here would be HUGE. Which they were. We started off with a hot and sour soup which was really good - they gave us a huge bowl and then we shared it. There was more than enough for the 6 of us with seconds all around. We then ordered a ton of entrees - pork fried rice, honey glazed short ribs, shrimp fried rice, special beef, chicken and broccoli, and moo shu pork. While I didn't care for the honey glazed ribs and didn't try the shrimp fried rice, everything else was EXCELLENT. The chicken and broccoli was by far the best - great quality chicken and super fresh broccoli. The special beef was crispy, fried, sweet beef and really good. While the pork fried rice was "lighter," I really liked it - it was nice to have something to balance out the strong flavors of everything else. Moo shu pork was also great although I wasn't crazy about the pancakes. They were a little thinner than I'm used to and the consistency was...off. All in all, for 6 soups and 6 entrees, it came to about $75 with tip which really isn't too bad.Not the nicest restaurant on the inside but a good choice if you're in the International District. (Only in Seattle would we be so PC that we can't call it Chinatown...ridiculous.) Jade Garden is one if not the best Dim Sum in the international district. They have all the regular dim sum treats, like shu mai, shrimp balls, hum bow, etc. The only one issue I have with this place is that they get very confused if you don't want to have dim sum and just want the regular menu. I have a co-worker that is kind of picky and tried to order some sweet and sour chicken off the menu and it was a huge debacle. It is definitely a good place to go for good quality not too greasy and reasonably priced dim sum favorites though. I'll be back! This is one of my favorite spots for dim sum in Seattle. It's well worth the wait outside the door and the hustlin' and bustlin' of short, loud Asian people herded together. The food is pretty fresh, steaming hot, and delish! I enjoy coming here with friends, family, and entertaining my business guests.This is also one of the best places to go for beef chow fun. Whenever you need to get a fix for delicious, authentic, yet greasy Chinese food...this is the best place to come! Especially late at night. There have been many occasions where my husband and I come back from an opera or show in downtown Seattle. Everywhere else is crowded and overpriced. This place is open and cheap...and very delicious!If you are here for dim sum, the service is terrible. That's where I would highly recommend getting it to go. It's faster. If it's a sunny Seattle day, order it to go with some hum baos and enjoy the Danny Woo Park not too far from here. Great place to enjoy some dim sum and the view of the local gardens. This is the best dim sum I've enjoyed since moving to the NW from Cali in 2005! &#160;I'm sure Vancouver, BC citizens can relate, but expatriate Angelinos spoiled on Chinatown, Monterey Park, Alhambra and South Pasadena dim sum excellence aplenty are hard to please. &#160;After my wife and I sauntered out of Jade Gardens for a nice walk around downtown Seattle I was PLEASED!Jade Garden is impressive and has all the ingredients for a super satisfying dim sum such as hot and fresh Siu Mai (shrimp-pork dumplings w/roe on top), Har Gau (shrimp dumplings), tasty tea, and my absolute favorite stuffed eggplant. &#160;Better than any dim sum my wife and I have had in Portland and approaching the quality of places like Ton Kiang in SF or NBC Seafood or Ocean's Star in Monterey Park So Cali.Its loud, the service is questionable but its inexpensive, all about the yummy dim sum and I can't find fault with a place that treats allllll of their customers the same way; &#160;even if "way" equals "poorly." &#160;Big ups to this place for keeping it real &amp; keeping the dim sum yummy! &#160;We'll be back the next time we are in Seattle! Dim Sum hot spot in international district. This place is usually packed and difficult to get seated on the weekends, however, I dont recommend dining in because the restaurant is raunchy and you question the cleanliness of everything. Nonetheless, the food is very delicious, and always prepared in a timely fashion if you're ordering to-go. I've found that there's only a few great items on the menu that are a 9 out of 10 on my scale. Those items are: pot stickers, mongolian beef, and shrimp egg rolls. This is one of the best dim sum place in Seattle's C-town. &#160;When coming here, be prepare to wait. &#160;Patient will reward you. We've only had dim sum twice in Seattle, so we weren't 100% of what to expect. Jade Garden was great. The staff was helpful, atmosphere was OK, the food was delicious, the green tea was very good, and the prices were particularly easy on the wallet. She had shrimp with crab, I had a beefy noodle dish, and amazing ginger pork dumplings.Highly recommended. I remember Jade Garden being the talk of the town a few years ago. It seems to have declined in popularity recently. I went back a while ago and not even Chinese New Year could restore its former bustling atmosphere. This place reminds me of many Chinese seafood restaurants, like T &amp; T in Edmonds. The individual dishes are quite good, but there are a lot of restaurants out there that boast similar quality food. Because I don't think I could comment on the general experience well, I'll talk individually about each dish I got. Maybe I'll keep updating this review and eventually have something to say for each of the 100+ items on the menu.House Special Fish Fillet ($10.95) - delicious soft white fish. The name fails to indicate it, but this dish is completely covered in peas! It's kind of surprising to order a bunch of fish and see that a bright green is the dominant color. Also included are carrots, onions, mushrooms, and maybe some other stuff I forgot. Overall a good dish, but owing exclusively to the fish (not really a big fan of vegetables here).Salted and Pepper Pork Chop ($8.95) - if there's anything you must get here, it's this. This pork chop has just the right amount of seasoning and is very soft. It looks like just an unappealing pile of brown meat at first, but it may just be the best pork chop you've ever had, and at such a low price too! Also, unlike restaurants that serve a similar dish, this one doesn't appear to dump a ton of MSG on it.House Special Tofu Hot Pot ($9.95) - sizzling hot dish of tofu, mushrooms, squid. Maybe some other stuff. It's covered pretty heavily in sauce, so the food will probably come out more than a little juicy. A bit on the salty side, but the good part is that it stays warm longer than most of the other dishes.Stir-Fried Pea Vines with Garlic Sauce ($11.95) - also comes with the choice of "supreme broth" in place of the garlic sauce. Whatever that is. I think it's cooked rather well for what it is, but it's pretty much all green, and again, not the biggest fan of vegetables.Fuzhou Soft Tofu ($9.95) - very soft and yummy tofu floating around in heavy sauce. There's also thinly-sliced mushroom and squid in there, plus this green vegetable that I cannot identify. Hmm, I'm sensing a recurring pattern here...Beef Brisket with Radish Hot Pot ($8.95) - another small hot pot, so the contents come out sizzling and stay warm for a while. The broth in this one is thick and has a vague taste of alcohol. I like the beef, but the radish is pretty terrible and is easily the worst thing they have here. I'm a huge dim sum fan and I've tried all the different places in Chinatown...I still think Jade Garden does the best dim sum. &#160;While it's the best in Seattle Chinatown, it ain't Vancouver good. &#160;Vancouver peeps...don't come here expecting what you get back in Van. &#160;It's a cart Dim Sum place so sometimes the quality can be hit or miss. &#160;If you get them when they are fresh, then it's really good. &#160;But on a few occasions, I've got room temp dim sum if it's been on the cart for a while.It can get super crowded on the weekends and the staff can be ruthless, but having been eating dim sum all my life, it's the norm for these kind of places. &#160;I've come here for dinner too and the honey walnut shrimp and honey BBQ shortribs are fantastic. For years this has been a must stop in Seattle! &#160;Whether it's 1am and you're starving or if you are willing to fight the crowds for dim sum on a Sunday morning, Jade Garden is fantastic pretty much anytime. &#160;From the moment you walk in you can't help but notice the huge fish-tanks filled with fresh seafood. &#160;Huge lobsters, geoduck, and massive crabs, &#160;you know you're guaranteed to get some pretty fresh seafood. &#160;The decor isn't particularly noteworthy, it's basically &#160;your standard Chinatown restaurant, with a couple of hanging red lanterns and some festive art on the otherwise plain walls. &#160; &#160; If you're going to try the dim sum here I'd recommend calling an hour or so before you arrive to secure a spot, otherwise you might be waiting quite a while. &#160;Don't worry if you've missed your spot when you do arrive, they'll go backwards on the list ;) &#160;Being stuffed into the lobby when it's cold and a bit chaotic can be frustrating! &#160;When you are seated, the servers will come around with their carts offering a tantalizing array of beautifully wrapped buns and dumplings. &#160;Pretty comparable in selection to dim sum places in other cities. &#160;Quality too is average, I wouldn't say they go above and beyond, but I've definitely had far worse. &#160;The steamed shrimp and scallop balls, the classic shumai, the taro balls, the shrimp and crab dumplings, egg tarts, the sticky rice...over the years we've managed to try quite a bit and everything is fresh, delicious and visually stunning. &#160;Turnip cakes too are enjoyable, but definitely a bit on the soggy and greasy side at Jade Garden. &#160;I've also found better pork buns elsewhere. &#160;My friend swears by their chicken feet although I admit I'm too much of a scaredy cat to give them a try. &#160;Prices are very reasonable (usually about $10 per person), and as per the usual style you just point or ask for what you want and they just mark it off on a card so you can pay at the end.  &#160; &#160; As for the non-dim sum meals, the beef chow fun and honey glazed walnut shrimp are some of our favorites. &#160;I recommend getting the chow fun dry style (which is still packed with flavor), so that it isn't doused in rivers of unnecessary gravy. &#160;Also recently tried the salt and pepper calamari, and thought they were an excellent starter made even better with their addition of lots of minced garlic (not the best date choice though).  &#160; &#160; &#160;Tea flows freely and is piping hot, but be warned it is authentic and not filtered so you may have little leaves floating in your cup. &#160;Furthermore, you'll want to expect that water must be requested, and it can take a while to get refills when they're busy. &#160;The service might not be the best you've ever had and if you come in for dim sum there is the possibility of an annoyingly long wait. &#160;Potential pitfalls aside, it's a great place for lunch and dinner, and to take to go! My go to place for dim sum. I recommend going there during weekdays. If you only have time to go there on weekends, go early. The line gets absurdly long at 11. Making a reservation does not really help either. They do not reserve a table for you. Instead, they will give you the next available table after you check in with them. Also, they will not seat you unless everyone show up for the table (or almost all). This is the only thing that I do not like about this place.Once you get seated, the food makes you forget about all that wait. Here are some of the must try items: shrimp noodles, sticky rice, fried taro, spare ribs, shumai, steamed buns, egg tarts, and fried calamari. There are a lot more, but I can't list them all. Everything's good!Tips: avoid sitting upstairs, if possible. You have more access to food downstairs. Oh and, don't be mad if you ask for iced water and do not get it. They forget all the time because they are super busy. You need to ask them, like, a few times. I come here pretty much once a week. Yea, it's that good. The dim sum is probably the best in the ID, and it doesn't hurt that their prices are the best either. All the food is very fresh, but you have to make sure you get there early!Some of my favorites: shumai, taro cakes, taro dumplings, chicken feet, pork buns, beef tendon, tripe, tofu skin rolls, prawn dumplings. Basically, everything.And the prices are stellar. $20 for 3 people to eat their fill for brunch, how do you even beat that? Best dim sum restaurant in Seattle! I also get to exercise my Cantonese skills here, and my friends say that they get faster service with me. :)Anyway, I've tried other dim sum places, and unfortunately for Seattle, Jade Garden is the best. When my parents were in Seattle, they asked around and everyone said Jade Garden, which they were disappointed since they wanted to try other places but all of the locals in the area said that this was the place. Jade Garden gets extremely busy during lunch hour even during the week, and especially on weekends, so be prepared to wait! There is an upstairs area for more seating.The best dim sum is in Richmond, British Columbia! Ask me where! :) I have a list! If you have patience, then come here. We waited for about 20 min and generally this is the wait time from the time frame of 1030-1230 or so. There is quite a large variety of dim sum compared to other places. And also compared to other restaurants, they are fairly priced. My family have 4 people in it and generally spend about 80 buckaroos at other dim sum restaurants. We came here with an extra person making it 5 people, and left spending about 55. That's quite a bit of savings! The food is good, the price is good. Can't beat it.Ask how long's the wait, 20 min plus? Take a walk down the street and get some bubble tea and you'll be back in time! Finally tried Jade Garden for dim sum. Clearly its reputation as the best dim sum restaurant in Seattle precedes it because the restaurant was packed and with a number of groups waiting to be seated.Rather than wait for a table, which would have been a modest 10 minutes supposedly, my parents and I decided to sit at a large table that was shared by three other groups. If you are dining alone, this is probably the setup you will have to deal with unless you are getting a takeout order.I found the dim sum menu to have a fair selection, but not extensive or having stuff that I could not find elsewhere. We ordered 7 items which totaled a little over $22. Har gau (shrimp dumplings), chiu chow dumplings (meat mixture), beef tripe, baked BBQ pork buns, bean curd bundle with tofu and enoki mushrooms, fried shrimp &amp; chives dumplings and bean curd rolls.Nothing was bad, but there were quite a few that were just okay. The BBQ pork buns was fine, but the filling was kind of ho hum. The shrimp dumplings had tasty shrimp, but the wrappers were broken. I like that they give you four pieces here. Do note this is a large item menu here, when most places probably have it as a medium. The meat filling mixture in the chiu chow dumplings were not as finely chopped as I would like.The beef tripe was good with a little spice. The bean curd dishes were pretty good. Particularly the rolls. The standout for me though was the fried shrimp &amp; chives dumplings. The fact that it was hot is one the key reasons why.I think Jade Garden is no doubt one of the better dim sum places in town, but not the best. Harbor City at the moment holds that title for me. I'm from the bay area and pretty particular when it comes to Dim Sum. I just moved to Seattle and have tried this place and Harbor City and to be honest, I prefer Jade Garden slightly. The restaurant itself is bigger so the wait time is less chaotic. I actually preferred their Shu Mai, as well as their BBQ Pork Buns. The BBQ Pork Rice Rolls were better over at Harbor City though. I will say that the Glutinous Rice was AMAZING. Like best ever. For that alone I may choose to go with Jade Garden over HC in the future. The host girl showing us to the table was a bit of a bitch, but I expect a bit of bitchiness with all chinese establishments. I went at one on a Saturday, agreed to share a table, and was seated in less than 5 minutes. All in all a good experience and nice to know I can find above average dim sum in the city. Their food seem to be a hit or miss nowadays.I came here for dim sum a few weeks ago. Not only was our food was cold but I saw a couple of roaches crawling around the walls. I recently came here for dinner with an uncle from out of town the food was pretty bland.I'd rather take my business across the street for dim sum. This place is classic, I love coming here for Dim Sum w/ friends on a Sunday or wonton soup and eggrolls for a light dinner. It's typically very busy on the weekends. Love the atmosphere, it's exactly the type of authentic HK experience I crave.Bonus, it's open super late (3am!) This place was super busy at 8pm on a Saturday night! It was very loud, as a matter of fact, the servers and wait staff we're yelling throughout the restaurant. Odd.The food was hit and miss.We ordered Chow Fun and got Chow Mein instead. It was not the best. The General Tao's...eh. The best dish we had were the salt and pepper friend squid, which is not a dish that we would usually choose, but we were feeling frisky. It was light and flavorful.That night however, I awoke from a peaceful Saturday sleep with such awful indigestion! I think I'll stick with the Ho Ho... So it's been a while since I've been to Jade Garden. More like 3 years. Long enough that I didn't know they had posted my Yelp review from my old Yelp account. My mother visiting from NY wanted Dim Sum and so we end up here around 1pm on a Wednesday. It was a 5-10 minute wait. I only found this out after asking the frigid hostess who seemed to confuse her job as hostess with being a Nordstrom salesperson. I ignore this and will usually NOT wait for any sort of meal if I can help it. We get seated only after agreeing to share a table. After picking the usual shrimp in rice noodle, shrimp dumplings and what I thought was a black bean sesame ball (it wasn'), my son points out that he thinks he sees a coackroach on the wall. Now I am a New Yorker but living in pristine Seattle, I have lost my ability to handle the household pests we are accustomed to living with back East. It's a well known fact that the dirtier the restaurant the yummier the food. However to actually witness a roach make it's way up and down a wall, made me loose my appetite. This will sadly be my last visit to Jade Garden. One of the many reasons why I love the city - late night dining! This place is open til 2:30am every night of the week. Awesome! I've only gone in to order take out, but the wait for the food was decent and not oo crazy long like it can be sometimes at restaurants of this sort. The generals chicken, steamed veggies &amp; sezchaunt beef were all winners - both that night and the next day for lunch. I don't have much to compare it to for now, but you know good Chinese food when you taste it and I will definitely be frequenting this place a lot. This place used to be good...about 10 years ago. It seems like since the secret went out that their food was good...the food has been not so good. The last few times I've been here, the wait was extremely long, they stuck us in the back room (which felt like a fixed up storage room) and the food quality was bad. It seemed like the main dining room was served first, anything they had leftover would then go to the back room and by then it was cold. Nothing really tasted fresh. I think I had one or two items, before I got the check and left to find somewhere else to eat. What happened to their fresh quality food?! I'm really disappointed to have to look for another location to get my dim sum fix in Seattle. There aren't a lot of places for decent dim sum in Seattle, but this is one of them. &#160;It probably helps that my family knows the owner here and even though there is a line out there door, there's a table for us...Some things you must try here are the sesame chive shrimp dumplings, ha-gows, and I really like this dish with chicken, imitation crab, fish belly and mushroom wrapped in napa cabbage. &#160;YUM.I'm going back to Seattle next weekend and can't wait have my dim sum! Ok, so this place is cheap... but I've heard people rave about either Jade Garden or Harbor City and I've gotta say, Harbor City is way better. Among all the inedible dim sum that bad Chinese restaurants serve in Seattle, this one's offerings are relatively OK. &#160;I mean, really, unless I have a huge craving for dim sum I would probably still not go there. &#160;But Seattle is just sad like that when it comes to Chinese food. &#160;Luckily, just drive 3 hours to Richmond Canada and you'll get some of the best Chinese food in North America. It's cheap, its crowded, and the food is constantly coming around. 6 people ate for $50, which is pretty damn good. Lines on the weekend are killer, expect a 20 minute wait at minimum. Probably the best dim-sum joint (quality wise) in Seattle. The wait time is chaotic, just like a good dim-sum place should be, especially on the weekends. So always call ahead or be willing to share a table with other groups. Like many dim-sum places, carts and carts will rush to you as soon as you sit. Staff are usually friendly and if you speak Chinese, it'd be much easier to order and get their attention. There's a reason you need to wait to be seated at Jade Garden during their chaotic dim sum hours. &#160;The restaurant is massive, yet it always manages to become filled, although it can get somewhat claustrophobic at times with the staff and food carts rapidly weaving through tables...That doesn't stop me from coming here every Sunday though! &#160;Make sure you try their radish/turnip cake, shrimp and chive dumplings, shrimp rice noodle rolls, lotus leaf rice (delicious rice wrapped in a lotus leaf &amp; steamed). &#160;Wash everything down with a nice pot of Oolong tea!Also: &#160;their homemade (and super secret) hot sauce given at every table is too good to be true! A pack of us descended on the ID with empty bellies craving yum cha. We waited about a half hour for our table. The place was packed to the rafters with hungry diners and carts circling the restaurant laden with saucers of savoury treats.We ordered several varieties of dumplings, bao, crispy salt and pepper calamari, cheong fan stuffed with mushrooms, steamed crisp greens, honey walnut shrimp, turnip cakes and several shrimp dishes.Every morsel was consumed. Either we were famished or the food was stellar, I cannot rightly recall. I know that afterward all of my friends were impressed with the cost of our meal and we vowed to return to the ID to try out another place for dim sum to see how it stacked up.Tea flowed freely and every item on the carts was fresh. I found the service to be attentive and the dining area clean. Our used plates were taken away speedily and while I had to ask a couple of times for ice water, a server finally brought us a pitcher of water.Parking is limited on the streets but there's a pay lot a couple of blocks away. Don't give yourself a headache and just pay the few dollars. I enjoyed my meal at Jade. I had tons of food and they were able to serve us even though they seem to be having their lunch at the same time. I didn't mind nor did they mind.We got the honey glazed prawns and walnuts (amazing), sweet and sour pork, and crab in a black bean sauce. The food came out fast and they also served us some yummy soup. It was really fresh and also the rice was not old!My favorite was those honey glazed prawns that i can't seem to find anywhere else. They were amazing! Crispy and sweet!Yum! I've been here several times over the years and am surprised I haven't reviewed this restaurant. &#160;Jade Garden is known for their dim sum and is known for their hour long waits. The dim sum is alright here. There are certain things that i would recommend getting (lunch and dinner):Chicken FeetEgg TartsBeef chow funShrimp dumplingI would not recommend getting:eggplantthe taro dish with the flaky skincongeeshark fin soupIn general, this is the best that you're going to get for dim sum in the area. I feel like Harbor City across the street is a good competitor (I tend to eat there nowadays)I would not recommend this place for dinner but eh... if i'm craving dim sum and its not crowded, I'd go to Jade Garden. When you want to feast on a whole bunch of little different dishes, dim sum at Jade Garden is the way to go. While the decor can be very tacky with the typical Chinese tableclothed tables and plain walls, this is not one you come for the ambiance, but for food.Service is quick, as they bring out the push carts fairly frequent, just be sure to get here early on a weekend so you get to eat at your leisure without all the hustle and bustle. Otherwise it can get crowded during the lunch hours. Not all the staff speak good English, but the good thing about dim sum is that you can just point to the dishes that you want, and they will serve and mark your card. Jade Garden serves all your typical dim sum dishes: shrimp dumplings, siu mai, cheong fan (rice noodle rolls), buns, turnip cake, lo mai gai (sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf), xiao long bao (little dragon buns or soup dumplings), chicken feet, egg tarts, congee, and more. You can also order bigger dishes from the menu such as noodles and meat dishes if the little dim sum dishes don't seem to do it for you. All dishes are decent and will please many dim sum cravings, though I definitely found it a step lower than even the worst dim sum places in Flushing/Chinatown/Elmhurst of New York City. But what may be lacking in quality, definitely makes up in the extremely cheap prices. We must've ordered 10-15 dishes and the bill only came out to $37.00 which would normally come out to $50-$60 in New York. A-okay. A 4 for dim sum as it's usually fresh since it gets packed all the time. A 2 for normal evening chinese food as it's not really anything spectacular and the oil they used for the fried stuff seemed a bit old. Dimsum is usually a hit or miss. Sometimes the cooking is real fresh, other times it's just reheated over and over until it can't be eaten anymore. I'm generally not a dimsum fan, but honey walnut prawns always impress me. Because it's not Asian, it's Americanized "chinese food". It's still good with enough mayo for several burgers. Outer crunchy crunch, the mayo really smacks you.The hagau, siumay, are just not so good, the prawn inside is just blah, the skin is not as smooth and breaking. The cart lady also sometimes hangs around only one area, and rarely moves. It's hard to reach you if you are so occupied with someone you know and you keep talking to them in Cantonese. Typical dimsum. They only serve some of the more popular items, if you want something they don't have, you have to wait for them to cook it again in the kitchen. What's good is they have dimsum until around 3pm, and the prices are so cheap, as expected from Chinatown.The lines are horrendous though, they always have a waiting list (if you're lucky, it would only be for around 10 minutes, it may go up to half an hour). Maybe they're purposely doing this to us to test our hunger and dedication for dimsum. Trust me, I could just walk out the door anytime.The only good thing I actually like from here is the custard filled sweet buns, oh, when you bite into them, the custard/yellow egg melts out, so be careful not to have it spurt all over your pretty white dress. Eat the whole thing at once if you're a brave soldier, have a few battle scars right (burnt tongue), or have small bites but don't press on the bun or the juice will shoot out everywhere. Beware! If it was up to my choice, I would only go there to order that but I don't want to go through that long line just for that. So I won't go here unless I was forced to. I was one of a party of 13 people that included several school age children. Service was fast, and nearly every dish was very enjoyable. We ate a hearty lunch for $67, not including the tip. It is obviously a local favorite, as it was totally packed, with people waiting outside for tables. I would definitely suggest making reservations if you have a large group. For children who are picky, I would say that the food is not spicy, but still good. Chopsticks were provided initially, but forks were provided by staff for those who were struggling.The tea was amazing. Many of our group seemed to enjoy the shrimp dishes the most. I have to admit to not being happy with Jade Garden in the past, but I think &#160;I may have found the secret, get there early.I hit them up at 10 - 10:30a (they open at 9a) last Sunday and my party of two was seated within 5 minutes and fresh food from the kitchen started rolling by in just a couple of minutes. First time I had the dungeness crab and shrimp steamed dumplings which were real big and tasty. Also had other steamed items, pork spare ribs, and sticky rice. All were pretty good. Not the variety of food items that I am used to from other big cities, but definitely one of the best dim sums I have had in the Seattle area. Favorite Dim Sum in the city, for sure! Almost always crowded, so bring a good attitude and willingness to wait. Selection is very large, quality is great, and prices are reasonable.Only been here for dinner once, and it was pretty good, but not as amazing/mind-blowing as the Dim Sum options. Really, this is probably 4.5 stars for me, but I averaged it down this time. Yum! Drools! WARNING: DONT COME ON A WEEKEND OR HOLIDAY! the wait is horrible!Moving onto the food critic.. Their stuff is amazing. Everything comes out hot and if you request something special theyll make it. There is definitely no complaints regarding food and service .. Id say the sucky part is going on a weekend around 11 (they start dim sum as early as 9 , so 10 would be the best time on weekends). Its jammed pack, waiting is a bitch because I hate waiting. On top of that I hate having to share a table with people I dont know. Its happened a couple of times when its so busy theyll ask if they could squeeze a couple to your larger table.. Im just not fond of having to watch someone elses eating habit when I don't know them. Maybe thats why people say it's not polite to stare when people are eating? Oh well.Parking sucks too! It's been a while since I've been here (maybe 3 years??) but it is the same as I remember - no, not the fanciest or nicest place ever, but the people who work there have always been nice to me, even though it's always super busy.To me, busy in a place like this is GREAT - it must mean the food and service is good, right? And YES, they are. I've never had to wait, although sometimes you share a table. In here, so what? The tables are big and round, and usually you get a whole side to yourself with space in between you and others. The food is always hot and fresh - busy = high rate of turnover! - and I've never had anything that was greasy (or any greasier than it should have been, seeing as how fried food is typically cooked in...oh, never mind) and it is CHEAP.My friend and I ate our fill of hum bao, shu mai, gyoza, crab and shrimp dumplings and I don't even remember what else for less than $20. Oh, and if shrimp dumplings aren't supposed to taste that way, I don't think I want them to be however they are "supposed" to be, because these were pretty damn good.Didn't see any roaches, although I did find a hair in my food. A dog hair. MY dog's hair. Yeah, I know what my dog's hair looks like, because I am always finding it in my food. SIGH. Otherwise, it was all just good, hot, fresh, delicious, cheap food.Even though this place is kind of all the way across town from me, I found myself realizing the other day that I really SHOULD go more often - even with cost of the gas to drive and to park for an hour or two, it is still totally worth it. This place is always so packed for dim sum. &#160;Depending on the size of your party will depend on how quick you'll get a table. &#160;I think the dim sum is fairly good but I'm not sure the wait is worth it. &#160;Don't expect top notch cleanliness. &#160;After all it is the I disrict and you are eating in a Chinese restaurant. &#160;The dirtier it is the tastier the food -- I guess. im a big fan of their DIMSUM. It's so delicious, The reason i rate it 4* because its too crowed and noisy during lunch time and having quite a wait Very pleasant Chinese restaurant. Odd but enjoyable decor - yes, those are plastic fruit and vines hanging from the ceiling. Delicious 5-star fried pot stickers. Satisfying #49 (beef with ginger and onion). Plentiful white rice and tasty tea. Pretty empty late Thursday afternoon, but it wasn't exactly meal time, so altho our service was fast dunno what it's normally like. I could not understand our heavily accented server but he obviously understood us - fast accurate service! Would certainly return. One of the best dim sum in the area. &#160;Lots of choices, great flavors, inexpensive... Parking could be an issue. Awesome food. Great dim sum. One of the best dim sum place. Yum. I came here after I went house hunting and was starving. &#160;I was seated right away because I was by myself. &#160;Dim sum definitely isn't something to eat alone.. especially when wanting to try different dishes. &#160;I had the fried taro balls, honey glazed walnut shrimp, sticky rice, sweet rice cake, and shrimp dumplings. &#160;I left with a very full and satisfied stomach, and a couple take out boxes filled with leftovers. &#160;The workers were very attentive and always made sure to ask if I needed anything each time they passed me. Very surprised that we didnt have to wait that long for a table on the weekend. &#160;For a place that has dim sum on carts, food was always pleasantly hot.Definitely a place where you can't be afraid to straight up ask/battle for your food. &#160;Dim sum was really good, but I wasn't too happy that half of our chicken feet were too hard. Pretty good dim sum, service is alright, speed is decent, but the line is ridiculous! &#160;Go early for lunch if you want to get a seat right away! &#160;The place is a bit run down, but i guess that's a bit on the normal side for Chinatown. &#160;I'm sure I'll be back again. One of the better places for Chinese food in the Seattle area. I've been informed it's one of the better dim sum locales in the area, if not the best. Of course, I can't really help you there. The food overall is good, well-made, and reasonably priced. It's not exceptional, but it's a good place to go if you are craving good Chinese food. My fave dim sum in seattle. Wait is super long, but worth it if you've got some time. Today, the ha-gow was especially yummy, as was the sticky rice and radish cake. The donut wrapped in noodle wasn't super stellar, but I think it's because they forgot to put the soy sauce on it, which we didn't realize until it was all gone. Oh well. I also feel like the prices went down, but maybe we just didn't eat as much as usual? Anyway, i love this place! Been here few times. Food is always mouth watering and satisfying but the service not that good but still a good place. Salt and pepper pork chops are my favorite. I hate waiting so I always go at 2:00pm. haha, the food is not cold and tea is hot. Same quality of food just like those people who waited hrs in the morning. do you know why this place is so popular? &#160;because it serves the best dimsum in town. if you can't be satisfied with this place, then... nowhere else to go! This is my favorite restaurant is Seattle, and one that I go to every month or so. It's consistently good, but I've found that it's better at rush hour than at slower times - I guess the food is fresher then. Also better than any place I've been to in Vancouver. I've eaten pretty much every thing they have by now, and no item has ever disappointed me.The only con is that if you go for lunch, the wait can be over an hour, and the lobby is so small and crammed with hungry patrons that I usually just end up going outside to wait. The four stars is strictly for the food. &#160;The service and ambiance get one star. &#160;If you couldnt tell already...only go here for the food, I would suggest take out. &#160;Went here on a Thursdayn night and there was on other table sitting near us. &#160;The food came out quick and was some of th best chines I have ever tasted, I had a hard time stopping myself from eating. &#160;The portions are huge and deffinately shareablle/take home able. &#160;I ordered the Kung Pow chicken extra spicy, I dont think I got the extra spicy but it was still tasty. &#160;The sauce was nice and thick, the chicken was all whit meat, and the veggies tasted fresh. &#160;My friend ordered th lemon chicken which i had a chance to nibble on. &#160;The outer coating is super crispy and the lemon sauce was just the perfect amount of lemon flavor, and super sweet. &#160;We also shared some of the gyoza, it could have been crispier but the filling was really sastisfying. &#160;The rice was terribly sad for a chineses restaurant...it was still a little crunchy and tatsed like it had been made hours ago. &#160; As for the service...the server was walking away from us taking our order, and we hadnt finished yet. &#160;The drinks were never refilled, and the server sat down at a table about a hundred feet from us, fiddling with his phone. &#160;We finished our meal and were obviously done, as we had not touched our food in the last twenty minutes or so, we actually had to stand up and put our jackets on to get him to come over, box the food, and get our check. &#160;As for the ambiance...the little knat flying around my food for most of the meal was highly annoying.....will be taking out from now on. First, I gotta apologize that this review is two years old. It was just sitting in my drafts.So we had just come from Vancouver with a pretty bad dim sum experience and we were hoping Seattle would provide some much needed solace. Returning to Seattle after twenty-some odd years, I was hoping to find some flavors from my childhood but unfortunately the place I went to as a kid had shut down. Luckily, Jade Garden provided a great alternative. We entered during the lunch hour and were seated communally as we were hungry and didn't mind sharing a table with strangers if it meant we'd eat sooner. Better than an hour wait, right? We ordered some of the basics: char siu bao, har gao, siu mai, egg custard tarts and fried sesame balls filled with lotus seed paste. All the items were well done, tasty and helped to stamp out the Vancouver horror show experience. One of the best places for dim sum that you'll find in Seattle. &#160;It's the only dim sum restaurant that I'll take my family from California or Canton. &#160;What's important to me is that you can taste that they make their own dim sum (some places order it from elsewhere) and it isn't greasy (which dim sum often can be). &#160;I'm not going to compare it to any place in San Francisco or Hong Kong, but, for Seattle, it really is one of the best. &#160;Dim sum should taste fresh, delicate, flavorful, and not greasy, and Jade Garden fulfilled those critera for me.Given that, anticipate a wait. &#160;If you want to get seated immediately, you really do want to get there by 11 on weekdays and by 10 or 10:30 on weekends. &#160;Also, you go there for the food, not the attentive service or ambiance. &#160;This place is much better than Honeycourt a block away, which I was coerced into going to by a friend's friend who claimed it was the best dim sum in town (we've since learned to ignore all food advice that person gives). &#160;Jade Garden is also fresher and less greasy than Purple Dot's dim sum option (I suspect they order in some of their dim sum).Aside from the dim sum, they serve typical Cantonese faire. &#160;When I go for dinner, I get the crispy fried noodles, salted fish and chicken fried rice, 1000 year egg and pork rice porridge -- and they've all been good. &#160;I do have to make a special shout out for the crispy fried intestines with sweet and sour sauce, though. &#160;It's divine. &#160;Those of you who've had it know that it can't be overcooked (which renders out too much fat, and gives it a horrible, too-soft, greasy mouthfeel) and it can't be undercooked, because, well, undercooked fatty offal meat is just gross. &#160;They get it just right here, and it's so delicious. &#160;Prices are also great. &#160;My husband and I gorge comfortably (or uncomfortably, given the massive amount we eat whenever we're here) for $30. 3.5 stars. Not the best dim sum ever, but i have no real complaints except that a few items were a bit bland. The pork ribs were probably my least favorite... not much flavor, but a lot of fat. All the variations of shrimp dumplings were yummy, and I liked the sesame balls. There were a bunch of people waiting for dim sum around noon on Saturday, but the place is much bigger than it looks from the outside. I didn't think the bathrooms were especially gross... maybe they cleaned it up. Hope it stays clean! The best dim sum I have ever had in Seattle area. I took my parents who are visiting from SoCal, and they loved it too. Their chili sauce is GREAT!Their prices are reasonable. They accept credit cards so that's always convenient.Servers and for the lack of better word, cart pushers speak English so communication is not a problem.We were there on a Sunday around 10:45am, so we had to wait for a while to get a table. Be sure to get a ticket number! It was a little noisy, but we didn't mind.Parking are on the streets so we went on a Sunday. This way I don't have to pay for parking.I'll be back for more dim sum; and would be happy to recommend my family and friends. I get excited at the thought of eating here LOL. The egg rolls are crispy and delicious. i typically order the chicken chow mein, special beef, pork rice and beef and broccoli. The texture, taste and quality of these dishes are perfect. Vegetables are not hard and the meat is always tender. Highly recommended :) the hot spot for Chinese people! It's ALWAYS packed in here! Love this place -- it always has the chowfun that i want and I'm never in want of a cart. &#160;But the interior could use a good scrub down, but then again it' is ID. The wait time was long however I fully expected to wait. &#160;Just did not think the food was that good. &#160;There was not variety of different foods. &#160;Same thing on each cart. &#160;Very disappointing. &#160;Will not be back again. I love eating Dim Sum. This is definitely the best place in town. Even though it is always crowded, the wait is worth it. Try it you will like it. This is no doubt the best dim sum place in all of Seattle. &#160;The bathrooms are a little dirty but I over look that. &#160;Highly reccomended. This place is good, big pieces of Dim Sum, but I can't deal with the crowds of people in the lobby. &#160;It gets too crazy, and I just leave everytime. &#160;Tons of places for dim sum in the ID that are less expensive too. The dim sum was great here. &#160;The food comes out quick and comes out super fresh so that was awesome. &#160;The only bad part is that they are so busy, that my recent visit, got a dirty table as well as water on my seat. &#160;Definitely the dim sum spot in Seattle!!! I came here with my family for Dim Sum and it wasn't that great. The place is so small and overcrowded! The service wasn't the best. If you decide to come on a busy day, make sure you have all the tolerance and patience possible. Service is hit or miss here. Sometimes I receive great service, sometimes horrible. I've only been here for dim sum and I think Jade Garden is one of the top places in the Seattle area for it...so far, in my book! It is usually as good as dim sum gets here - plump and juicy chicken feet, smooth rice noodles, flavorful fatty spareribs, etc... I'm not that big of a fan of the uncleanliness here though. The place just looks...... I can't even think of the right word. One of the times I came here for dim sum, I got seated right outside the restroom... I get that it's crowded... but seriously? Do I really need to smell urine and feces while eating my chicken feet? :) Also, another time, we asked for water and the waiter brought water to us alright, WITH HIS FINGERS INSIDE THE CUP!Anyway, despite all the bad, I would recommend this place for dim sum.Just eat with both eyes open :) Yes yes, this place is known for being one of the best dim sum restaurants in Seattle but MAN!!! the wait is sooo long. I made the mistake one morning to not eat breakfast before getting dim sum at Jade Garden. My wait was 45 minutes and I was sooo hungry I was about ready to punch somebody. But when I sat down, the food was great and the bill was SUPER cheap. So is this place worth the wait? Yeah, sometimes. Not all the time. I have dim sum every weekend (I love it that much) and even though I love Jade Garden, I'm not always patient enough to wait so I only come here every once in a while. You can decide for yourself though if the wait is worth it. I use Yank Sing in San Francisco as my benchmark for my favorite Dim Sum: &#160;Excellent quality and setting...although much more expensive than this 'garden' variety dim sum in Seattle. &#160;At Jade Garden, they do have the dungeness crab or maybe a lobster filled dumpling, a tasty treat. &#160;Jade Garden is simply good Dim Sum. &#160;This place is very busy on the weekends. &#160;The service is very friendly. &#160;Get some sweet pork hum bao to go, they warm up nice for an afternoon snack. &#160;You will leave Jade Garden full and happy, although you might have a bruised toe from the crowded waiting area. Roaches or not, this place is great. &#160;After reading the stellar reviews, finally had Dim Sun last week. &#160;The food was outstanding! &#160;Baked Hum Bao were perfect with a great blend of Pork and Bun while the Honey Walnut Chicken was quite tasty. &#160;We saw a roach crawling on the back wall which we took care of ourselves. Hopefully the Seattle health inspectors are making their round and the restaurant is on top of this. It may be the best dim sum in the Seattle area.Dim Sum is great. I've been to Hong Kong and, while it's obviously not quite as good, it is pretty good.That said, try to get there early, as a crowd always forms.Also, I wouldn't recomment it for anything other than dim sum. I went there for dinner once and it was meh. This place is packed on the weekends for Dim Sum (good sign of good food) and the price is very good for groups. &#160;I go here maybe once a month so just dress warmly if you're standing outside because it's worth it once you get in. Solid dim sum, not amazing, but typically producing a steady and reliable quality of food. i can't believe i never wrote a review for this place! i haven't been here in AGES for dinner so this review is strictly for dim sum (different chefs). i hadn't come here for dim sum in a while too actually. not because i don't like the place, it's just that it's ALWAYS jam packed! most dim sum spots have a prime time of about 11 - 1 ish. this place is jumping from 10 to 2:30 or 3! yikes. so it's crazy that i thought we could snag a seat for the five of us this past monday on prez weekend! but i'm actually not crazy cause i was rollin' with my folks and my folks are old school chinatown :) i dropped them off while i went to park the car so they could wait in line. i guess that was not necessary because by the time i got back to the restaurant from parking we had a seat already! how can that be? the line was out the freakin' door. shoot, you don't know my moms. the hostess saw her rollin' in and was all like "oh! mrs ma, you're here for dim sum? how many? ok, right this way" she didn't write no names in the book or nothing. she just had somebody clear off a big table for us and viola! hahaha. i love eating with my folks!!!! ok, so on to the food. we started with the staples: har gao, shiu mai, chicken feets, shrimp rice noodle wrap, scallop dumplings, tripe (book), stuffed green peppers x2, sticky rice wrapped in leave, tripe (honey comb), tofu skin wrapped pork, fried tofu skin wrapped pork/shrimp, and other stuff i'm forgetting. everything was fresh and very hot. i can see why with this kind of turn around it's not hard to keep things moving and that's the key to successful dim sum. you can't have stuff steaming in the carts indefinitely. the only misses in my opinion were the honey comb tripe. flavor and texture were not there. not nasty but compared to everything else it wasn't as good. what was a surprise to me was the level of service. sure, it's not like in richmond, bc where you have an individual captain but the push cart ladies and really all the staff were smiling and friendly, never surly - i know! crazy! still hands down the best dim sum in seattle in my opinion. buddha and i love this place for dim sum! we always get great service and awesome food =) stuffed eggplant, tripes, shrimp stuff, spare ribs, chicken feet...yummmmm! I'm only reviewing Dim Sum - went on a weekday early. &#160;The place smelled authentic, took me back to a trip I made to Hong Kong years ago. &#160;The food was very, very good. &#160;I think since the place wasn't busy yet, the variety of options was a little limited, but the service was good. &#160;I'd say 4+ stars. &#160;Truly a Seattle treasure. Best dim sum in town. Came here for the first time yesterday to eat dim sum. It was delicious!! Ordered chives and shrimp dim sum special and it was so yuuuumy!! Not only that the shrimp ball was really good!! I didn't need to wait in line when I came around 3pm.. Usually when I'm in international district there's so many people waiting in line so I never ended up going in but now I can see why people wait in line on weekends! Can't wait to go back again!! the food is awsome!
Started coming here with friends on a regular basis and have yet to be disappointed.We always go on Saturdays so that is the only day I have reference for. But if you show up at 9 there is no wait. If you are going to show up at 10 or after it is probably worth calling in a reservation because that is when things start to get crowded.You can get all your usual dim sum favorites along with the walnut shrimp (usually on the cart with the deserts) which we have started to get more and more of. Try the broccoli if you never have, it isn't the best thing in the world but it is worth a shot.Pretty typical to get out for about $10 a person and you get stuffed. Highly recommended. I've been here four times. &#160;Twice on my own during the week with friends from out of town and then I've met friends who live in Seattle but are from Hong Kong originally (or at least half the couple is) here on the weekends.During the week, there has been a minimal wait time, but I have ended up sharing a table with other folks. &#160;We struggled to ever get tea poured one of the times...I probably wasn't aggressive enough about flagging someone down. &#160;When I've been "on my own" - I've still had excellent dim sum at a very reasonable price.With my friends who come here all the time and have one of them from Hong Kong - it's a totally different experience. &#160;I've had some amazing varieties of dim sum with them...just some really neat stuff and it's all tasted amazing. &#160; The wife (who is the Hong Kong half) knows how to get stuff here and didn't hesitate to go to the back and get a container for our leftovers! :-) &#160;Great place - yeah, there's a wait. &#160;But it's worth it for excellent, authentic dim sum. Scary. The amount of mystery meat my friends were served was disheartening. Some description on the menu or maybe a waiter who can explain what the hell we were eating would have been nice. The wonton soup had a tasty broth and yummy bok choy, but the wontons were tough and stuffed with some strange brainy looking meat. We asked the waiter what it was... still waiting on that answer.The stuffed bean curd also had a mystery stuffing that we also couldn't figure out but was like gristle stuffing. Not tasty.The veggie fried rice has a good amount of veggies to it and a nice variety, but was completely and utterly flavorless. We had to drench it in soy sauce and chili oil to make it taste like anything.The General Tso's Chicken was awesome, the garlic bok choy was impressive (if a little undersalted), and the honey walnut prawns were good... but none were particularly amazing... I say they were awesome and impressive compared to the other crap food we got. In general... I would check out some of the other awesome Chinese food in the ID and avoid the Jade Garden. I am originally from Montana...I know nothing about dim sum...all I know is that this place was great. &#160;This was my first true experience with dim sum and it was not as intimidating as I thought it would be. &#160;The ladies with the carts were patient and just let me point to random things that looked tasty. Everything was very good, except for a fried ball of beans that my companion ordered...not really my thing. &#160;I recommend the walnut prawns and any of the prawn dumplings. &#160;The fried sesame seed covered balls (excuse my ignorance on the actual names of these items) are good for dessert.It is always busy...but worth the wait! Probably mentioned in other reviews, but there is always a long waiting period here unless you happen to sneak in a reservation beforehand. Perhaps it is just a coincidence, but it seems that every time we have gone to Jade Garden we have run into someone we know especially during lunch time. Hands down, this is the place to go for dim sum in Seattle and the dumplings are quite large for the price. Going to school in Oregon, the return home always calls for a trip to Jade Garden at one point or another for dim sum. Dare to say it? The restaurant may in fact have the best dim sum in all of Washington if not the entire northwest. Dim sum and Vietnamese beef noodle soup are probably the two things that I look forward to the most as far as food when thinking about home in Seattle because Oregon never seems to get either of those experiences right. This Dim Sum place is decent for its price range. &#160;The restaurant serves dim sum daily until 3pm (for those of you who are curious and don't want to make a call to find out). &#160;My friends and I arrived at 2:55pm on a Monday but the restaurant was very accommodating and served us anyway.The dim sum quality here is respectable. &#160;You can get most of the traditional items here like shao mai, BBQ pork bums, and chicken feet. &#160;What separates this place from the fancy dim sum restaurants in BC is probably a bit of novelty and the overall ambiance. This place was bananas busy for Friday dim sum but the host desk area was organized chaos. I don't go to a Chinese restaurant for smiles and soft voices. The food was really good and the carts were stocked with my favorites and standards. The chili sauce is on the table so you don't have to ask for more and the tea selection and quality was great. I will definitely be returning here. Things that this place has an abundant of: 1. A LONG ASS line. Literally sprawling out of their door during peak times like lunch and dinner. 2. Loaded MSG. Paranoid health freaks may want to proceed with caution.3. Women with carts. I felt they were pretty good stocking up every once in a while to keep up with the demand. The food, though, was worth the wait and MSG. It is a plus if you go in and speak Chinese, as well. They tend to service you a bit better that way, I have noticed. O Jade Garden, how I wonder what you really have to offer?Rolled in for dinner one night, and ordered a slew of food for 2 peeps. Beef Steak in XO sauce, Honey Walnut Prawns, and Pork fried rice. All of it was served piping HOT, which I think is a huge deal. But they all came out at slightly different times. Pretty sure the fried rice came out about 10min after the other 2 entree's. All I know is, I prefer to eat my rice with my entree not as another course after the main event. But hey, better piping hot and a few minutes later than, cold at the same time.The Beef with XO sauce was hearty and earthy, would def order again. The Honey Walnut Prawns were good, but overly sweet for my tastes. We only ordered them because of all the reviews raving about the dish. Good, but maybe as an after the rice dish ;)Can't wait to come back and get down on their Dim Sum that everyone talks about. Oh, my all time favorite dim sum in Seattle is still Top Gun, but since we already brought out friend from out of town there, we thought we'd broaden his dim sum experience and check out this top rated dim sum spot in Chinatown (yes, it's still Chinatown to me!). It's definitely ghetto Asian with the decor and doesn't look as clean as other places that I've been to but the food was solid and was relatively inexpensive (~$30 for 3 people - and we were stuffed to the brim!). We came at 11am thinking we'd beat the Sunday dim sum rush, but the wait time was ~ 20-25 min and despite how crazy everything looked up by the hostess stand, they were fairly organized and got us seated and eating in no time flat. Dim sum was solid, so no complaints there. The dim sum is good, above average but not worth the 1hr wait.Actually 1hr wait at some good dim sum in LA/San Ganbriel area... but this was not worth it especially when you get skipped the 10th time.The food: standard dim sum fare that are overall better than average. The price is right. We went for the typical ha gow, shu mai, sticky rice, buns, taro rice, custard cake.The place: it's crowded and busy... which is a good sign for most places. &#160;However my problem was while waiting for that hour, a lot of people who clearly just came in, were seated right away because they either knew one of the hostess or one of the servers or someone. This is rather annoying for everyone else waiting for their turn (you go in and put your name on a waiting list and they seat the next group that would fit that table best).In short, what would have been a 20-30 min wait turned out to be 1hr wait. &#160;I'll go to Hong Kong seafood which does not have a wait time and with dim sum "almost" on par with Jade Garden... at least I won't have to wait and wait, and wait, and wait, and get skipped, and wait, and wait... and wait! There was a time where I wanted Dim Sum and I DIDN'T go to Jade Garden. That time was called NEVER.Prepare to come hungry, wait a long time to sit, and then leave stuffed. Fortunately the International District provides ample walking opportunities so you can walk your food off before you go home.*BURP* ....'scuse me... Quick service, wait can be horrendous, awesome food, great price. My friends and i went during lunch time (1230) on a Friday. We got 6 orders of dim sum and it was only 21 dollars. SWEET!:-D My wife and I have been spending weekend mornings exploring the ID Dim Sum fare. &#160;Was put off by lines outside of Jade Garden but Sunday morning at 9:20 we walked right in. &#160;On our first visit things went well. The place was already busy but not packed. &#160;Seated right away and immediately surrounded by carts. &#160;Scallops and shrimp were great but the Pork and ginger was an incredible burst of flavors. &#160;When I'm eating dim sum I want the carts to come by periodically so I can grab some more food. &#160;Our second visit was wretched. &#160;Again early plenty of open tables so fast seating. &#160;Unfortunately we sat close enough to the kitchen that we were horrified. &#160;It was like the opposite of our first visit. &#160;I'm surprised the health department allows it to continue operating.Carts didn't come by and when they did the selection was poor. &#160;We left early and went across the street to finish our meal. I have heard that the chef the made this place rock is now working around the corner.  I would say this place is inconsistent and with so many good dim sum places with walking distance why wait for a table. &#160;That's just me. Definitely my favorite dim sum in Seattle. Hot, fresh and delicious. The wait is long, but it amps up your appetite. The honey walnut prawns are the best thing I've ever put in my mouth... ever. Best dim sum in Seattle!!! It is jam packed every weekend. If you don't want to risk having to wait one hour, then go at 10am or take to-go, which is what my family tends to do most of the time. Most people arriving right around noon time literally stand outside to wait because the waiting area inside is already filled with hungry dim sum beings. Go for the food and NOT for the service. They're typical Asians who just want to get as much money from you as they can serving you GOOD dim sum, they don't care about customer service... so if you mind how they serve you, then I'm sorry... this place may not be for you. So why do I think their dim sum is the best? Mainly because their steamed dumplings are big, juicy, and tasty. Yes, big and juicy... Yum Yum. I really like their spicy sauce that goes with the dim sum as well. Their prices aren't the most expensive, but they also aren't the cheapest... but hey, you get what you pay for! I'd rather pay a little more for better quality and Jade Garden does it! They have chicken feet as well, but unfortunately I don't think their chicken feet is the best because their fingers aren't plumped enough. Haha. It might sound disgusting, but chicken feet in general is quite addicting. I also like their fried shrimp and chives dumpling that I can only find at Jade. Basically, if you're craving for dim sum, you ought to come to Jade Garden! I don't want to name everything they have, I'll have them surprise you!Not only does Jade Garden serve dim sum during lunch, they also a wide variety of food during dinner as well. My family and I always come here if we decide to go out to dinner for Chinese food. Especially if you are planning a large family dinner, come here for their special family dinner packs. Although the restaurant isn't that large, but don't let that stop you from trying out one of the best Chinese restaurants in Seattle. One time we got Mango pudding as our dessert and it was one of the most delicious I've had! I used to love this placeI used to love their honey walnut prawnbut not anymore...they decrease the portion of their prawn, also the taste of the prawn was not as good and fresh as before. It also doesn't have the taste of "honey" anymore..Dissapointed :(But I still love their ca liong (don't know how to write) It's a deepfried chinese donuts covered with rice noodle and you should dip it with a brown sauceI can't stop eating this thing :9Also their pork bun is still goodI used to dislike this kind of bunbut when I tried their pork bun, I lOVE ITthe bun is light sweet and so soft :9and the pork filling was also good and tastyperfect combinationnote: eat it the best when it's still warm :9other dim sums are just so so, I thinkwell, I think I will come back again but I'll consider not to order the prawn.. My favorite place for dim sum! . If you go on the weekend it's usually about a 30 minute wait. If you're small group, like two or three, and don't mind sharing table, the wait won't be as long. I love their taro cakes, they are always hot when I get it. Service isn't great (if you dont speak, or go with someone who speaks Cantonese), but where in ID is right? This place is a good go to place for great chinese food... &#160;Very fast, good quick service and its a lively place. &#160;I am noticing more now that there is a line these days... but surprising this restaurant is larger than it looks, there is more space in back. &#160;We always get the beef chow mein, honey spare ribs and walnut shrimp, all classics and done very well here. &#160;Yum... looking forward for another hit soon. Apparently I've never had really good Chinese food because the first time I ate at Jade Garden I cursed all those lost years of crappy takeout - this is the real deal, man. Lunchtime is dim sum and a long wait. Go here for an early bird dinner and you have the place to yourself and the food comes out pronto. Ahhh...the food. Steaming large portions of the most awesome Chinese food ever. I can't really describe it, it's just plain good. I recommend the egg rolls, special beef, and chow mein. Try to come with lotsa people so you get a big table and with it a lazy susan in the middle, yeah! Share the feast and leave happy. I've always thought that dim sum is the hustle and chaos of free market capitalism acted out in food. Jade Garden has embraced this mentality to the core. Servers wheel the food right up so you and see and smell it. If you hesitate, they grab what you're looking at and wave it under your nose. Everybody is running around, talking quickly and loudly, like a busy diner or an izakaya. It's very forward but never rude, and the results are totally satisfying. The sesame-crusted pork and shrimp dumplings are a tasty surprise. The pork bao is a bullseye. Afterwards I felt like I was hit by a Chinese food truck. Bam! I want to give this place 3.5 stars but there isn't that option. I only come here for dim sum and I think it is good for the Seattle area. &#160;Do the usual: &#160;Har Gow, BBQ pork bun, congee, xiu mai and sticky rice. &#160;A favorite place for me to go when I am in the ID area for dim sum. &#160;My advice is on the weekends when they serve the good stuff, come early about 11 to get quicker seating. &#160;Haven't tried their Chinese food menu so can't comment on that. &#160;This rating applies only to Dim Sum. Great for Dim Sum and menu items! &#160;Not every dish is perfect, but most are very pleasing. &#160;Expect to wait a good half hour or so especially for Dim Sum on busy days. &#160;Ordered to-go one night and the order was prepared quickly and tasted very fresh. &#160;The beef and broccoli dish was our favorite of the foods we ordered! &#160;The Chinese broccoli (gai-lon) was cooked perfectly. &#160;For Dim Sum the shu mai was not my favorite. &#160;I've had better, but the rest of the items were great and the cart servers were very attentive. Their service is decent and the people at the counter are always nice. Dim sum is great. &#160;When you go there during lunch, you'll notice the place is filled with black-haired customers. &#160;For a chinese restaurant, that is always a good sign. &#160;Dim sum is very well priced. &#160;Dim sum for 4 should cost around $35-40, including tax and tip! &#160;Advice: arrive at 11AM or 1PM, but not in-between. &#160;Otherwise, it'll be a wait! &#160;Weekends are busiest. &#160;This place would have received 5 stars but the floors are typical of a Chinatown restaurant. Jade Garden served up some excellent dumplings! Perhaps some of the best shu-mai I've had. Service was fast and friendly. Parking was not bad and there was no wait, even an hour after it opened, on a holiday. Cheap and delicious dim sum. Seattle's best Dim Sum with Seattle's longest wait. First you get to wait to park, then you get to wait for a table but ah, now you get to wait for any kind of attention. But when the cart finally comes by, you know you're in for a treat of the most unique and delectable Dim Sum morsels on the West Coast. Five stars for the food that's best, one star for all the rest. These guys have it nailed!! &#160;Everything is great! &#160;Try the flaky pork roll &amp; walnut shrimp. &#160;Big yummers!! First let me start by saying this is by far the best Chinese food you can get on the West Coast! I ordered the double mushroom beef and the seafood pot. Both dishes were absolutely amazing! The meat and seafood was cooked to perfection and the mushrooms were crazy good! Service is not this best I have ever experienced (at peak times)... But believe me the food is worth it, I will be coming here anytime I really want good authentic Chinese. Yummy....I haven't stopped thinking about this place since we left! Ok, so I waiting for my Husband and wasn't quite sure what to do... A lady came up to me and asked if I wanted custard and spring rolls, I said sure, I thought it was like bread at an Italian restaurant or chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant... My husband got there and said " You ordered already?" haha... Anyway, I am glad I started with those, everything was amazing, fresh, ready, and cheap! It was a perfect lunch date before going back to work. Although it was not busy when we went ( because it was 2:00) There is usually a line around lunch or dinner time. I think it is worth it though... I will def be back, prob this week! Didn't like my dinner at all. Will have to come back on a Saturday morning for dim sum and hopefully update this review to a more positive one. I have to confess that I usually only come here for dim sum on the weekends. &#160;But we had a family dinner Friday night and my MIL wanted to come here for dinner. &#160;When we showed up around 6pm- the restaurant was fairly empty but it filled up rapidly. &#160;When we left- it was full. &#160;We ended up ordering salt baked chicken, lamb hot pot, beef short ribs in honey, sea bass hot pot, tofu dish, stir fry clam dish, sea cucumber and veggies, and pea vines. &#160;With the exception of the lamb pot, everything was really tasty. &#160;I think everyone was really impressed with the chicken. &#160;It was not too salty and really moist. &#160;The kidlet who normally does not eat beef, ate 2 bowls of rice with the short ribs. &#160;The lamb pot was meh- I've had better. &#160;There wasn't alot of filler (waterchestnuts and mushrooms) but the beancurd was overcooked and hard and the lamb was really chewy.. &#160;The service is always good but that could be b/c we're regulars and my in-laws know everyone by name. &#160; I'm sure we'll be back for some more family dinners! Hmmm. &#160;I didn't really love my meal. &#160;We had hot and sour soup, triple mushroom scallops, and beef chow fun. &#160;I thought the hot and sour soup was not quite right. &#160;The chow fun was quite bland. &#160;And the Mushroom and scallop dish was ok. &#160;The service was awesome and super nice!
I went here last night after far too many cocktails. From what i recollect, it was amazing! The beef chow-fun was delicious and far above average, as they used plenty of bean sprouts to not only cut the usually overwhelming beef taste, but it also helped with the incredible amount of grease that this dish is usually known for. We also ordered a great stuffed tofu dish that involved fried prawns and piping hot tofu cubes.As said before the service is a bit lacking, we needed a waiter a few times but it seemed as though they were a bit understaffed. The place is pretty clean, with a crab tank in the front, green color scheme, and extremely clean windows, it was incredibly inviting. i Think the location on the east side of Chinatown helps with giving them a distinct feel, it isn't given the foot traffic opportunities some of the other places have down the hill, and i think this may have something to do with how cool this place is. I'd go again. I'm an avid dim sum lover. Growing up with this stuff was always a treat with my family in the international district (ID). I can't say it's FABULOUS because nothing beats the more authentic Chinese food in China. I would have to say Vancouver, BC and San Francisco are the two places where you find more authentic Chinese food. Go to ID for a quick fix if you can't afford to fly overseas.Jade Garden has one of the most selections in Seattle. There's plenty to try. Go with an open mind! Dim sum... literally means "touch heart". You will find 3 or 4 little dumplings in the little bamboo steam racks that they cart from table to table. The waitress will scoot her cart over and tell you what she has. If you know Chinese they often ask "what do you want" without telling you, but if you're venturing here for the first time... they'll be nice and open the lids to show you what they have. Be open minded and try something at least once before declaring you don't like it. Even if it's as weird as chicken feet... your taste buds might thank you for it later. Do try their deserts. What I like is Hom Soi Gok.. view here (http://www.dimsum.com/ds&#8230;). Price:Each dish is labeled small, medium, large or specialty and the cost starts at $2.50 per plate. The bill at the end usually be about $12-$15 dollars per person (if you eat a lot). Yum Cha- "drink tea". (People sometimes say this in reference of dim sum). If you don't want tea, kindly let them know before they bring you a pot. Each person is usually charged a .50 cent "tea fee". If you're into tea, ask them about their selection that you can choose from. Free refills with tea. Service: As others mentioned.. understaffed. The food is worth it though. If you want someone's attention... make eye contact and flag them over even when they seem busy. You can't sit there all day..As for their dinners... they're pretty good. Though their dimsum wins the popularity contest among the locals. All I have to say is BE ADVENTUROUS!!!!Enjoy! Dim Sum is a beautiful thing. &#160;I love the mode of service; endless carts wheeling up to your table, huge selection of pretty, mysterious food bundles. &#160;Maybe you can tell, but this was my first dim sum experience. &#160;Why have I not visited this world before age 37? I owe this one to my sister dragging me here after picking me up from Sea-Tac. &#160;This place is shrimp and pork lovers heaven. &#160;Everything we picked was fantastic. &#160;We only had one dessert item...these little fried balls of rice dough filled with a bean paste, rolled in sesame seeds, and deep fried. &#160;Oh my god...dreams are made of this food. &#160;It's beautiful, delicious, fun to eat, kid-friendly and really filling...what more can you ask for? &#160;Fine food adventure. &#160;I'll be back! I can't say anything about the entrees here, but the dim sum is amazing. I would recommend going with someone who has previous dim sum experience, or better yet, speaks Chinese, because it can be an overwhelming and intimidating experience. Some items might look or sound strange to you (i.e. chicken feet), but be adventurous because pretty much everything is delicious. Best of all, it's relatively cheap. I usually go in a group of 5 or more, and it ends up costing only $8 or so per person. Make sure you try the sticky rice. And the rice noodle with fried dough in the middle. Great spot for a late night snack. Try the salt and pepper pork chops. Don't expect much from the decor or service. Say hi to the crabs on death row on the way to your table.
Went there after the festivities of Chinese New Year. It was very busy but was well worth the wait. They seated us right by the kitchen so we were able to see all the yummy Dim Sum. Dim Sum is served pretty late here which is very good and so is the price. :D I am now a complete addict that can barely stand a week that goes by without a visit to this fabulous establishment. &#160;Dim Sum Yummmm!!!! &#160;I love it. &#160;My personal favorites all reside on the steam trolley as opposed to the more bready stuff. &#160;Pardon my phonetic spelling on this one: &#160;Shoo Mai... &#160;little pork dumplings with a prawn in the center (sometimes) and a sprinkling of those tiny little bits of fish roe that pop in your mouth.... &#160;a delight. &#160;And the lobster dumpling... &#160;and the short ribs!!! &#160;Heaven... &#160;all of it. &#160;Sigh. Dim sum! How I love you! Be mine toniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight! Jade Garden does good dim sum which is it can get busy on the weekends. &#160;Although the decor is so-so and the service hit-or-miss the food is spot on. &#160;A great variety served fresh. &#160;One thing not on the carts that I really like (I think it's listed on the back of the tally card) is the rice noodle with crispy donut, yum! &#160;While dim sum is a lot of what people go there for, their dinners are great too. &#160;Try the crispy walnut shrimp.
I LOVEEEEE THE YOGURT. &#160;It was the perfect touch at the end of the meal.And the broth for the Pho was really good. The only thing I didn't like was the chicken. For some reason, it tasted a bit different to me.I wish I could have tried that sandwich that everyone's been raving about, maybe next time? Okay I bump on my review to 4 stars only for the SANDWICHES. The sandwiches are cheap, delicious and come slightly toasted. My favorite is the bbq pork. I am still perplexed though on why the lady who runs the cashier never smiles. I even took suggestions from friends that she prefers when people order in Vietnamese. Tried it one day, and nope nothing! Ah well, I will gladly deal with stone-face cashiers if it means a yummy baguette is headed my way. This place is fantastic for a nice, quiet sit-down-lunch. &#160;It is hidden a little bit off the well beaten path of the Ave, but it is a nice, lovely find. The service is quite nice/friendly and to the point. The free dessert-the yogurt- that they give you with a nice sit-down meal is the perfect finishing note to a satisfactory meal. My ALL TIME favorite is their 3$ 8" bbq pork sandwhiches which they also can put a fried egg in. It is by far the best deal that anyone can get on the ave--way better than the subway 5$ foot long deal or any jimmy johns' sandwhich! It is extremely filling as well, Soooo worth it!Their coffee is delicious as well--and their (pardon my american) soups are wonderfully warm, calming, and tastey. Results in a calming lunch/ dinner if need be!So come and enjoy! Def not the best Vietnamese, but you can't beat the bang-for-the-buck factor. &#160;Got the Bun something (vermicelli rice noodles w/ eggrolls) ended with the complimentary homemade yogurt. &#160;Yogurt was interesting cuz it has a little 'tang' to it. &#160;All for about $7.Duly noted under my internal Cheap Eats List.Oh, and Ban Mih (sp?) sandwiches are about $2.50(!) This place is my favorite for Vietnamese! I always come here for the Vietnamese Sandwiches, they're the best on the ave. The staff and service is always great and the shop is small and sweet. I agree that they serve one of the best if not THE best banh mi in Seattle. &#160;I love the tofu sandwich with the fried egg - delicious with a bit of chili sauce on the side (or without)!! &#160;The bread is always crispy and light on the outside, tender on the inside. &#160;Not sure why the primary woman there doesn't smile at everyone -- she sure smiles at me every time! &#160;Nice people, great housemade yogurt, too. Gross. Twice been served cold food including cold, soggy spring rolls. The bottom of my bowl had water in it, I guess from the noodles being cooked and not drained. My food was stone cold aside from the stir fried shrimp that was on top. I am a regular at this place for a late breakfast (the grilled pork sandwich with egg, and an iced coffee with the sweetened condensed milk) or lunch (can be the same, or the rice noodle bowls with pork and veggies are good too). &#160;I usually do takeout, but the yogurt after a sitdown meal is good and a nice touch. &#160;I haven't tried the pho here. &#160;It's cheap, fast, and the woman who runs the place is super friendly. You cant beat what you get for the price. The vermicelli is awesome, the sandwiches are great. &#160;One of my favorite places to go during college, whether by myself for a sandwich (or two) or even to grab lunch with a prof. Its great.
"Can we just write a review that says, 'All those other reviews, they are wrong?'" &#160;That's what my dining companion, who shall remain unnamed, said. &#160;She liked the decor and the vibe (inexplicably), but we could both agree that the food was just plain not good. &#160;Add glacially slow service and a musty, mildewy odor, and you will thank god you rubbed the Buddha's belly for luck when you suddenly notice that there is a totally sweet blues dance class going on in the middle of the restaurant!They start off with a little swaying in place, so you might be hoping that it's going to be a line dancing class. &#160;No, the Buddha didn't give you that much luck, but still, it's not half bad. &#160;Lots of partner-swapping, clumsy-dancing goodness, to distract you from the fact that you still haven't gotten the appetizers you ordered twenty minutes ago.Then they come. &#160;Chicken fritter things. &#160;They taste like microwaved chicken mcnuggets, my friend says. &#160;I'm less convinced, but that turns out to be because hers contains all the chicken; mine only has a couple shreds of well burnt chicken skin or something. &#160;It's basically a fried ball of starchy mush the size of a hamburger. &#160;We eat about 1/4 of it, between us.I'll save you from description of the second appetizer, some kind of taro root chicken finger things, and skip to our entrees, which arrived about two and a half minutes after the appetizers. &#160;They looked like fancy TV dinners. &#160;The shrimp were tiny and cooked to the consistency of rubber bands; the green beans tasted like they might've been frozen, cooked, refrozen and then warmed up in the microwave; the plantains were basically inedible; I actually kind of liked the rice/beans mix, but it was unnecessarily oily; the dressed beets would've been ok if one of them hadn't leapt off the fork and assaulted my shirt. &#160;The only thing that was actually, genuinely good, was the spicy cabbage/carrot slaw. &#160;That I really enjoyed, but it was too spicy for my unnamed friend to eat.If you have to go to Waid's Haitian, the only thing I can tell you is to show up on the second or fourth Tuesday around 8, get a stout cocktail and a big bowl of spicy slaw, and pull up a seat to watch the magic of the blues dance. &#160;Anything else you do at your own peril! Clandestine drinks are the best idea for this tucked away Haitian restaurant. Food is not. Out of the dozen or so things we tried &#160;- including staples like rice &amp; beans and some more adventurous items like a shrimp dish that purported to taste like lobster - I liked exactly zero. &#160;Just trust me when I say that the copy writing is the best part of the menu and you should write off the food entirely. Drinks, on the other hand, seem like a fun gamble. They offer all sorts of imported beers, and fruity cocktails with hilarious names like "Monkey's Breakfast" or "Fruitypantz". If you sit at the bar you will be treated to a friendly chat with the bartender and if you sit in a booth you can just forget that the rest of the world exists...until a dance class takes the floor or raggeathon kicks in...then you have a bit of entertainment. Be sure to enjoy Waid's for the unique establishment that it is and you should have a great time after you've kicked back a few tropical cocktails. Looking for a place that has the vibe and flavor of love? That is the desire of Waid Sainvil, the owner had when he decided to open up his place.You often will not sit alone or if you're coming with a group of friends, be prepared to be introduced to nearly everyone there by Waid himself. From the outdoor seating where all the smokers hang and the 2nd hand smokers come to get their fix, to the upstairs balcony with comfy couches or even the pillow room...the balcony is where people watching can be fun...especially watching the drunk guys looking to dance or attempting to dance which is even funnier.The bartenders are very friendly, pour very generous drinks which I LOVE!Waid's always has a different flavor each night of the week, from spoken word, to salsa, comedy, reggae and more. Can't really get bored if you go 7 nites a week.If you're looking for a different place to hang on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night with a friendly vibe...stop on by and meet Waid and the family. I love Waid's. &#160;Anything with shrimp is to die for and I personally love the plantains and the spicy dipping sauce-soup like item that I think comes with every item (I cannot tell how many ingredients it takes to make it). &#160;I have never had to wait long for dinner, but since it is open all day I think it can take awhile to get food in the afternoon (and it is 'mood-lit' inside so it feels like night). &#160;Meals take a time here because, I feel, it's the laid back Caribbean style, do not try to make a run of it during a short lunch break or you will be disappointed.Waid's atmosphere kicks ass. &#160;Comfy booths, dining around well configured around a dance floor, and a large outdoor covered area with tables and chairs, and pillow room upstairs. &#160;It is impossible to have a bad time and Waid the owner makes everyone feel at home and works to build the 'family' by introducing everyone and you will be told at least once about how the place is built on love. &#160;Occasionally &#160;some characters will get in, but that happens everywhere. &#160;Each night has a theme/event/live music and by midnight almost everyone is dancing, which to me is the best part in a society where people cannot seem to get their butts out of the booths. When we arrived at Waid's at 6PM on a Friday, my partner and I were the only ones there. &#160;This seemed a little odd, given the sheer size of the restaurant. &#160;But our waitress explained to us that the place doesn't really pick up until the later hours, when it also doubles as a dance club. &#160;But since we were the only guests at the time, the hospitality we received was second to none. &#160;For my entree, I had Taso, which is Goat bits marinated with black pepper, cloves, onions, slat garlic and green bell peppers. It was more amazing than I could ever have imagined Goat to be. &#160;What made the dish so exciting though, was the assortment of sides that came with it. &#160;Everything from fried plantains, beet salad, spiced greenbeens, and 1 or 2 other choices accompany every entree. &#160;There was so much food, in fact, that I had leftovers for 2 days. &#160;The only reason I don't rate this place higher is that I never got to see the nightlife aspect, which looked very promising. &#160;There's also an upstairs lounge area, which fits about 30 people. &#160;Our host pointed out that this area can be reserved in advance at no charge. &#160;I imagine you at least have to have a minimum bar tab though. &#160;Anyway, we also found out from our host that this is the only Haitian Restaurant currently open on the entire west coast. &#160;If for nothing else, that's at least worth giving it a try.
I like to corrupt people. Or, to put in another way, spread the decadence. So, after an evening of drinking flight after flight of barleywine down at Beveridge, we needed sustenance. Desperately.Not only did I introduce one member of my trio entourage to the wonderful world of barleywine, but I managed to introduce both to the equally wonderful world of poutine. Is there anything better than a mound of french fries, bathed in savory brown gravy, studded with salty cheese curds? Highly doubtful...unless you're entirely sober. In which case, yes. But in which case, there might be other equally tempting options on Shadowland's menu, like a baguette with cucumber and brie, or a tasty half-chicken, or a piled-high-on-marbled-rye pastrami sandwich? Or Ninkasi's Total Domination IPA? Ah, yes. Never too much barleywine for me to still have Ninkasi....And can't complain about plenty of open space and a back booth on a Saturday night, friendly service, and the short yet inclusive (carnivore and veggie friendly) menu! While my sojourns to West Seattle are few, it's good to know I have a stop to make on the way home. The first time I came to Shadowland I had the best beer of my life and poutine and that was it, I fell in love. I'm easy, I know, but sometimes you just know when it's meant to be. Since then the beer has disappeared and a little of the new love gloss has gone off of our relationship. I'm still interested though, and we both hold on to the good times, looking forward to that spark again in the future, and remember the magic we knew. I still believe, Shadowland. And you still have the sweetness about you that a good poutine brings, and I love the smiles that come my way from the servers, dressed all in black in your cozy low lighting. And sometimes we laugh together at your taste in music, but I've always loved watching the game with you. Came in for HH (4pm-6pm) and $25 bucks bought us:3 beers (Snow Cap)Bowl of steamed clams (no charge for extra bread, thankya!)Hummus plate (never seen one presented like this - very cool)Pulled pork sliders and fries (fries were greasy, boo)A really random but fun soundtrack (Frank Sinatra to Pink Floyd to Prince)Quick, pleasant service (how do you take clams to go? they'll show you here!)Good people watching (many regulars greeted by name)Another great find in the Junction! Shadowland's bar staff is VERY good. &#160;Unfortunately we didn't get the name of our bartender ("your server is "Bartender"") otherwise I'd give him a shout out - he was attentive, prompt, friendly, and helpful.Food:Cheeseburger FTW! &#160;Cooked just right, filling, tastyFish &amp; chips: &#160;nice that it wasn't a huge ass plate of greasy goodness - proportioned just rightBeer: &#160;well, what is there to say about that? &#160;Cocktails: &#160;mixed to a teeCrowd: &#160;umm...so...yeah. &#160;Interesting. &#160;That's all I can say.Atmosphere: &#160;good, upbeatWe were there during kexp's hood to hood challenge - bummer was that it was cold and raining SIDEWAYS, which made for a miserable walk around Wee Sea. &#160;Finding 2 seats at Shadowland made it better, though! Brunch was great with goat cheese Omelet and the typical bar crowd. There were a handful of folks watching the game and the waitress was attentive and helpful. &#160;The Omelet was fantastic, tasty and everything you'd expect at a nice restaurant. &#160;All in all, it's a great value and not bad. &#160;I wanna come back for drinks at night! OMG LOVE IT! Yeah I could eat here everyday if I could, darn if only Shadowland could open another restaurant in the heart of Downtown. So the Boyfriend and I went cause he decided to purchase some groupon tickets and got $40 off our delightful meal. THANK YOU! I said. :D So upon be waited to be seated which didn't take long since it wasn't real busy, we decided to sit at a high table and chairs in the bar area and let me tell you this place rocks! They have a variety of different cocktails, wine and of couse beer! We got a bottle of wine and which went perfect with the Braised Beef ShortRibs I had for dinner, so much flavor and so tender, I would def. get that dish again. It was a great experience, so if you live in the area or just visiting there in West Seattle this is a place you need to try out cause I'm so glad I did! We went to Shadowland for drinks with friends last night and had a great time. &#160;The place was pretty empty on a Tuesday night but filled up a bit more by the time I left (10pm-ish). &#160;All my friends enjoyed their drinks. &#160;The food was a little disappointing. &#160;Decent prices but very small portions. &#160;My friends ordered the macaroni and cheese with broccoli (comes with bacon too) and they thought it was the best mac &amp; cheese they've had. &#160;Will go back. Christmas lights in a fishbowl. As a lamp. AWESOME!I love the decor at Shadowland! Very modern, a little dark, and incredibly creative. The televisions seem a little bit out of place since it feels more like a lounge than a sports bar, but since there was a good game on the tube, I was down for that. It really worked. Awesome, attentive service. The wine selection was a bit lacking, with no Washington red wines, but since I was sticking to beer, it didn't bother me too much.All in all, a really solid watering hole! good food - good crowd. &#160;Great place for a drink after work to chat with friends. During the week of New Years we came to visit a friend in West Seattle and came to 'the junction'. Shadowlands was such a good place that we came back here twice. Very good cocktails. We got the mac and cheese, hummus, and chicken strips. And they were sooo good that we got the same thing and just moved one person to the left to try what we missed. Shadowland taught me that Spam is totally delicious fried up and sandwiched between fluffy egg and melty cheese. I can't wait to go back.I liked the variety on their menu. Everything we ordered was fresh and tasty. Also, it's conveniently located about a block from a big free parking lot.The service was pretty good, though I ordered a beer listed as "on tap" and they brought me a bottle.The only real detractor when we went was the live music - some guy with an acoustic guitar that would randomly strum and ramble for a few minutes, then stop long enough that they'd finally turn up the bar music. Then he'd suddenly start playing over top of the bar music, so they'd finally turn it off and then he would stop playing and just ramble again. Awesome.
GROSS!!!! A dump with trash for food!**Clean the damn tables** Sorry about my Tourettes, they often speak the truth. I gave this place multiple tries but the last time sent me sprinting. I ordered the chicken quesadilla thinking it's nearly impossible to mess up: cheese, chicken, wrap, BAMM!! Quesadilla manifested! However, I was sincerely proven wrong! There was a LONG STRIP OF BLACK HAIR at the bottom of my plate. At first, I thought it was a skinny noodle. You know how certain restaurants like McDonald's diversify your mcnuggets with one fry just to add flare. Not in this case. I tracked down the cook with the long hair with equivalent length in hair. There are only two other cooks. She smiled and replied word-for-word, "Yes??" WTF?? What do you mean, "Yes?" I would like a refund please! She said, "Let's make you a brand new quesadilla instead?" &#160;Excuse me!! That's the problem!! I don't want another quesadilla. After 10minutes I finally got a refund.  YOU MUST BE OUT OF YOUR MIND TO COME HERE EVEN ONCE! Just no.Much better places on the Ave.Had sushi here---it was terrible. A big tall sweaty guy made it. &#160;Fairly expensive for the Ave. I've only had the Spicy Teriyaki, and boy, it is HOT! &#160;I must not be used to this level of spice, but my eyes water and my ears begin to hurt and feel pressure. &#160;yikes! But for some reason I kept eating it. &#160;I haven't been here in a while, but I've never had spicy Teriyaki anywhere else. &#160;The prices can get a little high. &#160;It's not amazing food, but I've had friends who've eaten there just because of convenience in location and selection and it's not half bad. &#160;BTW, walking out of there your clothes will wreak of food smell. &#160;Not good when you have to go to class and everyone around you is not pleased by your scent. Food is terrible.No possible way to serve quality food with such a small kitchen and such a vast menu.I gave 2 stars solely because I was able to watch the NBA playoffs here after finishing my nasty food.I have a stomach ache now. as a former college student and a korean, i gotta say that prices aren't great and the portion was disappointingly small. (i had korean bbq short ribs for $10)you have a lot of other choices in the area. go somewhere else for a better deal.
Who puts coffee in a glass cup? Well she put my 16oz cappuccino in one. I feel like I'd be doing a disservice to UW students and coffee drinkers by giving this place such a terrible review. I'm not a regular coffee drinker, but from what my friends say, their coffee is pretty amazing. I do, however, love their pastries and the atmosphere.What I don't like is when I get my bank statement and I find that they've charged me more than what I signed to pay. Twice before, when I looked up my online bank statement, I've been over-charged by Solstice, but by a few cents, so I thought it might've been a mistake or maybe there was a surcharge for credit transactions that I didn't know of. Still, I was definitely suspicious.And then I went there 4 days ago (1/19/2011) for a bagel that cost me $2.50, and I definitely made sure to keep the receipt. I just checked my online statement, and I was charged $3.50! Now I know there's no way that's a transaction fee, I didn't even get a coffee drink so I didn't think it warranted a tip (I've been a barista, I know the etiquette), and even for a $1 tip at a coffee shop, at least don't treat me and your other customers like we're such an inconvenience! Honestly, if it wasn't for location, this place would've closed years ago. &#160;The food is over priced and nothing special. &#160;There is nowhere to plug in your laptop, thus limiting your time unless you've got a spare battery (I don't). &#160;The music is often too loud for conversation. &#160;I don't like the atmosphere and I never stay. &#160;Yes, it's a decent cup of tea, but it is served with attitude. &#160;I didn't order attitude. &#160;In fact, there is only one barista who ever smiles at me and I groan a little when he's not on duty. &#160;If only there was another place in the U-district that served a good cup of herbal tea! Solstice toes the line between bar (serves beer and wine, has loud music) and coffee shop (coffee, pastries, etc.). For some people, that is clearly a positive, but I just can't get into it. The coffee is fine and the baked goods are yummy, but the vibe in the place turns me off. The music is a bit loud. It can be hard to get a table, and I like my beer and my espresso separate. Solstice is one of my favorite coffee shops on the Ave, mostly due to the atmosphere (wooden tables with mismatched chairs, art on the walls, hipsters errywhere) and the fact that they can usually make a decent cup of coffee. Usually. Once I got a cup of drip with grounds in it and swore I'd never go back. Obviously I lied, but luckily there's been no tragic coffee mishaps since then. Their pastries are delicious, as are their teas. In the summer, their little sidewalk patio is good for chilling in the shade with an iced Americano.My only gripe (aside from the aforementioned grounds-in-my-drip fiasco) is the music. For a hipsterly coffee shop that caters largely to students who *gasp* study there, they sure do play the hip-hop at high decibels. Great espresso just too damn LOUD! 4 stars for good coffee and a cool space. Negative 2 stars for attitude and non-working wifi (and unapologetic baristas). Not wasting any more money there. I haven't done the review thing in a while, but I come here often enough that I feel the need to add my two cents (Solstice has gotten quite a bit more than that from my paltry bank account over the years.) I have mixed feelings about Solstice. I like the food/tea/drink selections. I strongly dislike the surly attitudes. I have 3 audiences for this review.Audience One: Would-be entrepreneurs on the lower AvePlease consider opening a good quality coffee shop with friendly service! We are surprisingly lacking in that department (except the Ugly Mug, but it's small, and there often is no room to sit).Audience Two: Potential customersPastries: very good; espresso drinks: sometimes cold, but generally fine; Herbal tea selection: very good; music: I like it, but yes, it's often very loud; layout: good space; back patio: nice outdoor seating except everyone smokes, so not too enjoyable from a fresh air perspective; WiFi: mostly unusable unless the place is pretty empty; baristas: some very, very unfriendly (to the point of rude) male baristas who are always there during the dayAudience Three: Solstice staffConsider an employee shakeup. It's hard, and I pretty much never say this, but it's really necessary in this case. Enjoy what you're doing or find a new line of work. Treat your customers as your livelihood, which we are.My partner and I have been saying for a long time that we were going to stop coming here. I think it's about time to finally fulfill that vow. I am a pretty good customer because I work in retail...I always tip and say please and thank you. I don't spend two hours counting change out of my purse, and I don't make picky requests. Everyone who works behind the counter here always acts pissed, like you did something wrong by ordering an Americano. All I can say is screw you, and I hope someone nice eventually gets your job. Very unique vibe. &#160;A definite study bar. &#160;Most of the time the place is blasting really loud (and generally good) music while the students hack away on their laptops. &#160;You CAN meet people here, but it's hard, most are just there to get their shit done.A couple baristas are nice and a couple have been there for way too long and quite short with you.There is kind of a cold vibe here in general...drinks are expensive...and the place is super loud... I come to solstice because it's right next to school and their coffee is decent albeit a bit expensive. However some of the servers seriously need an attitude check. Everytime I go in there I always feel like I am inconveniencing the staff. if it weren't so close to class, I would rather just go to another coffee shop.edit: 11/17/10 - I went in to buy a coffee and a white chocolate banana bread today which btw the bread was absolutely de-li-cious. &#160;and the guy barista actually asked me how I am doing today...wow....i am in shock and so i have to up the rating from a 3 star to a 4 star just for that :) Aw, I still heart you, Cafe Solstice! Thanks for giving me fabulously rich and smooth Americanos and artful lattes. Solstice is a great cafe, one of my favorites on the ave. Their coffee (like most other shops) is a bit over-priced for what the quality can be sometimes, but their drip is decent and they serve beer &amp; wine as well.The music can often be way too loud, and makes it hard (not impossible) to have a conversation inside/do homework. I love the outdoor patio/smoking section out back. It's a lot quieter and pretty cute, the only problem being that there are usually no tables open. But at least I have somewhere to sit, smoke &amp; drink coffee. Overall the vibe is unique and interesting, so I believe Solstice is worth at least one visit.
great pasta salads and heavy pizza, more bang for your buck and they deliver which is great when you are hung over..
Great little cafe! 4.25 stars! &#160;Love it especially for the PRICE. &#160;Even in ID you'd be hard pressed to find a place that'll get you super full for lunch (maybe even some leftovers for an afternoon snack) for under $5! &#160;I've had noodles, pho, bahn mi, and one of the buns here. &#160;Everything is really tasty -- but again, I must emphasize the low price, haha. &#160;Would be 3.5 star otherwise. &#160;Best deal is the bahn mi, which not only is cheap, but also the best I've had so far in the area (will update if I find better).
You got Pho and you got those cream puffs, all for super cheap!It's all done simple and to the point. This is why I go here more than any other Pho place on the Hill. Service is incredibly fast, Pho always delicious, and damn those cream puffs melt me!My favorite Pho: Steak &amp; Tripe. Yes, everyone cringes when I eat it up but I cant help myself. I'm also prone to buying extra cream puffs just because I'm a glutton... fun facts - round one!1. pho is the ultimate hangover cure2. a small tofu and a lemonade comes out to $6.663. 99% of the people who eat at than bros go on to become nobel prize winnersok, so that last one isn't true. but dammit come here anyway! you don't know what you're missing...
Ok, gave this place a second chance since they're the closest Indian restaurant from school.Food: Solid 3 stars. &#160;It's fits the definition "A-OK" perfectly. &#160;The food is good, not spectacular, not inedible. But, those cheats OVERCHARGED us. &#160;Ordered the chicken sandwich and the chicken curry off of the penny pincher menu, made it very clear we were ordering off of the penny pincher menu. &#160;That should be 6.75+6.95+tax. &#160;How did it come to $17?? &#160;Considering they charged $17 flat, I'm guessing that there wasn't any REAL number crunching involved. &#160;I did the math, the tax would have to be around 25% for the final cost to be near $17. &#160;I hate dishonest businesses. Check your bill before you pay to make sure you're not cheated as well!!!!! I usually go here for lunch to get one of the penny pincher specials ... which usually ends up being one of their open-faced naan sandwiches and a mango lassi. I'm not sure whether other Indian places do this type of dish, but I think it is a great idea. You get a full piece of Naan covered in yummy goodness. I've also had the Tikka Masala and Butter Chicken here and they taste pretty typical, nothing that blows you away, but not bad either. Unfortunately, the spice level at this place is a bit lacking on most of the other dishes I've tasted.Overall, they are a decent spot on the Ave for lunch/dinner. But I wouldn't go so far to say they are the best Indian in town or even in the near vicinity. If the open-faced naan sandwiches are hard to come by then I would recommend you try it out just for the sandwiches!Oh and they also do popular dishes on pasta now, too. Different and a bit strange, but I hear it's good. I work at UW and enjoy going here for lunch. I love their Penny Pincher Specials, especially the Chicken Vindaloo. YUM! &#160;I also like to get their Naan and a Mango Lassi for a drink and dessert. This place is good, if you order the signature items they know how to cook.I ordered the shrimp openface sandwich on naan. Since it was about half the price of the larger signature entrees like chicken tandoori, I figured it would be small yet meticulously prepared. I'd been to Shalimar once before and thoroughly enjoyed a heavily discounted ($9) chicken masala (I think) special. I also figured the shrimp would be decent, because this is Seattle. My experience was quite the opposite.First off, the sandwich was HUGE. Take your average dinner plate, then make it bigger and more oblong, then pile 3 inches of white rice across the whole thing. The naan was the size of a horse's face and was too chewy to eat, the shrimp was dry and could have been dried to begin with, and the rice was decent, but... it was just rice. All in all, with the exception of a mound of sauce in one corner I mistakenly ate in a single bite, it was dry and near inedible. Lots of food for $7, but hardly even worth it.Stick to the signature dishes: meat with curry sauce and rice. Even the IPA seemed a little off. And if you're sensitive to spice like me, definitely go mild/very mild as well. My dad got medium chicken tandoori and, albeit tasty, it made me cry.Service was decent but nothing noteworthy. I always order a water without ice and they never managed to pull that off despite my cries of discontentment. Our server, who I believe was the owner's daughter, was very nice though, and very attractive :D. I'm spoiled with good Indian food in the Bay area. The chicken tikka masala was waaay too westernized. The food is decent, though not spectacular, but I find everything here to be overpriced. &#160;The atmosphere is clean and open and comfortable, though the service is a little slow, usually. &#160;The "penny pincher" menu is nice, though I hardly order off of it. &#160;I enjoy the variety of items and that my "extra spicy" dishes actually come out fairly spicy (I like my food reaaaaally spicy). &#160;It's the closest Indian restaurant on The Ave, so it's convenient, or else we wouldn't come here. Closed on Sundays.... I guess they don't want our business. No matter, we went to their competition and had a GREAT meal... From now on, we know where to go and what to avoid.
This is my go-to spot to get a Vietnamese sandwich. &#160;It's hard to beat a quick and relatively healthy lunch for less than $3. &#160;Unless you're a vegetarian, the best sandwich is the BBQ pork. &#160;This is also my go-to spot if I'm going to a party and looking for a tasty finger dish to bring. &#160;I've ordered a platter of egg rolls (cut in half), so if I order 30 egg rolls at 50 cents a piece, it's very reasoanble priced platter and they're always a hit at parties. &#160;The only con is the parking situation. &#160;At busy times, it may be hard to find a spot and the lot has an awkward lay out. &#160;Also, CASH ONLY! Good sandwich for $2.75, it takes longer than it would at subway but the value is way greater. You will find very hard working people there, looks like a family owned shop and it opens from 7 to 7, 7 days a week. Get the number one bahn mi. Grilled pork on a great baguette with cilantro, jalapeno and some tasty mayonnaise kind of spread. So awesome and at $2.75, you cannot beat it for a great lunch.I have tried the other well known bahn mi place nearby and after several tries of both, I vote for the Seattle deli as the winner. I will be honest, I have not tried anything else here, but it is hard to not order something this good and this cheap.
"Love the food: hate the parking" reviewer has a good point. Their parking lot is tiny. &#160;However, there is decent parking on the street and in the vicinity, and the food and great, really low prices have convinced me to park and walk a few steps more than once. This isn't a restaurant, by the way. It really is a "Walk-in-and-buy-your-food-and-leave" deli.Love the banh mi sandwiches, like everyone else, and also they have these noodle-goodness containers right near the check-out that used to be a staple for me. (Now that I live farther away, they must be a treat instead. Boo.) &#160;The containers have different types of meat on top of a pile of luscious noodles with some veggie goodness and sauce crowning the top. I prefer the ones with a cut-up eggroll included on top.They also serve a mean Vietnamese coffee, and walking past here on my way to anywhere serves as a good enough reason to stop by and order up a cup of that sweet, condensed milk goodness.Much of the rest of the food in the deli is a mystery to me -- a delightful one that keeps me coming back and trying doggedly to learn something about this cuisine. So far, I'm enjoying the food a ton: learning slowly but eating quickly. :) Best vietnamese sandwich place around Seattle!!
Love the food. &#160;Hate the parking. &#160;I'm naming it the Vietnamese 7-11.
I've ordered banh mi thit nuong here since college. &#160;I still believe they have the best thit nuong hands-down. &#160;Here are some tips to make your experience better:1. If you order banh mi thit nuong during rush hour (between 11-2), you &#160;may want to consider calling in your order first. That way, you won't be faced with the "oh, we'll have it in 10-15 minutes".2. Cafe sua da. Always and forever.3. &#160;Pack patience for the parking situation.4. Try a dessert or two. They are authentic and nummy.5. If you see that the loaves of cha lua (vietnamese ham) are hot, get one! In the International District, there are so many of these delis that you have no idea which ones are good. &#160;The only way is to buy and try as they are cheaper than anything you can get outside of the value menu at fast food joints. &#160;Seattle Deli trumps most of the ones in the surrounding 4 block radius as everything that I purchased that day exceeded my expectations. &#160;TIP: you may want to wasp down to an ATM machine or bank to secure cash money before heading over. &#160; Here is a sampling of what you will find:The Vietnamese Sandwiches (B&#225;nh m&#236;), are nearly perfect as they have just the right proportions of meat and veggies. &#160;In my case, I ordered the shredded pork and also the special (has a bit of everything). &#160;"Ch&#232; ", pronounced like Cherry but without the "re", is a traditional Vietnamese dessert soup or others refer to it as pudding. &#160;I saw at least 7 or 8 different varieties of ch&#232; and chose my favorite one (I think is called Ch&#232; Thung (?)). &#160;This dessert is an off white color and has dates, jellies and tapioca. &#160;So far, I don't know of any place that tops their version of this delight."X&#244;i", pronounced soy is an often sweet (but not always) Vietnamese dish made from glutinous rice. &#160;We call it sweet or sticky rice. &#160;They have several varieties of these as well wrapped in saran wrap on stryofoam plates ready for mass consumption. &#160;Looked delicious but I was strapped for cash and didn't want to leave the food sitting in my hot car all day so I will try that another day.Also it is important to note that they have a buffet style setup that you can get portions of different Vietnamese dishes with rice. &#160;Vietnamese normally call this "com phan"; com is Vietnamese for rice and phan is Vietnamese for portion....thus a "rice portion" consists of Vietnamese entrees accompanied with rice. &#160;How it works is that you can order a couple (or more) of selections from the "buffet" and they pack it with steamed rice so you can have a family meal at home without slaving in the kitchen after a hard's day at work.All in all, great place for B&#225;nh m&#236; and snackies in the ID with the low prices we expect from Vietnamese delis. &#160;I cannot wait to drop by there again to try out the other items from their assortment of goodies. &#160;Just remember that, like most places of its kind, it is a cash only establishment, there is no seating area (to go only), and parking is a pain in the rear. I am cheating with writing this review because I haven't actually set foot in Seattle Deli. However, my friend grabbed a few of their chicken Vietnamese sandwiches to eat on our hike yesterday and it was so good that I almost died! I didn't die, so I decided to yelp about it instead. We also had egg rolls and the word on the street is that the grand total for 4 sandwiches and 4 egg rolls was only $12.00. Whaaaaaaaaat? $12.00 for 4 egg rolls AND 4 to die for chicken sandwiches with sprouts, carrots, peppers and some kind of magic sauce?I love this town. Great sandwiches. Can't beat the prices. A nice little kept secret in the heart of Seattle. Now if they would just open one up on the Eastside. Good cheap sandwiches, the rice dishes off to side are also good and worth a try. The Banh mi combo rocks! For $2.25, you can't go wrong. &#160;CASH ONLY Pros: Very affordable, quick service, fresh food!Cons: ParkingOverall I like Seattle Deli the best compared to all the other Deli. It is no secret that Seattle Deli has some of the best bahn mi in the International District. I will agree with some reviewers that occasionally the bread is a little under baked, but I will overlook that because the pork is so completely delicious. Huge slabs of grilled, fatty pork meat with cilantro, homemade aoli, cucumber, daikon and pickled carrot. Droooool. &#160;And the space is shared with some great baked goods, cold desserts, and a hot food bar. Treat yourself to some of the best iced coffee, some salad rolls with tons of fresh herbs and a bahn mi and you have yourself a nice picnic lunch. (one thing worth mentioning is that this is a cash only establishment with a somewhat perplexing ordering system. Try to get the eye of one of the cashiers, they take your order and then when your order is up, you pay.) one of my favorite stops for vietnamese food (when i can't harass my mama for some)if you're not too familiar with vietnamese food and wanna try something out side of banh mi you should try their banh coun (rice roll with pork stuffing) most of the trays up by the register are pretty safe to explore for a good sized lunch and usually a good price (i think i got 3 trays for less than $15 once?)i haven't tried their banh mi b/c i like a different place around the corner but i know the bread they use there can be bought by itself and those are usually really good, especially if they have bo kho/beef stew in their hot bar that you can dip the bread intoparking can suck. all super cheap &amp; great for lunches, though cash only. a winner when i'm looking for quick food to go I love me some banh mi. I try to eat one a couple of times a month. I finally made it to Seattle Deli this weekend after much delay. It was packed on a Sunday (it's small but there must've been 25 people inside)- but somehow they are still able to move people in and out quickly without inconvenience. The sandwich was excellent. I had the BBQ Pork and the Special. Both were excellent with the Special taking the cake as my favorite. $2.50 and 2.75 respectively. The price is right, and I'm a huge fan. I will be back and will be bringing my appetite. Definitely solid place to get your cheap delicious sandwich. Not much of a fan of their BBQ pork sandwich...seems a little dried and too fatty with their generous helping of mayo and fat from the meat..I definitely like their special and bi. This past June I had the amazing opportunity of traveling around Southeast Asia for three and a half weeks. Perhaps it is all the Anthony Bourdain episodes or just my love of all things new but I was instantly drawn to the food carts and any place that was packed with locals. Nothing I had tasted like the proclaimed "Asian" food that I had tried in America before my trip. Upon my arrival home I was suffering from serious actual Asian food withdrawal. I wandered around the International District and found multiple places that offered similar food but there was something missing. Then I remembered Seattle Deli. Not only does their food taste as authentic as it gets, they have a huge selection of things that most Americans would never try simply due to their somewhat obscure appearance but that many food vendors in Asia sell. I sat outside with my huge bounty (I think I got something like ten different foods for about 12 dollars), tryings bits of everything, smiling at the thought that just like in Asia it is possible to get huge amounts of food for nearly no money, and felt, even if just for a second, that I was back on the streets of Luang Prabang. I've had the chicken and pork banh mi here. Both super tasty. I don't have much experience with banh mi so I have nothing to compare to except for the banh mi I've had at Saigon Deli in the U District, but I'd say the banh mi here is better. I want to buy this whole deli and try everything they sell here because everything looks so good. This is my neighborhood Vietnamese deli and I am a fan of the food not the parking.I believe that this place have the best &amp; cheapest prices for banh mi, some assortments but the space is smaller then Tonys.They have variety of other hot foods but you have to be aggressive on ordering and if you don't mind being elbow by another customer. The ordering can be a challenge since the lines can merge with people just waiting for their banh mi. &#160;They only accept cash so make sure you have cash.I grab a few Vietnamese sandwiches to take with me to the Seahawks Playoff game and it was crazy...super crowded &amp; got trap in the parking lot.The parking lot is very small and I recommend parking on the street if you don't want to get trap in the parking lot or go on a week day when it is less traffic then the weekends.Overall the prices are super great, quality of food is tasty, and great for a budget meal or stock up on Vietnamese sandwiches for students going to college like my friend. lol &#160;It is a great change of pace when you don't want top ramen, for the college kids. They deserve the four stars.I recommend any banh mi and you must try the egg rolls...so good. My favorite place to get Pork Bahn Mi! I seriously can get a Pork Bahn Mi and their Vermicelli noodles for under $10. They have so much kinds of food ranging from a hot line to baked goods. Also, make sure you bring cash since this is a CASH ONLY joint. Definitely the place to go when you're hungry and you have slightly less than $5 in your pocket. BBQ pork sandwich is all I need to give this place 5 stars. Very tasty and very cheap. A++++ would eat again!Price has been raised from $2.25 to $2.75. LOWERING ONE STAR I love Vietnamese delis.....honestly the food here is always of great quality....it's pretty much what you would get at many restaurants without all the fancy garnishings and the service but at much cheaper prices! The banh mi thit nuong (grilled pork), banh mi thit ngoui (cold cut pork) and banh mi bi (fatty pork rine) are the best sandwiches by far! I can eat food from here every single meal of the day.....I usually just go after I get out of Church from up the street.... This is my favorite place to get my banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) fix. &#160;I always get either a grilled pork or grilled chicken or both! &#160;And, at $2.25 - $2.50 they're a total steal! &#160;The ingredients they use are so fresh from the crusty french baguette to the pickled vegetables, cucumbers, jalapenos and cilantro. &#160;On a hot day when I'm in the mood for a salad, I like to get the bun (rice noodle salad) for lunch. It's quite filling yet light with a good portion of rice noodles, lettuce, basil, mint, cilantro and egg rolls and/or grilled pork. Other staples I like to get from here every time I visit are their goi cuon (fresh spring rolls) and their yummy rice cakes. &#160;The goi cuon are made with thin slices of shrimp and pork with lettuce, mint and cilantro. &#160;Two come in a package along with a peanut dipping sauce. &#160;There are also a variety of different rice cakes I like. &#160;My favorite kind are the striped ones (usually green &amp; yellow or pink &amp; green) that are made with either tapioca or pandan. They are so good and so pretty. Seattle Deli has so many food options and the prices are great! I only come here for one reason and one reason only, its their Banh Mi Thit Nuong. &#160;I don't get anything else. &#160;I just get this. &#160;I request that they toast the bread so its warm when I eat it. &#160;Otherwise, if you're looking for something else in their line of sandwiches or other offerings, you'll be utterly disappointed because their Banh Thit Nuong is that GOOD! &#160;The service is fabulous and this is one of the few areas where I would speak Vietnamese to. &#160;They are friendly and easy to deal with! NEW Favorite.I saw this in Seattle Magazine top 48 sandwiches... so I had to go! After yelping it (yelp's amazing) I realized it's literally two blocks from my house. So, I'm kind of now obsessed and have been maybe 3 times this week? Yea... I know. For 2$ I honestly couldn't believe it. My fav is the tofu. They have this awesome sauce on it that totally makes it! The bread is nice and crispy. It also has a kick to it that I can appreciate. Besides the sandwiches, they have all kinds of fun things here. Sticky rice, fried bananas, and a whole slough of things that look delicious. You must stop in. Bring your change... it's cash only. College student haven! I love the I.D. - try me! Doesn't look like they need another review from me. &#160;But yummy sandwiches and spring rolls -- so cheap. &#160;And blisteringly fast -- hard to park -- a few times I've had to go elsewhere because parking was impossible that day. I'm in full agreement with those who love the - BBQ Pork Banh Mi Sandwich [$2.50]:crunchy, salty delicious porkwith a full salad worth of pickles, carrots, other greens, aiolifresh crunchy breadI love this completely and at this price pointits better than any sub sandwich I've ever had at Quizno's or Subway at twice [or thrice] the price.....- Wet Spring Rolls [$2 for 2 rolls]:decent preparation of vietnamese- style rollstasty dipping &#160;sauce;super valueTake out only;the line can seems chaoticno tables, so you'll have to eat it elsewhereID parking is always problematic Oh hell yeah! &#160;FOUR sandwiches for $10, and a study in perfectly executed unpretentious simplicity. &#160;It's all weird and confusing and hectic and makes me want to return for exactly those reasons. &#160;5 stars if I spoke Vietnamese - can't even figure out how to order half of the stuff here (even after asking the staff.) Solid Vietnamese deli in the ID. Similar to Saigon Deli, though I like the selection here better. Plus they have some parking here which is something.I don't think I have ever been here where there was not some line. It is a popular place! They have banh mi sandwiches, spring rolls, egg rolls, pate chaud, rice noodle dishes and a reasonably priced Vietnamese hot food bar. To compliment the meal, they also sell drinks, desserts and snacks.Tried the chicken ($2.25) and BBQ pork ($2.50) banh mi. The chicken was fine. The mayo does seem to play a big part here. The chicken is the kind you would expect at a teriyaki place. Decent, considering the price. It is really the veggies that makes the sandwiches work. The BBQ pork was a little better than the chicken one. Though I think it is better eaten on the spot. It just does not taste as good reheated. The sandwiches at Seattle are good, but I have to say New Saigon Deli down the road from here is still my favorite.Also got a side order of the spring rolls ($2). They were fresh, but you still want to eat them on the same day because of the shrimp. I don't think it keeps long unfortunately. While you are at it, try the egg rolls. So crispy and cheap. How can you not spare 50 cents for a bite of this fried excellence?Seattle Deli is a solid choice for Vietnamese deli fare. You can't really go too wrong with any of the delis in the ID given the pricing, but Seattle is my choice if you care most about selection. Simply put best sandwich I've ever had.I had the BBQ Pork and it is the best sandwich I've eaten from any establishment, ever. Simple, tasty, cheap, fabulous.(parking kinda sucks though) Chicken Bahn Mi - no mayo. &#160;That's what I get when I walk in and make eye contact with whoever is behind the counter. &#160;Seriously, that's all that's needed. &#160;I go here so often, I don't even have to say a word! &#160; &#160;I pay the $2.25 and end up with the best lunch ever.I used to check in on my yelp app once in a while, but didn't want to look like a freak with 253 check-ins...cause that's exactly what would happen if I checked in everytime I came here - which is on average, 4 times a week. &#160;No joke. This place is a hidden jewel (at least for the non-Asian Belltown resident). I am always amused that a place called "Seattle Deli" would be a Vietnamese store with minimal English being spoken. I get the bahn mi sandwiches (which are two dollars and change) - they're great, not very consistent in which ingredients they use or how much of certain ingredients they have, but always great! Great price, great food - can't ask for more. Call ahead for a large order. Parking can be a pain. They also have a menu posted in English, which is awesome. They only take cash, but it's so cheap, it doesn't matter. By now, after all the reviews they've gotten, when they've consistently maintained such a stellar score, you know the drill. These guys make great sandwiches for an incredibly cheap price. And good for them.It's a funky cool setting that lets you know you're in town, that's for sure. There's not a lot of parking, there's not a lot of free space to roam around once you get in here. There's not a lot of english being spoken. You know you're arrived at a hub of activity once you get here.It's a simple commercial space, lots of windows, a big roll-up garage door that's actually just a window since it doesn't appear to go all the way to the floor. And from all the hundreds of times I've driven by this place without seeing it rolled up, it might not actually have the roll-up thingy it seems to have, either, so it might not be a roll-up garage door in the slightest.Anyway, there are tons and tons of different items in shrink wrap and in plastic tubs for sale here. You see people shopping for their weekly family meals here, especially on Sundays, walking out with armloads of plastic bugs packed to the top with all different appetizers and soups and sauces, ready to go feed the relatives.But the focal point for most of us is the banh mi. And they're just great. Crunchy, crusty bread, brightly flavored pickled bits, lots of lovely grilled meat. Natually, they were out of the bbq pork by the time I got there, but I asked anyway, hoping against hope. With a pop, my two sandwiches came to under $6. Such a steal. I won't say they're the best banh mi in town; I put Yeh Yeh's or Pho 36 at the top of that list for now. But they're damn good. My favorite banh mi joint in all of Seattle! &#160;If you want to order a banh mi though, you have to be assertive and make your way to the front when it's packed. &#160;You can't be shy here. &#160;They're also happy to make it to order, so feel free to ask for extra peppers, not toasted or vegetables on the side, etc. &#160;I also like some of the packaged Vietnamese deli treats on the front counter by the register (fresh rolls with shrimp and banh cuon). &#160;Their vegetarian egg noodle chow mein and the green beans from the hot section are also good. &#160;You could get yourself delicious lunch, dinner and dessert from here for all under $10. &#160;Although there is plenty of street parking, it gets to be a mad house during busy hours, so try and beat the crowds if you can. Best Banh Mi, best prices and really convenient, quick service. &#160;They also carry some delicious sweets like sesame crackers and coconut patties found in the "grocery" part. &#160;If only there was a table or two, it would be even better. &#160;But, it's a great place to pick up some sandwiches and snacks to enjoy at Hing Hay Park. Yum! I've eaten their Banh Mi sandwiches (the "special" kind) sooo many times, I can't count.This is a great place to go to if you need to grab food on the go! They have many types of Vietnamese types of food, including the sandwiches, pastries, egg rolls, rice, drinks, dessert,--pretty much any typical Vietnamese snack type foods. Their pricing is great! It's average for the sandwich (ranges around $2.50-$3) and if the carryout lunch meal (take out box with fried or white rice, and your choice of two side dishes, is $5!) The only con is that they only take cash. So be prepared to have some on you-No ATM nearby, that I know of. The location is alright, but parking is the hard part. The lot they have can only fit say...like 7 parked cars. You most likely will have to park on the street, however it is usually filled. But, you could run in and grab what you want if you already know, and come right out within less than 3 minutes, if you decided to ditch looking for a parking space. Service is fast. Which is another pro. You order what you want, they give it to you, you pay, and you are out the door! They opened another chain down by highway 99. I've tried their sandwiches there, but still think the ID is the best. &#160;Pros: -Fast service-Cheap eats-Variety of goods Cons:-Minimal parking spaces-Pay in Cash only-Lots of people A couple weeks ago, I stopped by to grab a grilled pork sandwich right before they were closing, and it was not good :( &#160;The bread wasn't crispy, and the sandwich ingredients were subpar. &#160;I was so disappointed....but was hoping that it was just a fluke... and IT WAS! &#160;I stopped by again a few days ago, and had the BEST sandwich ever! &#160;I swear, they must have changed bakeries or something, the bread was dense but crispy and had a slight chew, and the meat and pickled vegetables were all done perfectly. &#160;I want another one right now just thinking about it. &#160;May have to make the trek there for lunch....... This was the original Saigon Deli's location. They sold it in the late 90's..What I like about this place:They offer 2 sizes of Vietnamese coffee.The guy got pissed off that I couldn't understand his Vietnamese. Dude. I'm half-Chinese. WTF!Other then that, they are open later then Saigon Deli, but as for quality on who's better - you be the judge. Few months ago, I would have easily given this place 5 stars. They definitely have very solid and satisfying food. The review may be unfair because I am essentially comparing them to Saigon Deli where the Bahn Mi are superior to Seattle Deli's sandwiches. The problems I have with their Bahn Mi are:- Cucumber is cut very thick - Mayo is not tangy - Meat ( BBQ pork) is overly dry and over-cooked Great thanks to Tony R http://www.yelp.com/user&#8230; for cluing me in on Saigon Deli. Great little Deli for authentic Vietnamese sandwiches. In Seattle, this is the place to get bbq pork sandwiches. I'm also a fan of the shrimp spring rolls. This place is really affordable $2.50 for a sandwich which I can only eat half of. Parking is a little difficult FYI. I got the bbq pork Banh Mi, and the bbq pork itself was very good - not too fatty. However, the bread was a little too hard, almost stale, and there wasn't enough dressing on it so the sandwich was a little too dry. It also could have used more veggies and cilantro in it. On the upside, it was very cheap, like $2.75 cheap, for a huge sandwich. I tried the egg roll and it &#160;was very crispy and messy and the filling was just ok. Cash only! I had forgotten I spent the rest of my cash that morning until I tried to pay the man. He let me write a check though. I've ordered food to go from here plenty of times. It's fast and the food is good. Honest. I know there are probably plenty of other vietnamese delis around the area that I still need to check out.. but seattle deli has so far won my heart. And also Lam's seafood down the street.. (another review later on)...I mainly order their bbq pork banh mi and 2 eggrolls... maybe 3... or 4.. :) Also, their other wrapped packed of food on the front counter is good too. I don't really know the actual dish names but the fresh spring rolls and "lunch boxes" with fresh vermicelli noodles and pork is delish! Can't beat the prices either!!! Need the 1/2 star option on this one. &#160;Really 3 1/2. &#160;Love Bahn Mi and have heard about this place for a long time. &#160;Went at 8am in the morning and the place was packed with people buying their lunch. &#160;Buffet looked good but I didn't know what things were. We got 2 bahn mi's - BBQ (pork was big but to fatty) and the special (3 types of ham) and they were just ok. 2 egg rolls - burnt... 2 spring rolls (dipping sauce spicy and they fell apart really easily), Che The (coconut milk with jellies) - really liked it til we ran out of the coconut milk.....2 humbow - just ok, was expecting bbq pork but it was pork mixture with 1/2 an egg.The salads and rice dishes looked good - will probably go back and try some more. After visiting my uncle's in law clinic, my cousins and I was at Seattle Deli since it was across. One of my cousins keep telling me that the thing cali can't beat seattle is their iced coffee and banh mi thit nuong. He was right for real the iced coffee in here was perfect enough bitterness that sends a kick to my mouth and a little of swetness kick in at the very in and for the banh mi awesome airy and taste like real meat the veggies they stuff in is awesome too after eating that sandwich i wonder where the hell have I been. Best Bon Mi EVER !!!!! &#160;Lots of other tasty looking goodies too! I had a wonderful banh mi at Seattle Deli, just outside of the ID. Pate, several different cold cuts, parsley and other vegetables in a wonderful crusty bread was a great solution to a quick fix with a spicy kick to it. I'll definitely be back I was floored by how cheap this place was. A pate banh mi and a viet coffee came to $3.50 total! It's as if they're competing with other banh mi shops in Hanoi.There's other pastries and steam-table offerings but I didn't try those this visit. It's take-out only with no place to sit and eat.It's a bonus that you can park at its own lot rather than find street parking on the busy streets of the heart of ID. Banh mi is definitely one of my favorite sandwiches. &#160;I am not exactly sure what keeps me wanting more. &#160;The smear of savory pate? &#160;The toasted French bread? &#160;Fresh daikon and carrots? &#160;Cilantro? &#160;Deli meats? &#160;The whole jambalaya? &#160;Probably. &#160;I'm a big fan of the banh mi with BBQ meat, especially pork. &#160;Ahh...Asians and their love for the pig. &#160;It's good stuff! &#160;The banh mi here isn't the best, but it satisfies my cravings. &#160;I think the best banh mi is located at Uwajimaya. &#160;I remember the first time I ate a sandwich from here, I really enjoyed it. &#160;I don't know what happened! &#160;I think it is mostly because of the lack of pate and the freshness of the deli meats. &#160;I really like pate, especially in banh mi. &#160;I was truly missing it. &#160;The freshness of the deli meats is one of the most important parts of the sandwich. &#160;Unfortunately, my favorite part, the bread, it wasn't very fresh either! &#160;It was kind of hard on the outside, and the inside was a weird texture. &#160;Sigh. &#160;I think I'll stick to the sandwiches &#160;from Uwajimaya. On another note, Seattle Deli does carry other Asian goodies. &#160;I'm very interested in trying their sweet items. &#160;They have a sweets bar, where they charge by the size of the container. &#160;The bar is full of sticky snacks that all look tasty.I'd come back to see if it was just an off day, otherwise I'll be sticking to the best! Best tofu bahn mi in Seattle. &#160; Astoundingly, also one of the least expensive. &#160;$2 for a large, delicious, fresh tofu bahn mi. &#160;Delectable sauce (and just the right amount), local tofu, daikon, carrot, peppers-- TWO DOLLARS. &#160; I love those crappy hipster joints that serve inferior "vietnamese sandwiches" for $6-$7. &#160;HA! &#160;Come to the 'Deli and you won't regret it. &#160;Good luck finding a parking spot. alrite so i was on a mission to find Saigon deli when i was riding the 60. as the bus was rolling by, i saw seattle deli and i was like hey, a lonely shop in a corner of a block. so i got off and checked it out and saw 2 of the ppl who were on the bus as well ordering sandwiches. i'm thinking to myself, hey this might be the spot, so i ordered chicken sandwich and bbq pork. both of them were pretty good, but not the best i've had...i'll continue searching around the whole china town.-this place accepts cash only-clean spot and limited parking-serves bubble tea and lots of other deserts including lunch combo This place is great! I love bahn mi - and they have such a great selection. It goes beyond the typical definition of a "deli" - it has about a dozen hot Vietnamese offerings in their display case and a variety of baked goods on their shelves. I was actually a little overwhelmed - it looks so small and unassuming from the street but you walk in surrounded by all of these Vietnamese goodies and for incredible prices! Whether you're a newcomer to Vietnamese cuisine or very well-acquainted with it, you have to try the Seattle Deli! What can you say? &#160;Its cheap and one of the best sandwiches out there. &#160;The BBQ Bahn Mi is the best sandwich possible. &#160;It takes a sec to make but its amazing. &#160;The french bread is perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft and doughy on the inside. &#160;Plenty of veggies with the right amount of BBQ meat in there. &#160;AND ITS LESS THAN $3!!! &#160;Thats the best part. &#160;The egg rolls are awesome too. &#160;One of the hidden gems (i guess not so hidden with the lines at lunchtime) in Seattle. &#160;Great lunch spot or a place to pick up something for later.BTW: &#160;As noted in a lot of reviews, this place takes cash only so stop by an ATM beforehand ALWAYS PACKED!!! ALWAYS!!! GREAT FOOD! CHEAP GREAT FOOD!! I love their egg rolls, especially at $.50 each!! 1 Downside... Cash only. But everything else is awesome! I just realize that the Seattle Deli across from Ranch 99 in Mount Lake Terrace is also owned by the same people that opened the Seattle Deli in ID.This place is a lot smaller so there are less varieties of vietnamese dishes here but their Banh Mi are just as good as the one in the ID.I talked to the owners and it seems like eastsiders are in for a treat. There are plans to open a 3rd Seattle Deli and this time it will be in the Kirkland area. Tofu Bahn Mi. I heart you. After years of driving by this establishment, I finally decided to pull over and investigate. I wanted to buy everything. I tried not to purchase everything, but this was indeed hard. I settled on the tofu bahn mi and cold noodle salad for the old man. My sammich was da bomb. Fresh herbs, crusty bread and tofu. I decided to inquire about the green beverage behind the register. It is some sort of tropical leaf, "healthy drink", per the cashier. I had it without sugar. Kind of non-descript, but refreshing and healthy. I will definitely try out their other sammiches and their hot food bar. I wish they had tables. I think there's one thing you should know about me and that's when I'm happy with something, then I usually stick with it. &#160;I'm a huge foodie, but luckily for me even the simplest and cheapest eats suit me just fine. &#160;Did I tell you the time one of my friends and I ate at Paseo every day for almost 2 months straight? &#160;So you're probably wondering.....where is all this going? &#160;Well, I happen to love Vietnamese sandwiches because 1) they're crazy delicious, 2) they're crazy cheap (like $2.25), and 3) they're fairly healthy sandwiches. &#160;At Seattle Deli I usually order the chicken sandwiches. &#160;In fact, I've ordered that sandwich every day after work for over a month so far (it's part of my new workout/diet routine). &#160;The cashier just looks and me when I walk in, I nod, he/she shouts out something in Vietnamese to the sandwich maker, and then it's on like Donkey Kong.The chicken is tasty and shredded and packed in a warm and semi-toasty baguette. &#160;Inside you'll find all the usual Vietnamese sandwich veggies like shredded carrots, daikon, cucumber, parsley, etc. &#160;It's great that they sell these for just a little over $2. &#160;Don't worry, this place definitely does make profit since they're almost always busy everytime I go. &#160;Today I managed to try this drink that caught my eye in the huge, glass refrigerated display case. &#160;It looked like it had little seeds in them with fungus or spores in it. &#160;Yeah, I wasn't sure if it was going to be good, but I had to try it to see. &#160;I asked the cashier and he said it's actually basil seeds and it's a sweet/dessert drink. &#160;I tried it over ice and it's pretty tasty. &#160;It kind of reminds me of a mix between the boba in bubble tea and kiwi. &#160;Anyway, I will most likely be there tomorrow after work again to get the tasty chicken sandwich and that weird moldy looking drink. &#160;Try it out! $2.50 for BBQ Pork Sandwich? No kidding~!! Sooo good &amp; i am so addicted.. :) If you want BBQ Pork Sandwich you need to pre-order them cuz they are so limited and gets pack in there... i love this place, the food is great, plus yummy frozen bubble drinks.I only wish I didn't have to park in the garbage-strewn strip of broken pavement every time I go there. &#160;How's about some new asphalt and a dumpster enclosure??
So I think I confused this particular place with the Saigon Deli. &#160;Not sure as I was searching for the wildly popular Vietnamese sandwich (all the rage). &#160;What we found was a crazy busy Vietnamese deli with a variety of patrons and a crazy variety of prepackaged curious delicacies (maybe?). &#160;there was also some sort of hot buffet with our curious items. &#160;Fortunately the sandwiches we ordered came from the back where they were being freshly made. &#160;They were quite tasty, very, very spicy and cheap, cheap, cheap. &#160;I could do without the food visuals in the deli though. &#160;Yikes. OMGWTFBBQ pork sandwichs for $2!!!IT'S OVER!!! Delightful BBQ Pork Sammich for a mere $2.25!!!!I really don't think you can beat this especially if you're on a budget and desperate for a savory treat. &#160;I can't believe that I haven't been here before, but thanks again to my trusty co-worker (B-squared), I have been shown the light.The rest of the store is intriguing if a little scary, but hey... &#160;sometimes those are the best, and if the pork sandwich (beware of the large slices of fresh jalapeno) is any indication, I AM IN!!! &#160;There's a bright bright yellow corn/rice puddingy type thing that is calling my name. &#160;It comes in a clear cup and appears to have coconut milk at the bottom and on top..hmmm, &#160;.50 cent egg rolls(not too shabby), and other mysterious looking items I'd be willing to try.All in all, I managed to fill my belly for a paltry $2.75 (was piggy and had egg roll too)!!!! &#160;Bargain? &#160;YES! &#160;A tasty bargain at that! &#160;:-)
Well, I went with BBQ pork in mind but didn't see it available in any dish except for fried rice, or in a la carte / by the pound. &#160;I didn't look that closely at the menu, so maybe I missed something. &#160;It was a to go order, and I asked if there were any dishes which would include BBQ pork and some greens, like Chinese broccoli.She was pretty terse but I'm used to language barriers, and I gave it the benefit of the doubt. &#160;Anyway, she pointed to a beef w/ Chinese broccoli dish in a satay sauce, or a pea vine w/ meat in a garlic sauce - she gave me the option to sub pork. &#160;I said the pea vine would be fine and, again, mentioned I wanted BBQ pork. &#160;Well, I get the food home (I live in the ID), and it's regular pork swimming in a very run-of-the-mill garlic sauce. &#160;The pea vines have been cooked to limpness and an off-green color, and the mushrooms came from a can or similar. &#160;I was hungry and didn't have food in the house, so I ate the pork, carrots and some of the pea vines. &#160;Oh, and at least half was pea vines.My stomach is feeling off, and I just read some of the other yelp reviews saying this place has been shut down several times for health code violations - nice. &#160;The dish ran me $15, without rice - seriously? &#160;With as much great food as is available in the ID, I can't understand why this place was crowded. &#160;I moved into the ID five months ago and want to try most or all places, but this will be the last time for 663. &#160;Not good.
I've eaten here a few times in the past and thought it was decent. &#160;I went last night, however, and our meal was really subpar so the place seems to have gone down hill.We had chow fun noodles and the "hollow vegetables with chili sauce". &#160;The chow fun was insanely greasy. &#160;After a few bites the oil and MSG created a nasty coating on my tongue that pretty much ruined my appetite. &#160;The vegetables were a bit better, although the inattentive waiter apparently had the cook make them with garlic sauce instead of the requested chili.The service was completely indifferent. &#160;I had to ask each time for them to take our order, provide to-go boxes and bring the check. &#160;I won't bother going back as there are definitely better options out there. What can I say, &#160;they serve affordable and good Chinese food. It's a great place to go when you've got the major late night munchies after partying late at night. Awesome Chinese food. The stuffed eggplant is very interesting. We also had some wonderful pork, chicken, and veg. Family friendly too. Better than all those places which appear appealing from the outside and then serve mediocre Chinese food on the inside. I come here often, I mean come on, I'm a chinese-american college student who really can't cook any type of chinese food whatsoever, what do you expect? &#160;This place is great, it's open late, has good food, and some what okay service. &#160;But you can't really expect great service from any place in chinatown unless your parents know the owners.My favorite is the salty-fish and chicken fried rice, it's really to die for, just the way I ate it growing up. &#160;It might sound not too tempting, but believe me, thinking about it just makes my mouth water. &#160;It has all the traditional cantonese style dishes and they are all cooked really well.The roast pork, duck and bbq pork here are also top quality (I know because my mom told me so) and many nights I am tempted to buy a pound of each and make rice to eat it by myself in my apartment (but I won't because roast pork isn't good as a left over).I also like that it's open late, so for those nights I get off work late... or the weekends I need a place to go to with friends, this is one of them.This is one of the better/ cleaner restaurants in chinatown, so I suggest you go here if you're craving some real chinese food :) This was a great place to get some good tasting cheap chinese after a hard day of moving furniture! Everything was great. Clean place. Good food. Service was sub par and could use a little more heat to warm up the place. Just sayin...they still have the best pea vines and I've been doing my research. If I was on the receiving end of the bad service that I was informed of by a coworker I probably would have given 663 Bistro a lower rating. That being said...I ordered the pan fried rice noodles with Brisket Curry. They actually packaged it up with the noodles separate from the curry which was nice because it didn't leak all over the bag. However, next time I will order this with rice as the noodles didn't seem to really match the curry. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the curry was really good! The brisket was tender but there were several chunks of fat that I would rather forget about as the texture was really gross in my mouth. I would definitely come back here and try some other dishes. Big thumbs up! OMY, you need to try their curry!!! &#160;Try it nyaow!Alright, so they have a vast menu and I have not gotten around to trying a little bit of everything, but I have tried their curry, and I cannot wait until the next time I can order it again!Okay, so their curry selection maybe takes up a fifth of a page. &#160;And unlike a Thai restaurant where each of the curry sauces taste and look very different depending on what you order, 663 Bistro looks like it actually uses the SAME curry sauce for each item on the menu, just with a different kind of meat. &#160;But man - I do not see a problem with this coz their curry sauce is oh so yummy!Rich, creamy, and a little sweet and full of that coconut milk flavor! &#160;And each order of curry is packed with so much meat that it should be enough for two people with appetites! &#160;I have tried the chicken curry and the beef brisket curry because people have been raving about it, but I think the chicken curry is the best. &#160;And it also looks like the chicken curry gets served a little faster than the beef brisket curry, but it's all good.One time we took home our curry leftovers and the half roast duck we never finished. &#160;I cannot remember if there was a duck curry on the menu, but what we did with the leftovers was heat up the leftover duck IN the curry sauce to make our own roast duck curry. &#160;Can anyone say HELL YEAH!?!? &#160;Delicious. I've been here a couple times. &#160;They don't have lunch specials. They only have family style dining. It's only good if you come with a group of people. Not so good if you're just on a lunch run. The interior is nothing fancy. The last time I came in they had boxes stacked up as if they were either moving in or moving out. The service isn't quick either. The only thing I like about this place is the pea vine, but I can get pea vine at a closer location to my work. One of my favorite places to eat in the ID. Whenever I'm craving Chinese, this is the place I go. Good prices, large dishes and it's always delicious. Horrible service. &#160;cheap food. &#160; All the makings of a real chinese restaurant. &#160; &#160;Food is fairly good for the most part but if you're all about service, avoid this place like the plague. &#160;(We got rushed out to make room for another party on multiple occasions.) Went back again with a party of five. We cleverly didn't order one dish per person this time, since the servings were so big. Minced pork and green beans was good. Roasted pork was pretty good, but the roasted duck was too full of awkward bone shards to be very fun to eat. Beef with lotus root in XO sauce was pretty good. Chicken wings pretty good, but I prefer them dry rather than sticky with sauce. Oh 663, been coming here for years but I've never written a review. What can I say, this place is great! Well lit, huge and generous portions, and clean for a restaurant in this neighborhood (clean meaning never seen a roach or other "tenant" and I can't say I've been in the restroom - should I be worried?). Like other reviewers have said the first few times I've eaten here I thought some of the staff were standoffish, but over time I've come to find that this is just the way they are.Bottom line: if you want 2-3 (level of hunger pending) meals for less than $10 come here, but don't expect the friendliest of service. Ever since the world famous V Garden restaurant closed due to a fire, some friends and I have endured endless early mornings after the club looking, stomachs rumbling, waiting for a match. These mornings were spent regaling the nights events as well as meeting some interesting, cool transients and drug dealers/addicts that frequent the ID.The emptiness in my gut began its journey back to full when a friend (the same one that recommended ABC Garden that then became V Garden) spoke of a Chinese joint that he described as the "Atlantis of Chinese restaurants". Although I already took his word for it 100, it wasn't until the Salt &amp; Pepper Chicken Wings that the lost feelings were rekindled, reminiscent of the V Garden days.We finally got a meet spot again!Crispy, tender with a touch of spice, this dish is the crown of the restaurant. Other favorites include Ong Choy and Pea Vines for veggies, Westlake Beef soup, and of course Chinese broccoli with beef. Those are my favorites but just about everything else is great if not good.The waitress that works after 1am is great! Jokes, great social conversation with patrons!Otherwise the service can be sometimes lackluster if you decide to come during the day.I'll just stick to eating there after midnight versus stopping by for lunch during work. Pea vines. &#160;Pea vines. &#160;Pea vines. &#160;It's good here. &#160;So yes, there's lots of oil. &#160;But there's so much garlicy goodness that you don't care.Most of their other dishes are also really good - fried noodles, hot pots, chicken wings. &#160;But if all I had to eat was rice and garlic pea vines, I'd still be happy. Salt and Pepper chicken wings, oh yeah. Oh Yeah oh yeah. Do it do it do it. Love the curry and the BBQ pork! &#160;The portions are large so when going with a group get one less dish and share them family style.
This is where I would go for bbq pork in Seattle. Good solid place, however, in their infinite wisdom they hired this really awful waitress from Purple Dot. I will NEVER be rid of her. She is so bad at her job. I'm Chinese but don't have family here, so when I moved here I just couldn't find a Chinese restaurant I wanted to go back to. There is the super authentic ones then there's Americanized Chinese food. This one is leaning towards the authentic side, but with good prices and a huge menu. I love the salted pepper chicken wings (appetizer) the most. I'm planning to go back and eat mostly everything on the menu at some point! First and probably last visit. Ordered "curry beef brisket:. What meat there was wasn't brisket. I know my meats and am pegging this at cheap pot roast. However, that wasn't my main grip. Main gripe was that the overwhelming majority of this "meat" was really giant chunks of fat. I figure on the order of 5 chunks of fat to each chunk of real(?) meat. I'm not talking about chunks of meat with a lot of fat - I'm talking about chunks of fat, period. One was the size of both of my thumbs. Absolutely disgusting! The only good news was that the curry sauce was tasty. The reason I go here is because it is CHEAP. &#160;My fiance and I get full off their wonton noodle soup and soy sauce chicken over rice for about $12...this includes tax, tip, ya da ya da.The food can sometimes be a hit or miss...for example: &#160;the roast pork - HIT...the clay pot - MISS. &#160;But for the price, we've found some staples that are cheap and always a hit (any of their bbq pork, soy sauce chicken, or roast pork over rice).There are tastier places to go to in the ID, but there are also not-so-tasty places in the ID...this restaurant leans towards the tasty side! A few of my girl-friends and I went there for congee early this morning. We went in right as they opened. I had the fish congee and it was delicious and the constituency of the congee was very good. I will definitely be visiting this place again in the next week or two. One note though, they only accept cash.Update: Their Chinese donuts are awesome for making sticky rice! This place has never done me wrong. &#160;If you want cheap, good, big portions of Chinese food, then come here. &#160;I always get the beef brisket soup noodle, baked pork chop rice, and some hot pot dish. &#160;Recently, I tried the cod with eggplant and fried tofu hotpot and it was good. &#160;As of yet, I've never had a bad experience. &#160;However my cousin who ate here said not to get the fried squid because he got food poisoning from it. Just a heads up....ps. &#160;bring cash, they don't take credit or checks... My place of choice for quick Chinese snacks...I ordered their congee with liver, thousand year old egg, and/or fish. The congee style is by cooking the rice for really long time and basically disappears. &#160;(not good as leftovers) &#160;My friends order their wonton noodle soup and complain that the broth was too salty (overload with MSG). Their BBQ is not bad (so I was told). &#160;Some Chinese restaurants buys the BBQ from this place and reheats and sell at their place. (yumm?) &#160;There's one tofu dish that I love and I forgot the name of the dish (I'll update that later). &#160;The tofu is Japanese style which is round and soft, topped with enokitake mushrooms, and sliced green beans and bell peppers for color. &#160;I've been to other restaurants but no other place makes it better then here. Once again.. If you forget that you're in the international district.. bring CASH! Really Really Really Good Chinese FoodI get the sneaking suspicion that they don't want me there, but I don't care what they think about the skin color or &#160;language barriers I possess. &#160;They offer great Chinese food. &#160;So good In fact I think it's really great. &#160;I find it really hard to find really great Chinese food in Seattle, Really! &#160;Especially since my favorite place closed over a year ago. &#160;Ahhh, but now I have found 663 Bistro. &#160;The restaurant is simple, with a lot of tables and is usually crowded but not entirely full of people. I've decided that the Salt and Pepper chicken wings are my favorite, crispy and spicy....yum, yum. &#160;I also tried a spicy beef short rib and pepper dish that was soo good, I ate the entire thing all by myself. &#160;While you may feel a little out of place if you are of the White persuasion you should definitely put that aside and try the awesome food they have to offer here. I was hoping for some really authentic, really good Chinese food, but something here seemed amiss. &#160;The food was good, but not great - and I feel like they could have used fresher ingredients.The big minus for me was that there is no alcohol. &#160;Next time I'm in the area, you can bet I'll head for one of the restaurants with a "Budweiser" or a "Cocktails" neon sign in the window. My friend and I got congee there. &#160;She got the pork with preserved egg and I got the fish with pig intestine (preserved egg added ... since it's yummylicious =d). &#160;It was pretty tasty. &#160;My only real complaint was the fact that it wasn't as thick as I usually take my congee =d &#160;I like it oatmeal thick XD &#160;Well, just a little runnier ;P &#160;I walked past a table that had the roasted pork, oh man did that look A-MA-ZING! &#160;I almost backed into my friend to go, "Um...hey! &#160;Can I have a pound or two of that?" but then I remembered I wasn't hungry and that there was sashimi in the car =dSo we drove around for 1hr+ before we got home and I was like, awwww we'll probably have to microwave the congee =T &#160;But it was still piping hot! &#160;On a freakin' rainy day too!!! &#160;Impressive *nods*ps...I must try their roasted pork if I come back to Seattle =) &#160;Also, it was funny hearing the girl and guy working there playfully bicker at each other while waiting for my food XD Gosh I love this place!!!!!3 stars for cleanness, and the fried riceThe fried rice with the curry, you can't go wrong if you love rice as much as meIt's a twist to fried rice, they put curry and vegetables and meat on top of rice, and your suppose to mix it, it's the best thing!!!!The view from the window isn't all that well, but it's a nice look at nightlife in Seattle.
A brand new Chinese restaurant in the ID is no news. But this one might be sumthin to chat about. Very clean and very friendly. We had the tomato and beef noodle dish with the crispy noodles as they are not as heavy as the buckwheat-type noodle; honey garlic spare ribs; and deep fried pepper salted squid = All rocked! The portions are huge and the prices are amazingly low for the quality and quantity you get. 3 of use went and the leftovers we brought back to work were consumed by 2 more people. I told my friends that I would review this place on Yelp, and they were like NO! We want it to be our lil secret. But I couldn't do that to my fellow Yelpers.:o)
I didn't love my entree (the tomato sauce was a bit on the sour side) but I loved everything else. We had been trying to go here for months but it always had a 30-minute wait, but Sunday night we finally got 4 people in without trouble. I suppose that's the secret.Cheese plate (I can't resist a good cheese plate), great wine, tasty cocktails and amazing dessert. And the wild boar will have to be my entree next time, if only for the cream sauce. I previously raved to my friends about Volterra, but my opinion has changed just a bit. We took my mom here for Brunch and were really disappointed.I ordered the Wild Mushrooms Eggs Benedict with truffle scented Hollandaise, a dish I have ordered a few times before and was looking forward to having again.What arrived was some oil/egg massacre that any decent chef would have never let leave the kitchen. I thought of Gordon Ramsay knocking the plate out of the would-be chef's hand telling them to start over.They were obviously at the bottom of the vat of the prepared mushrooms and had decided to fry them to bring them back to life. This scanty array of very oily and over cooked mushrooms sat pathetically atop the English muffins. I could have dealt with it if it was just the mushrooms, but the state of the eggs made me send it back --- they were hard boiled. They were clearly cooked for too long and the whites vaporized, leaving miniscule amounts of twisted egg white around a hard boiled egg yoke. It looked like shit on the plate, and that alone should have inspired someone (the chef preferably but if not, then the server) to have it re-made. (In case you haven't ever had Eggs Benedict the eggs are very specifically poached so that the yoke has a smooth and fluid texture).When it arrived I said to the waitress, "This doesn't look good, the eggs are really over cooked." She ignored me, asked if any one else needed anything and walked away. I tried to get her attention twice (we were one of only two tables, I was surprised she could miss my eye so often) and finally had to call her over.I requested that they remake it and the second go round was okay, but not the masterpeice they should have sent out to make up for the crap they sent our before. I was really disappointed in the chef and our server who clearly knew that it was wrong and simply did not want to deal with it.I think if I had been at a diner I might have not been so ready to furrow my brow but Volterra bills itself as an upscale place, and refers to good ol' eggs benedict as "Wild Mushrooms with Truffle Scented Hollandaise". I would expect them to live up to the standard that they set. I may go back to Volterra but I was pretty put off.I gave it 3 stars here as I used to love this place. Ah...the food of my people. Being half-Italian, I like to reconnect with my roots whenever I can. I say that half-joking because I was born in the US, right here in Seattle, and have to search back three generations to get to my Italian-born ancestors. Nevertheless, I'm always seeking out authentic dishes. It's good to dishes of my homeland. Ha!Last April, my wife and I chose Italy for our belated honeymoon. It was a 2-week trip, starting in Venice, with several stops in Tuscany, a 2-day respite in the Cinque Terre, and ending with a few days in Rome.We picked up a car in La Spezia for the Tuscany part, and on the day we journeyed to San Gimignano, we stopped off for a while in the hill town of Volterra. Our 3-hour stop there was quite enjoyable. There were lots of great shops and eating opportunities, but as with all Tuscan hill towns, the best part about it was the history, the architecture, the vistas, and the general "feel" of the place. Alas, our trip to Volterra was marred slightly by the presence of a parking violation on our windshield when we departed. We had parked along the side of the road, along with several other cars, thinking "when in Italy, do as Italians do". Not so, that day. All of the other cars had parking tickets too.Okay, this isn't supposed to be a travelogue, so I'll wrap that part up by saying that we had a great time in Tuscany, and several great meals. So, when I discovered on Yelp that there was a great restaurant in Ballard, named for Volterra and featuring great Tuscan cuisine, I just had to give it a try. My wife and I met up with two friends there last Friday for an early dinner. To kick things off, I ordered the Volterra Sky cocktail, the house drink incorporating sage, vodka, citrus, and blue curaco. It was fab, and not too sweet. I also enjoyed the variety of homemade breads, making a dip from olive oil and salt and herbs from the Deruta-esque server on the table. Delicious! I asked the waitress' recommendation for an entre and ordered the wild boar. My wife and I also ordered the apple and goat cheese salad. I asked for a wine recommendation and was suggested a glass of Super Tuscan. I forgot to note the label, but it was a full-bodied red which paired nicely with the boar.Everything was excellent! It really did remind me of some of the meals we had in Tuscany. The last time I had wild boar was in the restaurant of La Cisterna in San Gimignano (Tuscany) (pic http://steampark.com/ita&#8230; ). This was just as good as I remember it being then, if not a touch better. We finished off our meal with espresso and a slice of the chocolate-orange cake.I highly recommend Volterra and will definitely be going back. Rating: 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5. Ciao! At 6am I woke up in Ballard in an apartment I'd never been to and could barely remember how I got to. I was in good spirits and HUNGRY, so I offered to buy my friends breakfast for taking good care of me the previous night. I know everyone thinks of this place for romantic dinners, but try brunch!We had wild mushroom benedict (YUUUUUM), bowtie pasta with smoked chicken artichokes, cheese, red sauces, and asparagus, eggs with yummy stuff in them, sparkling white wine, and two plates of bacon. There wasn't a single thing on the menu I wouldn't have liked.Can't say enough good things about the food, but the clencher for me is the Coffee: Cafe Umbria done right. It was rich and smooth, just like me... well the smooth part anyway. Walking or driving the one-way streets in the heart of Ballard, it's easy to miss Volterra. This small restaurant seems hidden among the angle-parked cars and the Ballard "scene." Yet once inside, the atmosphere is warm with contemporary design. We began with a wine recommendation from the sommelier - Broglia Gavi di Gavi "La Meirana" 2004. Then it was onto the menu, which focuses on Tuscan cuisine. I chose the "house made pasta tossed with locally harvested wild mushrooms, fava beans, truffle butter and parmigiano reggiano." For dessert, I wanted something light. Fresh berries with creme anglaise was the perfect choice.Did I mentioned we ordered a second bottle of the wine? Yes, I left the restaurant a bit more than tipsy. Next time I'd like to try their "Ultimate White Peach Thyme Bellini" cocktail.I highly recommend Volterra for special occasions or when you are craving high-quality Italian food. Volterra's menu is excellent, but that is not why I'm giving 5 stars. &#160;They get the best review because of their service. &#160;They were more than willing to accomodate my wife's wheat &amp; dairy allergies by modifying and customizing our order... so far above and beyond just removing something like most places will. &#160;Our waiter summed it up perfectly: "You are paying a lot to eat here, you should get what you are paying for". &#160;Not only were they happy to make a few changes to accomodate, but were pleased that the food still met high expectations. &#160;Stand out menu items: start out with the Oil Soup, it's sooo tasty. &#160;Wild Boar is not something you'll find everywhere, so enjoy it while you can. nothing short of scrumptious. &#160;Caesar was great, steak was fabulous. I had to fold up a paper napkin and use it as a shim to balance our wobbly table. &#160;works every time. The tiramisu was delightful and disappeared. I think my girlfriend likes tiramisu more than she likes me.
This is an old school retro fast food Burger joint. They were known for milk shakes and malt. &#160;I wanted an old school icecream shake malt since I was in the area so I stop by.I notice they also serve fried chicken, ribs, pot roast and entrees at this fast food joint? I don't know if I want a pot roast dinner when so many restaurant near by here. The staff could be older than my father in law...what happen to the teenagers?I got the oreo shake malt and tom n jerry for my daughter. &#160;It was pretty good but I had better. The Tom N Jerry taste just like egg nog but my daughter didn't like it so she took my Oreo Shake Malt.The Tom N Jerry was okay but I guess the Oreo Shake Malt was good because my daughter never gave it back to me. Sad Face.Anyways, this place is A-Ok. &#160;Do stop by to get a burger or shake! My first Burgermaster experience was less than thrilling. &#160;The decor and ambience was sub par, even for an old building. &#160;I certainly wasn't expecting anything fancy or gourmet, but the location didn't offer anything to add to the food experience.The burger I ate was good. &#160;While the fries were cooked well, they had very little flavor. &#160;Despite a good selection of menu items, the food was more expensive than it should have been relative to quality.This place was OK, but I will find another place the next time I want a burger. I could write poetry about good burger, but this place doesnt deserve it. It's like that boy/girlfriend you stay with because they put out (put out burgers in this case) but it's become a little tired and boring and they never laugh at your jokes anyway. Greasy burger with low-quality ingredients. CHEAP, quick, and easy (that's what she said) which is why we keep coming back. However, it's no Counter or Lunchbox Lab. The only reason I come here over Dicks is because there's indoor seating (Queen Anne isnt handy to me) and the combos at Burgermaster keep me from over-ordering/ wanting to die. I'm not breaking up with you Burgermaster, but I'm definitely requesting an open relationship. First off, the place look sketchy, im surprised jay and silent bob weren't hanging around outside trying to sell me some weed or something. You walk in the door and see huge menu over a long counter with nobody at it. Then you notice the condiment bar right in front of you. Im already unamused, then the order taker is extremely obnoxious and too freaking talkative. I just want some BBQ, is that so much to ask? So i finally sit down and it takes literally 5 minutes for them to bring my food out. Which is obviously a bad sign when you just ordered BBQ ribs. The ribs were HORRIBLE, rubbery and mostly bone and fat. The fries undercooked and too salty, not to mention the coleslaw was bland, and tasted like someone picked it up from KFC hours ago. I would never ever consider going back to that awful place again. Hands down the worst food ive had in the entirety of my life. My husband likes to come here for breakfast. &#160;It is a good, honest, no frills, bacon, eggs &amp; hashbrowns kind of breakfast. &#160;I'm kind of picky about how my eggs are cooked and I really don't like them to be browned at all, but they can't be slimy either. &#160;The first time we went here I ordered the Mexican omlette and it was mostly good except for a little bit of browning around the edges. &#160;The inside was tasty with taco meat, melted cheese, avocado, and sour cream. &#160;The hash browns were OK. &#160;I mean, I can't complain (unless I could ask that they be a little more crispy). &#160;But the best thing about the breakfast here is you can order a Burgermaster burger, fries, and milkshake if you want! &#160;Burgermaster burgers and strawberry shakes were special treats for me when I was growing up (my family was really Dick's people--back when the hamburgers were really 19 cents) so &#160;you can imagine what a treat it was to go to Burgermaster. &#160;A note about the strawberry shakes...they're pretty good. &#160;I mean, they're not the best strawberry shakes in the world (you need fresh strawberries for that) but they use a combination of icky strawberry syrup and frozen strawberries, so they're really second rate which is just about as much as you could hope for at a drive-in, isn't it? The burgers are good. &#160;I'm comparing apples to apples, Burgermaster burgers and shakes with other "drive-ins" and they are definitely a four star place. &#160;Breakfast (if you could only order breakfast stuff would be two or three stars--think Denny's). So when my husband wants to go to Burgermaster for breakfast, I just order the combo #1 and we're all happy. When you need to go back to the '70s for that perfect grilled cheese and root beer milk shake fix Burgermaster is the place to go. &#160;Even the fry container is straight of '76. &#160;There is seriously no place else that makes a grilled cheese like they do. &#160;I've heard that the pie isn't too shabby either. &#160;All I know is for an after Husky game feast- Burgermaster is the place. I'll never go to this place for meals again mainly because the people over there are not friendly, especially a bald guy who has strong and terrible accent. This guy's teasing, which was not good-natured, got my going. OMG, why did this store hire this lousy guy??????????The location for this restaurant is as follows:3040 NE 45th Street Seattle, WA 98105 (206) 525-7100
I've been here a few times over the years and recently my autistic brother asked me to take him here. &#160;I am almost at a loss for words to explain our experience, so I'll attempt to transcribe the conversation that transpired.Server: Welcome to Burgermaster, what can I get you?Brother: I'd like a burgermaster with bacon.Server: Sorry, we're out of meat.Brother: Are you joking?Server: No, sorry.Brother: What? &#160;Are you joking?Server: No, someone is out getting more meat right now.Me: Do you know how long a wait it will be?Server: I don't know. &#160;Hey [manager], do we know how long it will be?Manager: (exasperated) She'll get here when she gets here. &#160;She can't fly!Me: I guess we'll be going somewhere else. &#160;Thanks.Seriously people. &#160;You serve burgers. &#160;Keep your fridge stocked. &#160;Fortunately for my hungry brother and I Kidd Valley is nearby. Still feels like Montana, although I think I mean that in a good way now. Their booths are not as soft as you'd expect so please don't plop down because you may experience some shock from the hardness that lies beneath the vinyl upholstery.Ordered a vanilla milkshake which was faaaaaaantastic and refreshing and everything I had been craving when my friends and I decided to give Burgermaster a shot. My friend got the Tom &amp; Jerry because we were curious as to what was actually in it (guesses included jam, black-and-white although I'm not sure where THAT came from since they're grey and brown, and peanut-butter-and-jelly) and we quickly learned that IT'S EGGNOG! I won't lie, I was a little jealous. After wiki-ing why in the WORLD Tom &amp; Jerry would ever be used to describe an eggnog flavoured beverage, we learned that it has nothing to do with the cat and mouse that we know and love, but it's actually a seasonal drink with eggnog, brandy, and rum named after a play written in the 80s. I guess you DON'T stop learning after college!Their fries (yes, I actually got them this time) remind me of McDonalds (which is a good thing because the only reason to ever step foot into a McDonalds is for fries), but somewhat healthier, AKA not completely fried through all the way and not overly salted. They come in a little cup and there are no grease spots on the sides once you've finished to indicate your increased risk of atherosclerosis. Double win!I'll be back for my OWN Tom &amp; Jerry milkshake and maybe to try real food next time :) This place is great for breakfast and comfort foods. I come here when i need something the ave on university way doesnt satisfy my tastebuds. its a great place. I always get the beef dip or the crepes for breakfast. Both are my faves. its kinda like a sharis or denny's with better quality food. On my way home after 3-hour long class, I stepped in BurgerMaster, which is right on the busline on 45th and Union Bay by U-village. (location and convenience are very important to me)It's a good size family friendly restaurant. They not only server burgers, but also other food from pot roast, fish &amp; chips to breakfast. The restaurant is very clean and neat. The staff really did a good job keep it well-maintained. I enjoyed the burger. However, the bread was very soggy and greasy! I didn't want to assume, but I felt like the mushrooms were from a can. I wish I would have customized my burger a little more (I should have mentioned that I didn't want mustard on my burger. I like mustard, but it wasn't a good combination with cheese, mushroom, and greasy fatty burger to me) This joint definitely conveys a small town feel in a rather urban area. &#160;It successfully masks fast food into a small town diner feel. &#160;They claim that it's not fast food since it's not precooked, but the food comes out in a couple of minutes, so that's fast food in my book. &#160;The french fries were a bit oversalted, but the burgers were OK for the price. &#160;It has a full salad bar, and quite a variety of items to choose from on their menu. &#160;It's definitely a decent cheap eat if you're in U. Village. Very disappointed:( &#160;Burgermaster what happened, &#160;we have shared so many good calories together. &#160;Ate her today and was sad to say your grilled cheese was sooooo oily, &#160;I coud barely put her down. &#160;My son got the kid chx strips for $7.50?? &#160;Why? &#160;There was 2 chx strips and about 10 fries. &#160;BooHoo BM I used to love hearing from you. &#160;Granted it has been years since we have spoken, &#160;so who knows when you lost your spark. &#160;Just need to mention that the staff freaked out on me because I wanted ketchup and ranch. &#160;Hello people we are dealing with fries and chx!!! &#160;It was a 5 minute conversation between staff members. &#160;Lame. &#160;I know economy is tough, &#160;but geez:( &#160;Saddened &#160;as I remember you used to be able to help yourself to condiments to go and now you have to go through a long and agonizing process. Burgers as tasty as In-N-Out, for only twice the price. Breakfast from a burger place? Unheard of, right? Well, in my last review of Charlies Diner, I said that it was a good old-fashioned roadside diner. Well, this "drive-in" might just challenge it. If stories are really your thing, then I'll tell it. We just got back from ESPN's College GameDay at the Hec-Ed, and the early wake-up call matted out any chances of the usual Chocolate Chex. So we went to the place where people usually pig out late-night on double-cheeseburgers. It was a whole different scene. Old people sat, reading the newspaper, and the menu was expansive. The Burgermaster I usually go to in Bellevue is a Drive-In only, but this place is an actual restaurant. I got the number two, which is eggs (i got mine over easy), hashbrowns and toast.Everything was great, and I must add, the burgers are amazing for dinner and lunch as well. Service was friendly, and it was a nice place to eat breakfast.
Location, location, location.This Burgermaster taunts my boyfriend and me every time he picks me up from work: it's the perfect "backroads on the way home pick up some dinner" place.I'll admit that I don't like burgers all that much, but man, when I'm in the mood for a cheesy, beefy grease-bomb, Burgermaster does it right. &#160;And when I'm not? &#160;Chicken! &#160;Salad bar! &#160;Milkshakes! &#160;The choices are endless.Beware of the afternoon rush, though, and the traffic crossing 45th. &#160;Once you're past that, though, enjoy your milkshake and, if you're feeling fun, try the pot roast. Even from the first time I tried Burgermaster way back in high school, I couldn't understand why this place was so loved. To this day I see it get mentioned as being among the best burger places in the Seattle area, but it has always been boring and bland. I've held this opinion long before all the trendy gourmet burger places popped up, back when the only other options were Dick's Burgers and Kidd Valley, both of which have always been better imho. Getting in/of this location is a serious cluster---- too.
Expensive? &#160;What are you people talking about? &#160;Evidently you don't eat breakfast out in the greater Seattle area too often. &#160;This place is a bargain! &#160;The food is standard homestyle fare, yes, but hey, it's quality, and a lot of people like and want that and Patty's fits the bill. &#160;The menu has a great selection, the portion sizes are generous compared to the prices (check out the Club Sandwich) and the food is always cooked well and tastes great. &#160;The service is attentive (albeit a tad impersonal and hurried at times) and the food arrives quickly. &#160;Patty's is my go-to place when I want a great breakfast/lunch at a reasonable price. &#160;There's absolutely nothing wrong with good, predictable, satisfying food. &#160;Not every breakfast place in Seattle has to be a Coastal Kitchen, 5 Spot, or Crave-style place that is more about being trendy than serving quality, reasonably-priced food. &#160;And, to top it off, Patty's has plenty of FREE parking, which, in my book, is a major plus. &#160;I wholeheartedly recommend you check out Patty's Egg Nest! well... besides the leaking ceiling which was actually kind of amusing as i was about to blame my infant son for another one of his random oozings but then i was like...wait it's the ceiling!! &#160;it was yummy... i had the Swedish pancakes with eggs and bacon which were tasty and very good for a calm breakfast...not too overwhelming... and i tasted the nutter butter french toast which was totally sickening in the oh my god i am going to have a heart attack after eating this way... it was tasty and waaay too much peanut butter and sweetness... definitely good for a taste but i personally can't handle it as a meal early on a Sunday morning... i would go back and i will try the other locations... overall i was very happy!! &#160;but why is it called eggnest?? isn't that sort of redundant? like isn't that what nests are for.... i guess patty's nest isn't as telling of it's it breakfast-y potential?? ::shrug::: Update for 2011: Last couple times have been a little hit or miss. One time I felt I was being rushed out the door. &#160;And then last time they weren't taking credit cards! I hope the credit card issue gets fixed soon. If it's not fixed, that's a dealbreaker for me. I hardly ever carry cash. Still a quality establishment, I hope that my recent experiences are just a one-off. Definately worth the wait. &#160;This is a great breakfast place!! and Friday/Saturday night dinner isn't so bad either. &#160;The food is all homemade comfort food. &#160;And enough to share. &#160;The waitstaff is friendly and not afraid to help and make sure you have coffee, etc. &#160;Prices are perfect and everything is made to perfection. &#160;Try the other Patty's, too. &#160;They are all great!!
This might be the best "taco" truck on the planet. Hidden between a smoke shop and The Home Depot, this semi permanent, stylish and clean cafe on wheels. The mole is great and the pulled pork burrito is outstanding. when the chicken tamales are on the menu, take out a second mortgage and buy them all!! Prices are &#160;fair, portions plentiful, service friendly and its VERY busy! The service here is sloooow. &#160;And judging from the rest of the reviews, it wasn't just me. &#160;It loses another star for the nasty nasty smell of garbage coming from the dumpster. &#160;I couldn't finish my food while there it got so bad. &#160;I don' t know if this is their fault but it's still gross. We ordered three carne asada tacos which were pretty tasty ans well as a chicken quesadilla and a chicken mulita. &#160;While the food was good, it wasn't spectacular. I probably wouldn't go there if I wasn't already in the neighborhood. &#160;We waited about 20 minutes for our food, with only 2 orders ahead of us. &#160;After eating at Rancho Brava so much where the service is super quick, this seemed like a long time.The outdoor seating is nice (sans the garbage smell) &#160;and the salsa bar is awesome. **In my head** Why would I drive farther for mexi- truck food? Rancho Bravo is literally 5 minutes away, but yet I drove the extra 15 min in search of this place. Should I really believe the hype about this place? They did have a pretty long line at the Mobile Chowdown... ugh, how could I even consider cheating on rancho bravo??Then all of a sudden I heard it.Like spanish sirens calling out to sailors, I heard spanish music as I rolled through the Home Depot parking lot this truck was located in. I had arrived, and just in time for lunch, my stomach told me.**end dream sequence**Kinda went all out, ordered the plato mexicano, pork mulita, and a fish taco (not all for myself). The mulita was pretty darn good, as was the fish taco. (wasn't fried fish!) However, the plato mexicano was a bit of a disappointment. Maybe it's just me, but I'm just not a fan of large pieces of overcooked flank steak. I mean, we're talking about a good sized piece of meat, and I'm supposed to cut this thing w/ this measly plastic knife? I'd avoid this one, unless you happen to really like flank, and carry a steak knife with you.Good enough to come back? Yes! Sorry, but just had to dock a star off for the plato mexicano =/ But I'd recommend the other stuff. I guess it's ok to cheat on your fav restaurant sometimes. There just might be something new worth going for. Taco trucks always make me a little nervous. Me and my stomach sensitivity think of them as frenemies. So last saturday I thought why not, lets try this place that we are been eyeing for the past year. El camion was the nicest taco truck I have ever visited. They have a brand spankin new shiny sign and a gorgeous truck. They even had a few brand new vans parked next to the truck which looked like catering trucks. Seems they do pretty well up there on aurora. Not surprised because most of their clientele are big hungry men coming across the parking lot from home depot.We got almost everything on the menu and shared it. We ordered fish tacos, carne asada tacos, pork tacos, chicken burrito, chicken gorditas and some other dish with chicken and avocado sandwiches in between to tortillas. Everything was amazingly awesome. The only thing that wasn't up to par with the rest of the food were the chips which were cold and stale. Also, the girl taking our orders seemed to want to shoot herself every time we asked her a question. Not the best service but whatever, it was damn good mexican food. All right- skip this joint if you're in a hurry- you're not picking up a quick bite to eat from this mexican food stand...which is weird because aren't those stands usually throwing food out the window at warp speed?I'm not a huge mexican food fan, I usually like the idea of eating mexican more than I actually enjoy eating it- but on the way back from little league (they won 14-3, thanks for asking...) we stopped in here for lunch.Pretty routine service, nothing special- language barrier, kind of curt, no big deal.If you get there when there's no tables your going to be a little screwed...unless you're getting it to go.And like I mentioned, be prepared to wait.And wait.And wait.But it's way worth it- I got the steak burrito and it was insanely good...I actually can't wait till I'm hungover next time to go get one of these. I know it's going to be perfect.The Girl got the grilled chicken gorditas which were also really good.The Boy got the pork tamales...but I hate tamales so I didn't try that- he didn't like them either, but I would have been worried if he did because tamales are kind of gross...Don't sweat that it's a few feet from Auroura and in a Home Depot parking lot- it's a good time. I went here yesterday and ordered two chicken tacos and one chicken verde tamale. The chicken tacos were delicious, but the tamale was scary. It was wrapped in a banana leaf, for starters, and then once unwrapped, it was a half-cold mushy corn mess with chunks of grey, smelly chicken in it. They were also sold out of horchata for the day, so I got a Mexican coke.El Camion taught me a valuable lesson, and that is that the most important rule of going to a taco truck is to only trust the tacos. Somehow I always leave Home Depot starving. &#160;And the idea of eating a hot dog from HD's HD stand just doesn't sound very good. &#160;Enter El Camion to fill the void. &#160;Their tacos were really good, I got 2 pork and 2 chicken, and my friend got a burrito that looked like at least 2 meals worth. &#160;They have these nom-nommy pickled veggies out by the 5 or so salsa selections and I grabbed a big scoop of those to add to the meal. &#160;Pineapple Jarritos to wash it all down.The time I went here, they were pulled over to the side of the parking lot in a little tree-shaded area and had a few tables and chairs out along side the trailer. &#160;That was a nice option. &#160;Their service was friendly and pretty quick, but then there was only 1 person ordering in front of us so not a big line-up or anything. I've been reminiscing on my time in Mexico from last March and decided it was time to fix that craving. Well, at least my food craving. This place conveniently takes Visa and MasterCard so that was a plus! I decided on two adobada tacos and a fish taco, and the hubby had a carnita torta. Mmmm, everything was seasoned well and the garnishments were perfect. I liked my fish taco just slightly better than the adobada ones, but both were overall delicious. My husband wish he had ordered another torta... I'm sure he'll be asking if we can go again tonight. This will be a great place for us to frequent in the summer as they have some outdoor seating and umbrellas! MMMmmmmmulitas of pure and utter tasty superiority to all other mulitas I have eaten! I love mexican food and have eaten at many a taquiera all over the place and I have to say that these mulitas are the best. Red pork, cheese, cilantro, green salsa, red onions and orn tortillas overall tasty. A little too much cheese but seriously can you ever really have tooo much cheese? The line was long at mobile chowdown but totally worth it and oh by the way they had mexican coca cola... oooooo yummy I love that stuff! Overall it was a pretty awesome little place and I'll definitely hit them again if I head down towards the area. This is a quality taco truck, perched on the edge of Home Depot's parking lot is a local gem. &#160;Complete with table and chair sets for outdoor dining, music piped in through speakers, and more salsa options than you can believe, this is not your average taco truck.The breakfast burrito is bomb! &#160;Full of grilled vegetables (onions, red and green peppers), the right amount of egg, beans, rice, and all the fixings, this is my new go-to place for a breakfast burrito. &#160;My mom sampled the fish tacos which were no fish nuggets - this was quality white fish (halibut I think) flaky and moist, topped with salsa, guacamole, and the perfect amount of spice.The best part - the price is right, and the wait is minimal. &#160;I'll be back soon, and next time I'm trying to "mulita," that looked good! One night over the holidays, when a friend and I were getting ready to walk inside a huge building for an industry party, we saw the El Camion truck parked outside. &#160;Forget the fact that we were supposed to look cute and care at least a little bit about our appearance. &#160;We were hungry, and there was a taco truck. &#160;8 tacos later, we felt that we had built up the courage (and satiated our appetite enough) to walk inside and party a bit. &#160;After a *very* short time, we retired for the night, realizing that our new outfits had been put to great use, and we were full.There is definite taco quality to be found here. &#160;AND they pile on the cilantro. This spot has good solid tacos... but sadly it just isn't my style. The truck itself looks pretty cool, solid black with red lettering. The menu was pretty diverse as was the taco meat selection. We ordered asada, cochinita pibil and carnitas tacos. It took rather long for them to come out considering we were the only ones in line at the time. The good thing is that they don't skimp on the meat and they give you plenty of limes on the side. The tacos were so full of meat that I could barely fold the darn things! The sad part was that the asada was a tad dry. One thing I discovered that I don't particularly like is that they automatically top the tacos with onions, cilantro AND tomatoes. Call me a traditionalist, but I like mine with the normal cilantro and onions. If you're a tomato-on-everything kind of person then this place is perfect for you. But as for me... the hunt for the best taco truck continues... Why so slow? &#160;I still give you a five-star rating, but it kills me. &#160;It's literally 20 minutes to get food. &#160;I've been here a lot of times, and I wait just long enough to not want to come back again for a month.Now, on to the food. &#160;Glorious. &#160;The quality of meat, the flavor, seasonings, varieties of salsa--they're all very good. &#160;This is the best taco cart I've been to in the NW, and I was really missing San Diego until I stopped here. &#160;I'm hard on taco carts, and this food is amazing. &#160;Very clean site, nice sitting area (for a taco cart), worth the wait. &#160;We're just not used to this kind of wait at a roach coach. Awesome Mexican food. This is beyond a typical Taco Truck. In the parking lot of Home Depot (target audience?)? Their food is killer here. Had Pozole, a pork Torta, and some fish and pork tacos. Everything was fresh and tasty. Service was quick. Servings were large. I will be back for sure. Big fan. We've heard good things about this place, and were going to Home Depot to look at artificial Xmas trees anyway, so it seemed like the perfect Friday night dinner solution.We shared one fish taco, one chicken mulita, and one mole platter.Fish taco was really good. Shoulda gotten two.Mulita thing was fine, but I'd definitely choose to try other items instead next time and probably always. I dunno, maybe I'll try again another time, as it was okay, just not amazing.The mole platter was great. Plenty of super tender chicken slathered in some really delicious, spicy, chocolatey mole. Comes with rice which is a little different tasting, in a good way. Can't really explain what the different flavor was, but I really enjoyed it. Garnished with avocados FTW. Corn tortillas to stuff with mole, and the whole thing was delicious. The perfect amount of food to share, about $20 w/tip. Taco truck at Home Depot? The owner could be a certifiable genius! We had chips and salsa, and the carnitas tacos and fish tacos. The food is fresh and flavorful. There's always a line, so come early or come willing to wait! I love this place. &#160;Their tamales are SO good - especially the Chicken Mole. &#160;Every time I go here, my eyes are bigger than my stomach because you can get so much food for so little $$.I have had both very fast, and pretty slow service here. &#160;Either way, it's worth the wait. &#160;And I have never eaten it there so I can't speak to the garbage smell, but waiting for my food I have never noticed it. Three words: &#160;Mexican food orgasm. The food at El Camion is extremely authentic - hands down the best taco truck I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. &#160;Coming from Eastern Washington where a taco truck is parked in every 5 mile radius, I should know. The Mole Plate was rich and delicious, but more on the sweet than the savory side. &#160;The fish tacos are fresh and at $2 a taco, they'll fill you up and not break the bank. &#160;Plus, all of the tortillas were hand-made with corn ground so fine, it was hard to tell if they were flour, corn, or simply something sent from the taco gods. &#160;The carne asada burrito was enormous and mouth-watering with perfectly seasoned and marinated steak - very juicy with a fantastic smoke flavor. &#160;At $7 a burrito it can definitely last most people two meals. &#160; Lastly, one of my favorite (not to mention hard to find) side dishes: &#160;Jalape&#241;o Escabeche. &#160;El Camion makes their own spicy pickled carrot, white onion and jalape&#241;o - not that straight out-of-the-can stuff. &#160;It is incredible!Don't forget to try the homemade salsas - from salsa verde to chipotle to salsa roja, El Camion surely has something for everyone and will please even the most distinguished foodie types. I'm at the Home Depot...I'm at the Taco Truck...I'm at the combination Home Depot and Taco Truck.Much better than average taco fare at a great price. The tacos are the best - just about anything you want: carne asada, tongue, chorizo, chicken, you name it.The horchata was fantastic - a hint of coconut gives it a unique flavor.I found the tamales to be tasty but a little too 'mushy' (too much water content?) A personal preference. Very good taco stand! We came here after a Home Depot trip to try some of the delicious authentic Mexican food that we would normally expect on these restaurant on wheels.We ordered two Mexican plates which consisted of Carne Asada, black beans, Mexican rice, pico de gallo, avocado, lime and a grilled Jalapeno. It was VERY good. The meat was very well seasoned, perfect subtle char on it, tasty rice and beans, and fresh salsa and avocado. They also carry Coca Cola, in glass bottles! Nothing like a good old fashioned coke in a glass bottle, I swear it tastes better than the cans or plastic imitators.All in all, very tasty Mexican food. The reason I take a star off was due to the price. Our plate was around 9 bucks which is a little pricey for a taco truck. I'll definitely be coming back though! As taco trucks go, this one is high quality with a great menu to choose from. Everything that came up while we waited looked great, and the tacos and other fixins we ordered were delicious.The only drawback is the wait, and given that it is a truck with semi-permanence there in the Home Depot lot, there aren't many convenient places to wait (except for your car, if you are close enough).I will definitely save my appetite for this place the next time I go to that Home Depot! El Camion,I had a dream about you last night. In it was your salsa roja, your gorditas with hand-patted corn shells, your fresh slices of avocado, and giant lumps of cotija cheese. I had a dream about carmelized onions in a veggie-stuffed tamale. I am pretty sure I swam in a stinging bath of chipotle sauce dripping from a hot veggie burrito. After the dream, I awoke with a taste for warm corn chips and a strange urge to fix up my house. Fortunately, El Camion is right next to Home Depot, so you can cruise doorknobs and gallon-sized herbs while downing the best taco truck food in the city! I need to have dreams of quality, authentic, handmade food more often. They don't have tacos al pastor, but they do have gorditas, mulitas, tortas, and guts. &#160;The fish tacos are made with fish that's grilled, not deep-fried. &#160;Overall, the flavors are brighter and the textures more interesting than the food at Rancho Bravo or Flair. &#160;It doesn't really compare to the best of Burien, but El Camion certainly is one of the better taquerias in the northern half of Seattle.Service is rather slow, which is rather baffling for a taco truck. &#160;Consider going elsewhere if you are in a hurry. I'm always looking for the quick, casual, quality, and delicious food options in and around my neighborhood. &#160;El Camion definitely fulfills these criteria. &#160;We ordered tasty carnitas and fish tacos. &#160; Four tacos and a diet coke costs just a little over $8. &#160;All the ingredients were really fresh! &#160;The tamales and gorditas were also great. &#160; Definitely recommended, especially if you're in between Home Depot runs. &#160;You'll probably need a cheap meal anyway... given you just dropped a bunch of money at the depot. This is a really good Taco Truck spot at a great price. &#160;I went to the Mobile Chowdown festival and tried various number of places, but I liked El Camion the best. &#160;Flavorful carne asada, although the textures weren't all there. &#160;Carnitas were very good and the fish tacos are great since they aren't breaded and fried. &#160;Not many places do it like that. &#160;There aren't that many mexican places I would go to in the Seattle area and I would say so far, this is the best I've had. A friend of mine had these guys cater a party a couple of weekends ago. &#160;The food was amazing. &#160;Had it not been for this party, I would have never found the taco truck. &#160;They are kind of hidden in the Home Depot parking lot, look for the red umbrellas. &#160;It is worth the search - find them and prepare to dine.I ordered the chicken mole and my other favorite, cabeza tacos. &#160;Super delicious! &#160;I also ordered a pork tamale, because I was super hungry and feeling a little piggy. &#160;Yum!Now, I don't want the taco truck in Columbia City to feel neglected, I will still visit from time to time. &#160;But, this is my new favorite mobile eatery. GO HERE RIGHT NOW!I MEAN IT! If not you are missing out on the best deal on amazing food, it's not expensive and it tastes delicious. Two tacos and beans, a burrito, my new favorite adobada torta it doesn't matter. I have never had a bad food experience here. I make a point of trying to swing by and eat here once a week, even if I have to stand in the rain and wait. Everything tastes fresh and homemade like your Mexican grandmother made it (I assume that this is what it would taste like if I had a Mexican grandma at least) the service is as fast as they can go, the house made salsas and sauces are to die for. This is one of the few food places I can recommend to any one for anything. Have I mentioned they cater? This place is close to my house and it has become the default meal when we are lazy. I love the Veggie Burritos (although they tend to be the slowest item on the menu), the fish tacos, tamales....the only real complaint is it is becoming very, very popular, which means the wait is lengthy. They recently instated a pick up window and number system, so I know they are trying. I see they just opened a South Seattle location too, so things must be going well, in fact they are tweeting now: http://twitter.com/elcam&#8230; I'd never heard of a "mulita" till I tried it at El Camion. &#160;It's like a quesadilla, but on two corn tortillas, with grilled meat, avocados and green salsa melted into the cheese. &#160;Holy Lord! &#160;So Good. &#160;The grilled chicken burritos are always a hit and their carne asada tacos are above average. &#160;In the summer the horchata is refreshing and in the winter they serve Champurado (a hot, thick, slightly chocolatey beverage).The drawbacks have been mentioned in other reviews... wait time, and few tables. &#160;But the prices are terrific, the quality of the food is great, and I'm willing to sit in my car and send text messages while they grill up my food. I am giving 3 stars for the food cause everything else went totally sideways. Tips are to get here early and do not come on a reasonably decent non-rainy weekend day! &#160;The carnitas taco was delicious, as was the very generous tamale. &#160;The fish taco was a disappointment...greasy and a sauce with &#160;no flavor. &#160;What got me was that on a super busy weekend day in front of Home Depot, there are only 2 gals working. &#160;The kitchen gal was busting her butt. She ripped a tortillas, was looking for a new one while the other gal just wrapped it up regardless. They got into a debate about it in Spanish but too bad for the person getting burrito that will drop in his lap! Then the cashier gal says to the long line that she is closing at 2:30...sorry folks! big order.... HUH? It's a taco truck!go early, go weekday They have horchata. And that alone would make this worthwhile. The food is the best Mexican I've had in Seattle and usually worth the trouble. I love all the tacos and tamales they serve. I just had the gorditas and I am in love. They remind me of sopes. The gorditas are not traditional but they are amazing. They have wonderful salsa. The slow service wouldn't be a big deal if they had a sit down restaurant. One of the best taco truck burritos i've ever had and the HORCHATA is THE best here... doesnt get any better. The carnitas was so flavorful and the burrito itself is monster huge... Home Depot employees are sure lucky to have it right in front! &#160;I had hard time deciding whether its a perfect rating or not... I feel i need to give everything on the menu a try first... &#160;Great menu too, mulitas, gorditos, tacos, etc... &#160;Cannot wait to come back here... We kept hearing awesome reviews about this taco truck so we finally went. I was hesitant at first with it being right along 99 accross from the cemetary right outside of Home Depot, plus i was a newbee to the whole taco truck experience. But the place actually had a cute setup and looked pretty clean. I thought it would be crowded with dayworkers, but El Camion's customers seemed to be people from the neighborhood or Home Depot shoppers (at least when we went). Overall, it was delicious and tasted fresh. We ordered 4 fish tacos, a chicken verde tamale and chips and salsa - we finished every last bite! Not only is the food pleasing to the eye, but so are the prices ;) &#160;- everything on the menu averaged ~$2/ea. I'm from Arizona, and while I don't claim that I know "authentic" Mexican food, I do have some strong opinions on Tex-Mex, Sonoran, "Americanized" Mexican food. &#160;I like dipping hot, thin, salty chips, nearly translucent with grease, into red salsa which is both chunky and runny, swimming with bits of cilantro and little jalapeno seeds. &#160;Hatch green chiles and melted cheddar are what goes best with chicken. &#160;I prefer refried to black beans, and they should be in the form of a melty lake, fed by the sour cream runoff from atop Mt. Chimichanga, and contaminated with red sauce from the nearby Enchilada Plant, and for GOD'S SAKE stop with the parmesan cheese already. &#160;And everything should be made with lard. &#160;I guess what I'm saying is, done properly, Mexican food should be about the least healthy thing you can eat, next to movie popcorn.El Camion (or as we call it, "the Home Depot taco truck") has almost none of these things, and yet I like it better than most Mexican food in Seattle, "sit-down" restaurant or otherwise. &#160;If you've eaten taco truck before, you know the drill. &#160;This is real street food: &#160;huge, foil-wrapped burritos, tortas, dolla-fifty tacos, fresh tamales, and a selection of platos featuring carne asada and the like. &#160;I almost always love this kinda stuff, and this kinda stuff at El Camion ups the level of quality just a touch. &#160;The puerco is particularly mouth-watering. &#160;The chorizo in the breakfast burrito is very tasty, although a tad oily for my taste. &#160;If you've never tried lengua tacos, your time has come. &#160;(Yes, it's tongue. &#160;Get over it, it's delicious.) &#160;Order a horchata to drink, or a glass bottle (!) of vastly superior Mexican Coke. &#160;They also have four or five varieties of red and green salsas available for self-serve, some of which are quite hot, which is great. &#160;There is a modest seating area, which is nice in summertime, but the food is convenient enough to bring somewhere else to eat if you prefer. &#160;The food here is especially delicious if you've been wandering around Home Depot, arguing about carpet samples or some damn thing all day.If they would add a refried bean and cheese burrito to the menu, I would not only give them that fifth star I know they want from me, but I might set up a tent in the parking lot. &#160;Why can you not get a good bean-and-cheese up here? &#160;I would slap the Virgin Mary herself if it meant they would open a 24-hour Filiberto's in Seattle!By the way, you know that small, round, black metal table near the trees, between the adirondack chairs? &#160;We totally gave that to them. &#160;If you've eaten at it -- you're welcome. What everyone else said. &#160;It's pretty damn good.. I showed up here about a month ago with a couple friends and we were all excited to try this place. I honestly cannot remember what we ordered because we tried about 7 different things. All in all they were good. I must say this is the best taco truck i have been to..... almost. I think the one in Fremont is a bit better. Eff yeah! &#160;The biggest torta I've ever had. &#160;And definitely yummy -- maybe not the best in the world, but worthy nonetheless. Went to the Sodo location and had the steak taco and a fish taco, fish was my favorite. &#160;The Burrito looked delicious, will do that next time! &#160;Service was good and everything was clean. Delicious. Everything a taco truck should be and more! It's authentic (well close enough), it's fresh, it's busy , it's cheap, it's small. &#160;It's simple! &#160;For a while I felt like this was our little secret Taco Truck - but from the massive reviews alot of people know about this place. &#160;My fav is the fish tacos - they pile it on baby! &#160;From the fish, to the sauce and veggies - two fish tacos can easily fill you up. &#160;I kid you not. &#160;The carne asada burritos are GINORMOUS and filled with goodness, lots of rice, cheese and carne! &#160;Oh, and the tamales? &#160;This is where I fell in love...the pollo tamales comes wrapped in banana leaves and is steamed to perfection. &#160;I'm a big fan of 'whole in the wall' places like El Camion, Paseo and The Dish. &#160;Let's keep supporting our small and local family restaurants! Quite possibly the best Mexican food I've ever had...and I'm from San Antonio. &#160;The cochinita pibil is fantastic, the fish tacos are sublime, and the horchata is pure coconut heaven. Always a great lunch. I had gorditas with carnitas added on. Very tasty! My husband had the burrito and it was huge. &#160;It was tasty but he said next time he'll get the tacos. The food arrived pretty quick, under 10 minutes. So it seems that they have worked out their slow kinks. One complaint - the blaring music out by the tables. The best Mexican food in Seattle! &#160;I grew up in CA and the thing I missed the most was a great burrito wrapped in tin foil to-go. &#160;I stumbled across this place when I was going to the Home Depot (in the North end of the parking lot). &#160;It gave me a piece of home that I had been longing for. &#160;I work in QA and will make the trek for lunch if I have a craving, that's how good it is. May the force be with you and be worthy for such a tasty burrito is this... Mmmmm...yummy! Obviously I can't get up and go to Mexico for my taco craving so next best thing? Hit up a taco stand along Aurora! Glad we checked out this place out! Food was authentic, fresh, and just so damn good. Thank god for my leftovers! And who can argue with fresh tacos for $1.40?! Cheap and delicious? Couldn't ask for more!Taking a star off for how long it took though. We were the only ones there and still it took 20-25 minutes? But it was worth it...wish I could take just half a star off for it. my favorite Taco truck ever! &#160;Super clean, and good ingredients! &#160;nice folks working in there, I get great smiles everyday from them... i go as often as possible. &#160;Authentic too! Tried El Camion for the first time the other day in a hurry to get to work and needing something quick and in my immediate surroundings. I had heard so many things about the mulita, I just had to try one... Pretty amazing, but still, seemed like food that one could easily make at home. The fish taco was stupendous, the pork, not so great. Pretty good taco ruck, but I don't see what all the fuss is about. I'd come here again in a pinch, but I guess like at most taco trucks, it will take me like 12-15 bucks worth of al a carte food to fill me up. The salsa verde is fabulous. I guess why I gave this place 3 stars and not 4, ok, this is super picky and maybe ridiculous, but when I asked for the mulita, I didn't know it came with meat, so the girl asks me what kind of meat, and I ask, what is your favorite, to which she states the type of meat that they have. I can read. Maybe she misunderstood. I just wanted a suggestion of what she liked best, as I often do at a place that I've never been to. They generally know what is good, or that it's all good, hopefully the case. She didn't care at all. I know, I understand, it's a taco truck, don't expect service with a smile, but still... Solid taco truck. its kinda of like the Porsche of TACO trucks,better components, better food, higher quality a lil more expensive.a better analogy would be it is the skillet of taco trucksdef really &#160;good best taco truck in Seattle. the burritos are huge and cheap. the carnitas are the best i have ever had. i got three meals out of 2 tacos and an asada burrito. I could eat here everyday. tasty tacos, yummy gorditas, and fantastic sauces. &#160;i was disappointed to learn that they don't sell cabeza/barbacoa like their menu suggests. &#160;and for whatever reason they also dont do al pastor. &#160;nonetheless, they do have delicious authentic mexican food. &#160;i look forward to trying the mole and fish tacos.
one of my favorite places to get lunch on the Ave, this place serves tasty Vietnamese dishes for good prices. &#160;to top it off, their service is fast, attentive, and some really cool/friendly people work here. &#160;i only took a star off cause they painted the walls red, which i don't like in terms of atmosphere. &#160;if they change it back to white, i will put another star for the full 5!! I love this place! &#160;Started going here maybe 4 or 5 years ago, when the windows were still covered with posters. &#160;Now its been renovated over twice, with some bright new faces and menu items. &#160;Very friendly workers make it worth going to everytime.Recommend the chicken and beef vietnamese sandwiches, always fast and always delicious. &#160;The fresh coconut juice is great as well.I know a lot of UWers think of vietnamese food as summarily Pho, but I would suggest there are a lot of great vietnamese dishes to try that are not pho derivatives. &#160;Thanh Vi is a great place to try these other dishes. &#160;Most things on the menu are reasonable, including most of the noodle dishes and wonton soup.I would easily consider it the best vietnamese food on the ave. I love Thanh Vi. &#160;I love that they are so so cheap. &#160;I love their beef pho. &#160;I love their chicken pho even more. &#160;I love the bun. &#160;I love that the servers here remember you after just a few visits even though they obviously have about a million different customers.I am not crazy about their appetizers. &#160;But everything else is delish. This is my go-to spot for banh mi sandwiches (charbroiled chicken!) on the Ave. &#160;They're cheap, tasty and always served up quickly. &#160;The chick at the counter is amazingly friendly. &#160;The only other item I've tried is the bun which is pretty good. &#160;I'm always tempted to try other stuff but at 3 bucks a sandwich for lunch, how can I resist? While the service is fast and very friendly, the food is mediocre at best. &#160;The "best sandwich on the Ave" is nothing to write home about. &#160;It's dirt cheap and worth the $3 that you pay for it. &#160;And most of the entrees are bland. I used to eat here at least once a week in college...I fuckin miss this place...especially their viet sandwiches and phoseattle pho is the best, supposedly because water is the base of the taste in pho...and everybody knows seattle water is the cleanest i did hear this one time though...that someone found a cockroach in their spring roll...but maybe that's the secret to their awesome flavor We'd been looking for a new pho place since Than Brothers on Aurora started to smell like urine (no joke). I had been going there for years so this was a big disappointment. Happy to say that Thanh Vi is a step up. I like to jazz up the pho with all the trimmings and spicy sauces, but I could tell just from the aroma that this broth was better and I could even it it unadulterated if I chose. A nice pick close to home, but bad parking situation. I love to pop in here when I'm having a crappy day, because it makes my bank account, my belly, and my soul happy. I will never get tired of their cheap vegetarian mushroom Vietnamese sandwich (eat it there or soon, though, because it can get pretty soggy pretty fast). Also, every server has their own character. I especially like the cute old Vietnamese man and the adorable lady that calls me "sister" and asks me about school. I really feel loved at Than Vi! I have lived in the U-District for a year and a half and I didn't know this place existed, and it's one of my new favorites on the ave. &#160;I don't know what it's called exactly, but there is a section of the menu where you construct your own spring roll, you just choose the meat. &#160;You're presented with a glorious platter of fresh ingredients to put in your spring roll and a stack of 4 or 5 transparent spring roll shells. &#160;For an idea of the ingredients check out the photos I'm about to upload. Than Vi gets 5 stars for that dish alone, I cant wait to try out the rest of their menu. &#160;The staff is also extremely friendly and welcoming, I had a nice chat while I waited for my food. &#160;Must-try for the Ave. Super friendly service, a large menu of vermicelli, pho, appetizers, bubble tea, and it's home to the best Vietnamese sandwiches on the Ave. The lady server here is too cute and very sweet (calls you "sister", "brother", tells you to enjoy your conversation, good luck with school, etc, etc). I do have to mention that they don't have cream puffs with your pho purchase but they do take credit cards, and their lovely service makes up for not having cream puffs! :) Great banh mi sandwiches and exceptionally friendly service. &#160;I love the staff here. &#160;This is my #1 choice for Vietnamese on the Ave.
For me this little thai restaurant was a bit of a disappointment. &#160;The appetizer platter was rather bland, the batter was basic although the fried tofu was nicely done. &#160;The spicy noodles were with vermacelli than a wide nood that we mis-read but regardless it was on the dry side. &#160;The green curry just ok. &#160;Definitely more about Quantity than Quality here but will fill up a student for sure. &#160;I do have to say the owner is a very nice and pleasant lady so its good to see that this place does well. Location-wise, it's close to middle bits of UW's main campus, so that's awesome for lazy people like me unwilling to trek up to Thai Tom for some decent Thai food.The food is great, too--I've heard my Thai friends say that it's the most authentic restaurant they can find the Seattle area. I'm not much of an authority, but the phad thai is delicious and not ketchupy, unlike the dish in so many other Thai restaurants, so I believe them.I also love that their spice levels aren't muted! :) You don't have to order 5+ stars just to finally feel some heat. My face is on FIRE! &#160;My food was extremely spicy and did not give up flavor to do so.This place is a block from my house and I finally decided to try it per a roommates reccomendation. &#160;It did not disappoint.The thai tea here is excellent and I am full, which sometimes is not the case after my meal (I'm talking to you thai tom).I will definitely be back. Thai curry lunch special was awesome. . . Till I found a hair in it : ( gross but the food was pretty good until that realization. &#160;I would eat there again. I'm surprised this place is averaging 4 stars! (as of 08/08/10) Well, it is not a atrocious restaurant, but it is definitely not the best...I ordered tom yum noodle soup. Although it tasted alright (maybe a bit too sweet), it really was nothing spectacular. My boyfriend ordered some stir-fry noodles with tofu. The portion size was fairly small, and the noodles simply sucked (dry, flavourless, and limp).The staff were nice and courteous, but the food was very mediocre. I don't think we would go back. :-( Considering how terrible some of the Thai food on the Ave is, Little Thai seems pretty good. I appreciate that they offer a Pad Thai/Curry/Spring Roll combo so I don't have to make the difficult decision of "do I order a curry or go with a noodle dish?"The food is just ok, but sometimes ok is good enough. Blown away? Well, no. Not exactly. With serious "just-another-Thai-place" expectations, I walked into Little Thai for just another Thai meal, and I would indeed suppose that is what I got.I tried the phad thai and phad see ew. Both at the medium spice level. Which was a good amount, I thought. The phad see ew tasted richly of soy and spice, and the phad that was pretty decent. Caveat seems to be that the portions aren't as large as some other thai places for the same price. Also, the noodles in the phad thai were overall cut too small, making it a bit more difficult to eat with chopsticks. The variety of veggies in the phad see ew also just consisted of broccoli, not terribly interesting.Price wasn't too bad. Service was prompt and friendly. I have places on The Ave that I like more for Thai food, but I wouldn't say that it wasn't a decent meal. Crappy thai restaurants load up your plate with rice and noodles to make you think you are getting a good value.This place loads up your plate with vegetables. Try the classic thai plate, I counted 10 different freakin kinds. So freakin good. The desserts are weird but unique, cheap, and I personally love em. Came here again on the request of a friend and again, wasn't wowed like I thought I would be. My pad thai was really, really sour (even without adding the lime) and the chicken was drier than I am used to.In conclusion, I am still not jumping on this bandwagon. Have a feeling that its "underground" quality may be part of its mystique and appeal but would rather just eat delicious food elsewhere. I have eaten here a handful of times and each experience is delightful. Very good food and great service! Don't expect to pay for the ambiance, although this restaurant is roomy and functional. With an exceptional food selection and owners that are ready to customize your dish to your liking (the Sisters rock!), I would no doubt bring my parents and Thai friends to this restaurant. I believe they have the best tasting Lard Nard in the U-district. I've been going for years and will continue to go. Great value for delicious Thai food. This place was my first foray into Thai cuisine about 4 years ago and I would still come here everyday if I could. During my visit today it seems that they have changed management, but my regular chicken pad thai was just as good as I remembered it. Price range is very reasonable and I will definitely recommend this place for anyone craving Thai cuisine. I've been going to this place since college, so maybe there's a bit of nostalgia. &#160;But having been to northern Thailand, and prefering to make Thai food at home rather than going out, Little Thai is pretty good for the area - the atmosphere is homey, and the service is good. I like the calamari pad see iw, and the tom kha gai. Who needs yet another positive review of this popular U. District restaurant? &#160;It's definitely not in danger of failing anytime soon. &#160;I've been coming here for years. &#160;The last few times I was here for lunch, it was so packed with University types &#160;that I had to wait for a table and ended up sitting with someone I didn't know. &#160;This was fortuitous, since my table mate turned out to be a brilliant conversationalist. &#160;Yes, it's an unpretentious ma-and-pa type Asian restaurant with a large menu, a hostess that remembers what you like, and food that arrives almost immediately after you order it. &#160;But the point is, the dishes are yummy and the prices unbeatable. If you take the highest and lowest ratings for this place and toss them, you end up with ratings that are justly deserved. &#160;No mistake about it--this is a GOOD PLACE. &#160;May it live long and prosper. . . . SIMPLY THE BEST THAI FOOD PLACE ON THE AVE. That and ThaiTom too O___O;;The food here is amazing! The spiciness levels are good, and everything about this place is great! Yes it may be a bit pricey but this place is the absolute best place for good Thai food. Stay away from the other places and you won't be sorry. The atmosphere is very nice and relaxed, and the manager's and people here are friendly and most importantly this place is great food and filling! My favorite Thai restaurant on the ave. The place is clean and very consistent. The location is very close to UW campus, so most of its customers are students. The prices are cheap and the staff is attentive. Pro: great price for the food, fastCon: decor is a little old, it a basement. Upon continual disappointments over the Thai experience on the "Ave" around the UW area, I came to try this place with a glimpse of last hope.It is slightly off the Ave, on the 43rd St., so finding it was hard. Liking the place and food was definitely NOT hard. It has arguably the best Thai food around the University District (second to perhaps Thai Tom), and the fact that it is situated closer to rest of the school buildings should bring a lot of customers in.The service is nice, food variety is great (no complaint on the portion either), and if I had some time I would try everything on the menu. This is a Thai restaurant everybody should go to if you ever get to the U. District.
Ordered from these guys last week and had a great experience. I'm pretty basic with my Chinese Food demands, so I went with Sweet and Sour chicken, fried rice, and some egg roles. The chicken and the egg roles were awesome. The sauce came separately so the chicken wasn't soggy at all. The egg roles were crispy and had great flavor/texture.The fried rice was a little disappointing. The pork was a bit too chewy and the rice itself was kind of flavorless. But it was still fine. I ate it.I'm ordering from them again tonight! Let's hope it goes just as well. I think this place deserves more stars than it's got. We grew up in Chicago eating Chinese food often and we thought finding good Chinese here in Seattle would be a no-brainer. &#160;Sadly, China First continues the streak of sub-par Asian food we've continued to find. &#160; &#160; &#160;  &#160; &#160; We ordered the Family Style China First Fire Plate. &#160;The rice and potstickers were just ok. &#160;The barbecued pork and BBQ beef were slightly better. &#160; The almond fried chicken was good, but forgettable . &#160;The won-ton soup was bland and the sweet and sour pork was a disaster, mainly because they forgot the sweet and sour sauce. &#160; But the pork part tasted like freezer-burned, then fried pork bits. &#160;I doubt the sauce would have been able to save it . &#160;The order was over a half-hour late on top of everything else, but Grub Hub comped us $25 so we weren't eating angry. &#160;It was just really disappointing. &#160;First and last time. I really don't think I've been this disappointed with a meal in a long time. &#160;I haven't been to CF in over a year because of a bad experience. &#160;And this time when I went back, it was worse than I remember.The most bland, tasteless egg flour soup. &#160;Fried rice? &#160;Try dried rice. &#160;The most gooey, uncooked orange chicken I've ever had. &#160;And cold tea. &#160;Cold. Tea. &#160;How does that even happen?Not to mention the floor shook with every step, and the waitress said no more than three words to me, and refused to make eye contact. Bland and tasteless across the boards. &#160;The best I can say is that for a handsome fee, they brought calories to my door. &#160;We threw away nearly all of it. I cannot believe I came back again!I was hanging out with two friends. We got some deli food from a grocery store. We were still hungry. One of them suggested to order online from China First. But the wait would be 45 minutes or so. I said no, I already got sick from China First last week and I won't go to China First. Well, the food is cheap and they serve fast. I was also super hungry and so I agreed we would order takeout from there. So we placed two orders via the phone. It was weird because they didn't ask what kind of soup we wanted with each order. They didn't ask us to identify how spicy we wanted the entrees.We went to the restaurant to get our food. They were served fast. When we walked in, the young lady server saw us and just stared at us without greetings. Yes no big deal. I was like ok maybe we should go up to the cashier and ask. We paid for the food and waited for a few minutes. The same young lady then handed over the takeout bag without saying any other words.We got back and the food looked okay. The Mongolian Beef entree was full of onions. We saw lots of hot pepper in both entrees and then we realized we had no idea how spicy each dish would be. Fortunately they weren't too spicy or anything.I was super hungry so I also had some of the food even though I know I should not have done so. I felt sick again within the next hour. The same kind of sickness feelings like I had last week. I had to puke out some of the food and felt slightly better.It is just too bad. This place is cheap. The owner seems super nice. The staff are not so friendly, on the other hand.I don't know how and why my friends can eat here on a weekly basis and don't get sick from here.I don't think I will be back, no matter how badly my friend wants food from here. Getting sick twice in a row is just not normal. I ordered a delivery from China First tonight. &#160;Terrible mistake. It took almost 2 hours to receive my food. If I had been told that they expected a 2 hour wait, I would've ordered elsewhere. When I asked the status of my order I was told the driver would be there in a few minutes. I had to ask again 20 minutes later with the same response. It was still another 20 minutes after my 2nd inquiry. When the food arrived, I didn't get an apology until after I had commented that maybe they should apologize. The manager was unwilling to do anything to satisfy my frustration. Getting the food inside, I discovered that it wasn't even very good. The soup was almost entirely noodles, with hardly any vegetables or meat at all, and had very little flavor. The General Tso chicken actually impressed me with how poorly made it was. I'm not sure how you can make a breaded chicken dish where the chicken is dry and hard, but the breading is soggy. The chicken also didn't have any of the sauce (which makes me wonder even more how it was soggy), and was completely flavorless. I had ordered it hot, but there was no spiciness whatsoever. I will definitely NEVER order from this place again. P.S. When a customer complains that his food took much longer than it should have, he's not looking for excuses. He's looking for an apology. And customers shouldn't have to fish for an apology! If you know that the customer ordered their food almost 2 hours ago, you should apologize immediately to them!!! Granted it is very cheap Chinese food, but hey we all need it everyone once in a while if we don't want our wallets to be broken in half. That being said the food is of average quality, the speed is fast, costumer service is great, and the price is very CHEAP! I can't think of anything to complain about other than the not the most amazing food quality. I would totally recommend! My friends and I were craving chinese food, and since china first is really the only one on the ave, we decided to give a go. The food was very average, however for 5 dollars it seemed pretty alright to me. Service was also pretty good. The servers were friendly and accommodating. I would go back again! The food is not good and an over use of MSG is used to compensate. &#160;I got my order delivered. &#160;It was not correct and though they said they would bring me the correct items I never heard back. &#160;There is no way I will use China First again. Is it possible to give negative stars? If so, I'd like to give this place negative stars. A million negative stars.I ordered delivery from China First last night. womp womp, worst dinner I've ever eaten. I ordered the vegetarian chow mein and the broccoli in garlic sauce. I'm pretty sure I asked to make both items extra spicy. Aaaaaaand I'm 100% certain they used sugar instead of salt in my broccoli.Oh..and my chow mein was flavorless and came swimming in a pool of water..wtf?SO, I had ice cream for dinner instead and it was excellent!!!
While strolling down the Ave one day, I just happened to pass by this place again. Now normally I wouldn't dare to show my face at a place after I give it one star. Some people take their retribution very seriously, but I strive to rate fairly and accurately nevertheless. But a sign right by the entrance on the Ave to this place caught my eye. I took a picture of it to prove that as unbelievable as it sounds, I'm not making this up, but I'll also type it out here verbatim:BANQUET GROUP DISCOUNTSDepending on your needs, we will create a Banquet for you. Decide how much you want to spend and our chef will prepare a special menu for you. Average cost; generally $15 to $18 per person. Minmum Banquet size: 8 persons.In case the problems here weren't obvious enough, I'll spell them out: - How in the world is this supposed to be a discount? How does a meal here jump from less than eight dollars to "$15 to $18 per person"? Since when does doubling the price equal a discount? - I thought this restaurant's goal was to make their prices competitive and as low as humanly possible in order to attract broke college students. Doesn't this idea of an overpriced banquet run against the whole point of this restaurant's existence? - This restaurant's food is terrible; how can they possibly be trusted to make a proper meal, let alone a full-blown banquet? - Since when do restaurants ask you how much you want to spend, and then prepare something for you around that specified amount, all the while telling you how much you should spend so you actually don't have as much freedom as you think? - You can get authentic Chinese food at the International District that's so much better for cheaper. Why would anyone come to the Ave of all places to look for decent Chinese food? - Why arbitrarily restrict their minimum banquet size to eight people when they can hardly draw in customers in the first place? - If anyone needed to feed eight people, wouldn't they have already chosen to go somewhere else? There's a bunch of pizza places on the Ave that open late and even deliver; they can easily feed eight people at a mere fraction of the price. Jesus, $15 times eight people is $120; can you remember the last time you spent $120 on pizza for eight people?So there you have it. Just when I thought this place couldn't get any worse, they decide to advertise this ridiculous deal and prove me wrong. What a joke of a business. I used to think the Jack in the Box nearby was the worst place in the University District, but this place really gives them a run for their money. I really didn't want to say anything bad about this place at first; it's nothing personal. But it's just unacceptable for a business to run like this. If this place went bankrupt soon, I can't think of anything of value that would be lost. I'm a fan by default. New China Express is a fading memory, and this is the only place nearby you can get duck (I think?) The century egg congee is also quite tasty and adventurous. Too bad the rest of the menu is boring. If they were open until 2, the duck alone would be worth it. China First used to be the place to go if you were looking for good, somewhat americanized chinese food. It has been consistently good for 30 years and the lunch special price could not be beat. I went here recently and could not stand more than one bite of my food. I am NOT a picky eater, but the food was just disgusting. &#160;Ugh. Never again. One of my favorite places. Even though their food is not consistent in flavors: sometime it's great and sometimes it's not --but as long as I can get some cheap Chinese food that tastes good on a daily basis, I will keep going to China First.
I saw their sign, and was like, lunch for under 7 bucks? I was sold so I entered. &#160;Ordered a generic chicken dish (basically breaded fried chicken chunks covered is brown gooey sauce). &#160;It was bleh. &#160;The meal also came with free soup, which tasted so nasty (I don't remember what is was called but it look like egg drop soup- the weird thing is I actually love egg drop soup, just not this one). &#160;By nasty I mean, it tasted rotten - like expired soup, or they used some expired ingredient. &#160;If that makes any sense! &#160;The chicken wasn't any better, tastes old. Yes, it's cheap and you get a lot of food but the food is crap. Basically my whole experience here was less than wonderful, and because I was so scared the first time, I have never returned, and I don't plan on to. My heart belongs to China First for their "bad" Chinese food. I love it! I wandered here over 10yrs after seeing their sign, advertising 3.25 lunch special. I was sold. Sweet and sour pork or chicken, Hot and sour soup, with regular or fried rice, and I'm a happy camper.In the past 2-3 years they did raise their prices twice. A bit of a shock for me but not many business were able to keep their lunch price for as long as they did. I still come here.The cute short little Asian lady always greets me, but somehow got stuck in her head that I order almond chicken. I never ordered that! Except for the one time I thought she said "sweet and sour" and out came almond chicken, which was just ok. I ordered s&amp;s the next time I came here though. Heh.Service is lightning fast even during the busy lunch hour. They have two large round tables that seat single diners with a lazy susan (hey, give me that hot oil!). &#160;They have a pot of hot chili oil that they make in-house. I consume half of it each time I'm there. I LOVE it. I tried buying some, but they told me to come back. LOL.They do take-out but you might as well eat in and enjoy their unlimited tea and hot oil. :D They also have a frequent buyer card. Man, if they started that back in 1997? I would have been rich! Rich in 3.25 lunch specials, I tells ya.I will be coming here this month. Disclaimer: I love greasy American Chinese food.I am also a broke student and like to get a lot of food for my money. This is why I love China First. Their lunch and dinner specials are a sweet sweet deal, and I can't stay away. Unfortunately, the chicken in their dishes tends to be rather fatty at times, but I've never had trouble with the pork in garlic sauce. My veggie friend usually gets the scallops and they're pretty tasty. The service is very hit and miss... I've had some awesome servers and some times where I had to get my chopsticks and hot oil myself. But if you love your cheap Chinese food like I do and find it a comfort food, this'll do you fine. Something happened to this place.It was always a cheap restaurant. But given that, the food was pretty good. I loved the $5 chicken and black bean sauce, with hot and sour soup to start. And boy was it fast service. The last couple of times I came here the food seemed to have taken a dive. What's with the cold hard pork slices with ketchup and hot mustard? And the chicken and black bean sauce disappeared. Even the soup seemed somehow tasteless..... Just got one of the tofu lunch specials, it was pretty good. &#160;Nice quantity. &#160;The food was prepared very quickly.I tried to get another stamp on the card they gave me the first time I came (order 10 meals get 1 free), but the guy completely ignored it...he actually brushed it away(?). &#160;So I guess they aren't doing that anymore...which is strange. Please do not consider this to be a restaurant. &#160;You've been warned.Bad.....really bad. &#160;Forget about the great low prices others have mentioned in their posted reviews....let's talk quality of food.Entertainment card used. &#160;Maybe because i showed the coupon b4 i ordered ?When I arrived there were two waitresses and one (1) other table occupied by one (1) individual on a Sunday afternoon at apprx 5 pm...he was gone and finished with his meal before i placed my order. &#160;Thus...there was not a single person in the restaurant when I ordered food....or what was disguised as food...please read on.The first danger signal was watching a waitress pick up bevg glasses from a table. &#160;Never seen someone clear a table quite that fast. &#160;But in doing so she picked up beverage glasses sticking her fingers inside all the glasses...gross and extremely dangerous to public health.I ordered 2 entrees...one a chicken dish and the other fried fish. &#160;I inquired several times what type of fish ? &#160;i don't know she responded. &#160;It's fried, she said. &#160;Tilapia ? &#160;Salmon ? (I asked) &#160;Her final response...it's white meat. &#160;It was like she had never had the question asked of her. &#160;And in my opinion, there was not a language barrier.The chicken dish arrived. &#160;Nice presentation. &#160;Small fried balls surrounded by orange sauce. &#160;I could not find any chicken. &#160;I cut open ball after ball....no chicken. &#160;I waited for my second dish..the "white meat" fish......and waited...and waited...After 15 minutes, I asked the waitress where it was....."They are getting it." &#160;(Hmmmm....Who is THEY ?"I asked for the manager.He arrives.Could you please help me find the chicken ?Manager: &#160;It's inside the fried balls. &#160;It's there...see it ? &#160;(No...I don't) &#160;There &#160;...cut open the larger ball...See it ? &#160;(Yes...I do. &#160;But there's only one &#160;large piece in a sea of little balls of fried something) &#160;Look, the manager says...It's breaded chicken. &#160;If you don't like it ...I can make it over again (Ok..fair enough) or give you a free meal. &#160;(I don't want a free meal..it's not about the cost. &#160;I'm hungry and need the protein that i thought was implied when I ordered Orange Chicken.)And then he said something that really fried MY balls:"What do you expect...it's Sunday night."NOTE: &#160;My second dish still hasn't been rec'd.The manager walked back into the kitchen. &#160;I too walked back to the kitchen to have one last word with the manager. &#160;I noticed upon entering the kitchen that my other dish was sitting on the counter ready to be expedited to me. &#160;It actually looked good but had a glaze over the top of it that anyone would conclude meant that it had been sitting there for some time.Why the fish dish never made it to my table is beyond me.China First ?.............More like:China LAST.Enough said. Ok Cockroaches YUCK!!! Called the health department a couple times and no one has done anything. That whole block has cockroaches including the smoke shop (Sams), the only place that does not seem to have a problem on that block is chipotle OK so its your typical fare of chinese. I think though that best thing about was the amount of food we got for 27 bucks that is awesome. I love chinese because you have leftovers for days and when your on a budget that is a big plus. Good food great price only reason it wasn't a 5 star is that it seemed liked delivery took forever. My wife is Chinese and isn't very picky, but she made it clear that she will never be back here. &#160;First, the main dishes were too salty. &#160;then, they charge $2.50 for rice (which is kinda like charging extra for the bread when ordering a sandwich). &#160;We has a coupon from the Entertainment book and first we were told that the menu selections were limited for us and i think that the coupon was one of the reasons they charged for the rice. &#160;Dinner for two with no beverage and a 2-for-1 coupon hit over $20. &#160;If the food would have been good, that might be one thing - but being over charged and nickel and dimed for a bad meal is another. &#160;there are better options in the area.
I went here for lunch a few weeks back. I had a po' boy sandwich (~$13). It was good but not great. It had well thought-out flavors, but the bread was waaay to chewy for this sort of sandwich. The oysters ended up smooshing all their guts out as I was taking the first bite. Love oysters, but their insides can be somewhat off-putting to some people.I would like to give it a 3.5. The food was good, service was great, and the atmosphere was very pleasant. It was a bit on the pricey side, so that's why I am not giving it a 4.
Pros:1) A delicious five course meal with generous helpings. The highlight of course was the filo dough chicken almond pie coated in sugar powder. 2) Exotic decor with lots of attention to detail! right down to the uniforms of the waitstaffCons:1) Seating is awkward. You end up sitting embarrassingly close to other customers and bumping knees, elbows etc.2) Possibly one of the most unattractive belly dancers I have ever seen. It's a good thing that pie was so tasty. I was actually pretty excited to try this place out, as my boyfriend has never had Moroccan food and I have had pretty good experiences at other restaurants. We came on a Saturday night, and we were told on their website that they were having a belly dancer perfom. How fun! &#160;Unfortunately, our lackluster experience started when we opened the door. Our waitress seemed like she was stoned out of her mind. She repeated her name a few times and sat us down by the coat rack. As others on here state, this is communal seating, which is fun for large groups of friends but kind of a bummer if you're on a date. That's the case with other Moroccan restaurants I've been to though, so I can't complain too much.But &#160;what I can complain about is the cleanliness. Clean your floor if you're going to force people to sit and eat so close to it! Food crumbs and stains everywhere, the poor excuses for cushions you can stay alfloat on are literally coming apart at the seams or duct taped. Our stoned waitress came back with one of my favorite parts of going to a Moroccan restaurant: The hand washing!....Goddamnit, she blew it again! Whisking away the water pot before we can get our hands under the water she was ladling out of it. I managed to get my left arm slightly damp and wiped it off with the giant Motel towel they gave us to use. Menus were doled out to us and our blazed waitress unenthusiastically told us how to order, and it's pretty straight forward: You only have to make one decision during this whole five course meal they were serving... and that is what your entree was going to be.Easy enough, as the spicy chicken with potatoes looked to be the most appetizing. My BF ordered lamb and pear? He's braver than I. Anyway, I'll get to the main point of this review. The food sucked.The best part was the fried &#160;filo-beef-egg-dessert-whatever the hell with powdered sugar on top. Bread was provided for the salad and lentil soup, and our waitress was getting visibly annoyed that we took more than two pieces of inch long bread cubes to eat our meal with. By the way, no forks are provided and there is literally no way to eat the salad without at least 6 pieces each. After our plates were quickly whisked away, our main course came.WHOMP, WHOMP.BF's meal was inedible. The lamb was overcooked, lukewarm and way too sweetened by the pear sauce. No savory spices to counteract the overbearing pear syrup. My meal was on the verge of being cold and was the most bland "spicy" dish I've ever eaten. The chicken was dry and tasteless. Our loveable waitress came back with the water pot (now with orange oil!) and managed to ladle the water over our hands this time. Dessert quickly came, which comprised of decent tasting baklava and mint tea. Hard to eff that up, though. At least the tea was hot!Belly dancer was conveniently "on her break" during the entire duration of our meal. Only about to come out as we were gathering our things and hastening towards the door.We opted not to wait. So I say this about the experience. Instead of spending $70 on deplorable food, go a block north and buy about 20 hot dogs from the street vendor. Easily a better value! I had been to Moroccan restaurants before. &#160;So I kinda "knew the drill" but to a newcomer, our server didn't really explain how it works that well. &#160;For example, what do you do with the big towel they give you? &#160;Then they disrupted the "eat with your hands" experience by bringing utensils along with the entrees.There were some other little service issues, like a delay in greeting arriving customers at the door, and no offer to make use of the obvious visible coat rack. &#160;But all of these minor details would be forgivable if the food was awesome. &#160;Unfortunately, it was not.Salad course didn't have much variety compared to other Moroccan places I have tried. &#160;And the base of the salad appeared to iceberg lettuce. &#160;You could argue that's traditional, but my impression was they were looking to cut food cost. &#160;The filling in the b'stilla was bland. &#160;Chicken was served on the bone, and was very overcooked, dry, and bland. &#160;Sauce was bland. &#160;Lamb brochette was ok, but a bit dry. &#160;The rice that came with it was good, but I see why the fork accompanied it- not the right texture to possibly be eaten with your hands. This was my first visit here as well as my first Moroccan food experience...And no disrespect to the owners, but Moroccan cuisine is definitely not my thing. I didn't really care for the communal eating with the hands (it was messy and gave me a Howard Hughes-ish feeling watching everyone grab at the same dish) I also thought the flavors were too much on the sweet side for my liking. With that said, I thought the restaurant was pretty cool and the service was awesome. They definitely helped us out by giving our party plates and forks. The staff also made sure our party was properly served by keeping an eye on our drinks and food. The atmosphere was fun inside, looks like you are inside a big tent and the belly dancer made it entertaining. Although, I will agree with the other reviews that this place could use a good cleaning. I came here and had the 5 course meal a while back. &#160;I had the vegetarian breka. Now, I know nothing about Moroccan food: I agree that the bread, soup, salad and fruit salad are pretty good. The entree is the weakest point. &#160;It was kind of what I expected which was similar spices/flavors to Indian and Middle Eastern food. It seemed a little less flavorful though. We enjoyed the experience with the decor and belly dancer as everyone else did. &#160;I think Paul B. is right that everyone experiences the same thing, which isn't that cool.Overall though, this place is fun, the food is decent and the prices are pretty good (esp. for Belltown). This place never fails to please! I recently went here for my birthdays and it was just as fun as I remember 3 birthdays ago and another 4 birthdays before that! I went with a party of 5 and ordered the Royal Feast. Not only did Marrakesh comfortably accommodate our group, but we were also able to enjoy live belly dancing as well. In fact, my friend and I got a free mini belly dancing lesson, but of course, we couldn't compare to their dancer so we just eventually busted out our booty pops.When I've gotten the Royal Feast in years past, there was always a dish representing evey land animal on this Earth: beef, pork, chicken, lamb, and hare. And every dish was succulent, tender, and full of flavorful spices. My only complaint my last visit was that every dish but 1 had chicken and ironically enough, I don't eat chicken. Go figure my luck. But that's no fault of Marrakesh. The rest of my party was highly satisfied and I still enjoyed my lamb dish. I will continue to come to Marrakesh for special occasions and I highly recommend that for anyone eating in a big group and looking for delicious food, lounging on comfy couches and floor cushions, eating with your hands, live belly dancing, and overall merriment and adventure, Marrakesh is the place to be! Went here on Valentine's day (last night) and it was delicious!We got the "Valentine's Day Feast".. Super yummy. I had never had Moroccan food before so I was pretty impressed. Lamb w/ eggplant= delicious. Chicken w/ lemon= delicious! The powdered sugar appetizer was meh but everything else was really good! Pretty pricy, but all in all it was a pleasant experience. My friend's father accurately described the experience here as "tired" - there's just nothing new about this place. &#160;The food was lackluster. &#160;We had two chicken dishes and though they were drenched in sauce, the meat was still very dry. &#160;The couscous tasted like they cooked it in canned broth and had a strong gamey flavor. &#160;The hare was probably the best of the bunch since it was more tender than the chicken but it was still uninspiring. &#160;I didn't try the lamb, but I had a bite of the bitter(!) eggplant that was cooked with it.I felt a bit embarrassed for the belly dancer. &#160;She wasn't very good, and no one paid attention to her. &#160;Having her dance near me was kind of an unappetizing experience. &#160;I was glad when she was done so I could stop making sporadic awkward eye contact.The layout of the restaurant is a little weird too. &#160;Half the group sits on the bench against the wall and the other half sits on cushions on the floor. &#160;I was on the floor and had to constantly look up to talk to the other half of my table. &#160;They really should seat everyone at the same height.Despite the perceived good value ($20pp for soup, salad, entree, and dessert), I won't be coming again. Absolutely amazing time to be had here! My fiance decided to take me here on a surprise dinner, and at first I was worried because I was dressed up and in heels and when the doors opened I realized people were mostly sitting on the floor on decorative pillows! But have no fear, there were benches too! So, on a Saturday there were a lot of people, a belly dancer and LOTS OF DELICIOUS FOOD! So everyone gets the basic, a lentil-type of soup, an appetizer plate and drinks----to be eaten by hand! But don't worry because they come by with water to wash your hands (but wash your hands anyway before hand because it seems to be only water they wash your hands with). Then you pick your own main dish and then you get a dessert to be hand eaten again! We chose the lamb and chicken kabob without adventuring out towards the better delicious dishes like couscous chicken, which looked SO good! So make sure you adventure out to something delicious! And as someone who doesn't like lamb very much, their lamb here was so tasty! A must try! The decor was awesome, you feel like you were in the middle of an Arabian dessert with the tent like ceilings and decor---YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE FOR EVERYTHING IT OFFERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! More like 3.5 but I will round up.I have never had Moroccan food before so when I was told we were coming here for a surprise birthday I got a little excited.I loved the atmosphere here. There was a mixture of benches and pillows to sit on. I also like the tapestries on the wall. The place felt pretty authentic, but since this is my first time eating Moroccan food, what do I know?The 5-course meal started off with a lentil soup that you had to drink from a bowl. It was very tasty and one of the best lentil soups I have had. I was actually looking around to see if anyone didn't finish theirs so I could have it, but everyone liked it too much. Bastards!The next dish was the salad Marrakesh that looked more like a bean dip (it is actually eggplant/carrot puree with lettuce and chopped tomato). The waitress gave us some bread to dip in it, but it was still pretty hard to keep everything on the bread. It was a very tasty dish.Then came the B'stilla Royale, which is kind of like a pastry with powdered sugar on top and some kind of meat in the middle. I wasn't a big fan of it but one of our dining companions pretty much ate a whole one himself.Now comes the main course. I had the Chicken Brochette which was a very flavorful and tender grilled chicken on skewers with rice. I thought it was excellent. The main course seemed like a hit or miss with some people. I also liked the lemon chicken dish one of my friends ordered, but another friend hated her lamb dish. This is surprising because I thought the lamb dish should have been great. After complaining about it for some time, she asked if I would like a bite and I had to decline.Finally, we had dessert which someone at our table compared it to chunky apple sauce. It was pretty much chopped up apples with I think some cinnamon. It was ok and kind of refreshing. We were also given some peppermint tea which I thought was pretty good.During the meal we got to see a belly dancer. It was pretty fun to watch but I thought it was a little weird when the dancer dropped a dollar, a little girl about five years old picked it up and tried to hand it to the belly dancer and she made her put it in her pants like a stripper.There is also a ceremonial hand washing before and after the meal. Everyone at the table puts their hands over the big metal pot and the server pores warm water over your hands. There was also this stuff they put on your hands to make them smell good, but it smelled too much like a urinal cake to me.Also I would like to mention that there are no refills on soda. I did not know this when I ordered and got the soda at the beginning of the meal. If you do order soda, let them know you want it with the main course.Overall, it was a fun experience but there were aspects that kept me from giving it a full four star. I will probably come here again and try another main dish.Zipzap Zubidy Bop! This was our pre-Big Picture, What's Open on a Monday Night? choice, and I have to say - we've made better choices. [Although seeing Kick Ass was an excellent choice, and I urge you to make it.]We might have gone on an off night, but this was a weirdly tasteless experience. &#160;Everything was perfunctory, from the obligatory handwashing to the leaden baklava [although upon hearing that we were going to the movies, they nicely boxed it for us.] &#160;I found the mixture of ground chicken and powdered sugar in a flaky crust kind of....well...let's say I wouldn't willingly eat that again. &#160;The chicken in my main course was nice and tender, but the entrees had that murky brown goo look. &#160;Now perhaps I'm not their intended market. &#160;But if this is what the Middle East is eating when they go out for a grand dinner, I know why my people continue to wander for 40 years in the desert. &#160;That mana must have tasted a lot better than this. Excellent, filling menu with fantastic atmosphere. &#160;It's fun to sit on the floor pillows, get your hands washed at the table, and dine on delicious Moroccan food. &#160;Recommend if...A) You're an adventurer...the place is like nowhere I've eaten. &#160;B) You like Middle Eastern food...menu is filling and yummy. &#160;C) You're on a first date...this place will give you plenty to talk about. &#160;Plus you can sit directly on pillows on the floor, perfect for your food coma nap after. My other half and I love this place. We went here for our 1year and are always finding some sort of festive excuse to go back. The atmosphere is definitely the main attraction, and the food is fucking awesome. We ordered two dinners and a bottle of wine and our bill was 60 bucks. Considering we've spent over a 100 eating out at shitty diners, this was awesome. The server was awesome too. He was polite and helpful, not intrusive at all. I hate when servers are constantly checking on you every few minutes asking if you need anything else, etc. Not here. He did his job, but left us alone. The presentation of the food was super cool too...especially desert. I would def recommend Marrakesh if youre looking for a dim lit place to eat some good food in a comfortable, exotic atmosphere. And.....that orange water they put on your head after eating is the shit. The most awkward dining experience ever. &#160;I have been to Marrakesh the city and I liked the food and the service a lot. &#160;So, I was stoked to try Marrakesh the restaurant, but no no no.First, they do this big show about how you are going to eat with your hands. Our anglo waitress, dressed in some approximation of Morrocan garb/pajamas from King Street, handed us these large white super bleached dead-hooker-motel towels. It was so authentic! Just like Morocco! Then she brought over a fancy teapot and some kind of urn for us to "wash" our hands - washing in this little Moroccan corner of Belltown involves just a sprinkle of lukewarm water from a surly blonde. &#160;It was far too much interaction with a waitress who obviously didn't want anything to do with us. Also, they then bring you forks later, so it makes no sense. &#160;So authentic! So Morocco! &#160;You get a few courses - soup/salad course, powdered sugar-chicken thing, main dish, then dessert and mint tea. &#160;During each of these courses, sometimes even while me or the mister were in mid-bite - pajama-party girl would come by and reach down to grab the plate THAT I WAS STILL EATING FROM asking simultaneously - "are you still working on?" &#160;I almost had to slap her hand a couple of times. How exotic! How very North African!Also, the seating is totally funked up. &#160;There are low tables with a floor cushion on one side and a sort of shared bench on the other. &#160;The cushion is too low to eat comfortably and the bench is too high. &#160;Stupid. &#160;Also, you are seated within inches of the people next to you. &#160;So you can hear every second of their insipid conversation about their desperate attempts to find some sort of value in their sad and pathetic lives. &#160;Except for the little East Indian girl on the other side of me - she can sit inches from me whenever she wants, totally adorable and funny. The friendly, beautiful toddler was the only thing that actually truly reminded me of Morocco.Then, the food was crap. &#160;My lamb kebobs were super dry and super salty. &#160;The lentil soup was a total afterthought. Also - I found it very rude that when the waitress came around with the giant bread receptacle and said that we were each allowed "two to three pieces of bread." What the hell? &#160;Our $75 bill only pays for four to six pieces of bread for our table and not one piece more. &#160;You are gross and unfriendly, Marrakesh restaurant. &#160;You made my Friday night kind of suck. &#160;You get two stars only because your mint tea was delicious. Authentic, enchanting and fun. Savory and sweet dishes that will surprise and challenge your taste buds! A royal feast served under colorful tapestry's on our seat cushions and low rise tables. Reservations are a MUST and assume dinner will be a 2-hour event with any group over two people. Notice something missing on the tables? That would be silverware! Be prepared to use your hands for dinner. However, hand washing at the table and orange blossom water is part of the fun (forks come with the main entree). Highlights: Lentil soup Phyllo dough with ground chicken &amp; powdered sugar various lamb and chicken dishes mixed with fruits and spices in unusual combinations Mint tea and milk pudding = group consensus seemed to be that it was all very good in a unique way. Casa Beer and table wine were basic- and at least inexpensive enough. Charming belly dancer can balance a sword on her head and swivel her hips around even the drunkest bachelor in the house. Pretty talented. Total bill worked out to $33/person for a multi-course meal and super unique experience it's a must. Came here with three people on a Wednesday night. Fun atmosphere/experience with groups sprawled out on the perimeters, sitting on cushions, eating with fingers, and Moroccan belly dancing! We got the "feast" so we could sample everything. The taste for everything was alright... I've actually been to Morocco and had the traditional fare there, so I'm not just applying my "american tastebuds" to an ethnic cuisine. Every meat was bland and salvaged by some sauce or syrup. It came out to be $35/pp. Kind of pricey for just eating chicken and bread. Service was decent. Other than the 30 min dancing and Moroccan beer, don't think I'd come back. This is my first Yelp review, and I hope I don't embarrass myself, but I enjoyed the service at Marrakesh enough that it merited a review.First off I'll say that I've never experienced anything claiming to be Moroccan so I can't attest to the authenticity of the Moroccan cuisine. I can tell you that I enjoyed every aspect of my meal though. The waiter was very friendly, very quick to seat us and serve us, and very attentive. &#160;After the waiter washed our hands we were served our first course: the lentil soup and salad. Not normally a soup or salad fan, but they both paired excellently with the fresh bread.The second course was a sort of Phyllo dough pie with a (I believe) chicken and potato style filling with sugar and cinnamon on top. While I was unsure on mixing the savory and sweet, it turned out to be an excellent precursor to the main course. Oh, and they'll make it vegetarian for you as well if you ask.The third course was our main entree choices. I got the braised hare, my wife got the couscous marrakesh with lamb, and a friend of ours got the lamb skewers. While I definitely enjoyed my hare (the bread tasted fantastic dipped in the sauce the hare was served in), I had a taste of the lamb and it was fantastic. Very tender and excellently spiced - it'll be what I order next time. After our main course our hands were washed again and then followed up with a light spritz of a citrus infused water.Dessert was then served - a very delicious coconut pudding paired with a hot mint tea. It was the perfect cap to a meal as we endeavored to set back out into the crazy wind we were having. Over all, the atmosphere was very cozy, the seating was comfortable, the waitstaff was very friendly, and the meal was delicious. I already can't wait to go again.-Danual Every time I visit Seattle, I visit a very good friend of mine and we find a food experience that's something you wouldn't normally go out for. &#160;Conveniently, Penny Arcade Expo was up in Seattle, so I punctuated one of my nights with a trip to Belltown and the microcosmic North African atmosphere of Marrakesh.For three people, the prix fixe option was plenty. &#160;You'll enjoy some lentil soup, some bread and Moroccan-style salad. &#160;They'll bring out a hot pastry filled with meat and dusted with cinnamon and sugar, definitely my favorite of the meal. &#160;Then a set of four dishes will be brought, with glazed meats on the bone and some wonderful couscous. &#160;You'll typically eat with your hands until the glazed dishes come out, at which point you'll be thankful for your fork. &#160;The meal is topped off with a bit of honeyed and spiced tea, and a small chopped apple salad that finishes the lot off.I'm not in a position to appraise Marrakesh's food against other Moroccan food, so I hope my ignorance will be pardoned when I say that two of the main courses had sauces that were a bit too thick and sweet.You'll likely sit on the floor, or on very low benches. &#160;Depending on when you arrive, there might be a belly dancer. &#160;Atmospherically, this place is a neat experience for a first time visitor, and definitely worth it in conjunction with some quite tasty food. &#160;The service is fair, though we had a reservation and still had to wait fifteen minutes, which is always a bit obnoxious even if I am willing to grant that the place was quite busy.Four stars is fair, as I'm not sure that I'd make Marrakesh a regular thing if I lived close by. &#160;Still, it is an experience, and certainly worth a look for the adventurous diner! Great experience. Five course meal for under twenty bucks, good food, dancer, nice atmosphere. The only real knock I can give it is location, Middle of Seattle and hard to find parking, but that's my own personal preference, most people probably don't mind where it's at. Recommend This was a good choice for &#160;a authentic Moroccan food experience. &#160;When you walk inside the place smells and feels like you are under a dessert tent about to eat with some North African traders &#160;The only bad thing is that this restaurant in my opinion has a old and undesirable carpet . &#160;The service was good and the food was delicious. &#160;I recommend going with a group and make sure to prepare yourself for a belly dance performance. &#160;The prices were a bit high but this place is all about the experience. Was in Seattle for my b-day weekend and scouted this place out as it had a belly dancer. As a novice dancer I had to come see after all the great reviews I heard about the place. We went for a late dinner after seeing a burlesque show just prior and were quickly seated. The waitress was perfect. Nice and and very friendly. We were seated next to a bachelorette party and across from a bachelor party, this place is popular. We ordered the 5 course dinner. The soup was flavorful as was the salad. That puff pastry thing was delicious and our main courses were mouth watering delicious. It ends with fresh fruit and tea. Can't forget the decor either. The seating was fun and the feeling of being in a tent made you forget you were in a busy city. The dancer was great and pulled up a few willing victims and it was very entertaining. Next time I am in Seattle I will most definitely be back! Went to Marrakesh last night with a group of friends, we had a really great time and the atmosphere is especially appropriate for this time of year. It was so nice to walk from the cold blustery night into a warm welcoming palace.The inside of the dining room is lined with fabric, the floors covered with rugs. You can sit on the bench that goes along the wall or on leather covered floor cushions.To start your meal, when they offer you bread, take more than a handful. Make a little mound of bread if you have to. Because you'll be using it to eat the salad as well as the rest of the meal. They have utensils too, but that's not quite as fun.We ordered the Royale Feast, feeling all too much like commoners having to deal with incessant news reports on the recent royal engagement. I don't know the names of all the dishes served, but the chicken with olives was amazing. &#160;The Royale Feast also includes a main course special, which was a chicken with potatoes. &#160;There was an insane amount of food. Our waitress was delightful, and the belly dancer was dancing the entire time that it took for us to eat (2 hours). The Moroccan wine is worth a try. Loved this place, belly dancer was very fun, food was great! &#160;The waiteress was a little bratty(she hurried everything along, defintely not playing into the arab &#160;culture of relaxing and socializing while eating).*****= food*****=atmosphere***=service Not a bad place, not a great place. &#160;Just A-OK as Yelp describes it.Ordered the one higher grand feast for a little more than a dollar more than the regular menu item. &#160;Basically 6 courses, instead of 5. &#160;Not a bad deal.I will say that the chicken dishes while overly moist, were borderline soggy. &#160;The lamb was yummy.They have beer and wine I believe, nothing to write home about.You can ask for utensils if you want. &#160;Which we had to with certain dishes, or when we ran out of bread. &#160;Service was mediocre at best due to not filling up our waters promptly nor getting us more bread to eat with our dishes. &#160;Overall it's an experience. &#160;You aren't going there for stellar food. This place ROCKS. 1. The food is great. 2. There is a belly dancer at night, who balances a knife on different parts of her body... while dancing. Yes, this is true people. She was awesome. We tipped her. This place is fantastic overall. Great environment, and great service. The waiters speak french, which is super cool because you really get the full effect. Low tables with little pillows for chairs. SO cute! The way they serve their meals is also pretty cool. They already have a five course meal set up; you just pick your entree.1. Salad: You get to eat everything with you hands. They bring you some fantastic soft and spiced bread that you can eat this little fresh garden salad with. Very good. 2. Cute little soup that gets you ready for the real thing.3. Ok... this is where it gets FOR REAL. Phyllo dough with ground meat inside and powdered sugar on top. It's like a Meat Donut. OH my gosh. Amazing.4. Main dish. Every person gets their own. I got the braised lamb, which was absolutely amazing. Tender, succulent, and flavorful. It was great. I was speechless... really. 5. Dessert. You get a nice light coconut pudding. Its sweet. You really don't even need a dessert because you WILL be so full. Overall, I loved this place. Great experience. Great food. Great service. And come on, Belly dancer? ... I'm there. Check it out. Authentic Eats. Great food, great atmosphere, great location. I love Marrakesh. While parking can occasionally be a bit of a hassle depending on the day and time you go it is well worth circling Belltown for 20 minutes trying to find a place to fit your mid size SUV. This place is a flat rate - $18 per person and they always deliver. The only thing you pick is your entree and the rest you leave up to the restaurant. I would suggest when choosing your entree choose something unique and exotic - those really are the best dishes. Once I tried just standard roasted chicken and it was a bit dry - but the hare is to die for. So delicious. They have belly dancing after 6pm and the most wonderful tea you've ever tasted. They also have these little hand washing rituals that I won't tell you too much about because it's more entertaining when you have no idea what you're doing. Their salad, soups and bread is amazing. The bread is just toted around in this giant wicker basket and you just pull out as many as you'd like (don't be shy, you can use this as a spoon for every meal since they only give you a fork with your entree). Also, the owner is not afraid to call you out if you get something boring or if you all order the same thing. This place is a lot of fun and definitely worth checking out! Their menu doesn't change very often, but there is definitely something for everyone. Yay! I'm a fan :-)This was our first visit &#160;to a Moroccan restaurant and glad we made that choice!... from the hustle of Seattle downtown, you get transported to a Moroccan tent :-)Good:# 5 course menu with less than $20/head!# Appetizers started with a Soup that tasted like a SouthIndian Sambar :p, Marrakesh Salad, a egg mix vegetable puff topped with sugar &amp; cinnamon# Main Course - Chicken Brochette (kebab) was the best!# Good Vegetarian options!- the Veggies in our group were not disappointed with the choices they had.# Belly dancing :-) ..no comments :p ... she even teaches you to dance ;)# Ambiance - in a chaotic, traffic infested downtown. it's all peaceful inside this Moroccan tent.# extra tips for Server who was quite helpful.Bad:# no prior warning on Sweet dishes!. the Main course Chicken was so sweet (Honey Glazed with apricots!) and Lamb dish looked &amp; tasted like it was marinated in chocolate!!!... a prior warning would have helped us but our mistake too in not asking for spice levels.# the restaurant is in downtown so no prizes for guessing our parking experiences (hunt for a golden spot took time!)Overall experience was amazing and would love to go out again :) I love this place!The first time I ate at Marrakesh, I hadn't had much ethnic food before, but that meal definitely made me a fan of Moroccan. There are five courses, all eaten with your hands: soup, salad, B'stilla Royale, main dish, and dessert (and mint tea). My favorite of these is, without a doubt, the B'stilla Royale--a pastry filled with chicken, sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon. (Oh, just writing those words is making my mouth water!) I've had their prune chicken and apricot chicken, and both were fantastic (the latter probably being my favorite).There are belly dancers on some nights, so be ready for that, too! I was walking in Belltown with a friend and just happened to spot this restaurant. We hadnt tried Moroccan food before so thought of trying it out... From the outside, it didnt seem very impressive but the inside was very different. The ambience is very good. It gives a very warm feeling. The service is very good. Our server greeted us very nicely and helped us figure out what to order. I tried the Tagine of Lamb &amp; Eggplant, and loved it!Overall: Recommended Autentic and enchanting restaurant in Beltown! I celebrated my birthday there with my best friends. The service is great and the food was soooo delicious! They gave us a special for groups menu and we were lucky to have a &#160;charming belly dancer on our table! So much fun that night!Prices are reasonable for a multi- course meal and the experience you get there is so unique!!!!! &#160;Its a must to go!!!! Came for a birthday dinner. Had to wait outside (there is next to no room inside to wait and be seated). I think we finally got in about 20 min. after our reservation. It was so dimly lit - I'd like to see it with full lights on. Very old - needs a refresh on interior design.If you have never been, it IS an exciting experience. I definitely enjoyed the company of my friends but the food was just o.k. I did enjoy the uniqueness of the food and the five course meal. It allows you to experience many different flavors. I had the catch of the day which was salmon. It was over-cooked but edible. I tend to be a little picky with my fish and shellfish and expect for the price premium of most seafood, that it is cook appropriately. I found the belly dancing distracting but some found it very fun. I guess it depends on what you are there for. &#160;Good for a first experience - just my 2 cents. Marrakesh is a fun place to eat dinner with friends. I've eaten here twice. The food is tender and flavorful, and the restaurant is decorated like a Moroccan tent. Some tips to help you enjoy Marrakesh: 1. Don't wear a short skirt; you may be sitting on the floor. 2. Be prepared to eat with your hands.3. Practice some belly dancing moves before you go; you may receive a mini belly dancing lesson in the middle of the restaurant.4. Go with a few of your hygienic friends. :) FOOD WAS GOOD, SERVICE WAS A-OK.We had 8 people here for a birthday dinner. I have never tried Moroccan food before and this was my first time having a full experience. I do enjoy the atmosphere the restaurant has. I felt really homey once I walked in. There was a belly dancer in the middle of the restaurant performing. I was pleasantly surprised. The dancer actually invited one of us to go dance with her which was quite fun. If the service was a little better they would've gotten a 5 star. Especially the price you paid to go eat there, and that the restaurant being in Belltown, I would expect a little better service. I especially like their fresh salad, it was amazing with the bread~! I signed up for Yelp just so that I could post this review.Either people have completely different palates, or completely different expectations from this place. Our experience with the place couldn't be better. I've only been to two other Moroccan restaurants (San Jose, CA and San Pedro, CA) but this one had them easily beat in all aspects.We were there with a group of 6 on Monday (Labor Day) and when we arrived, there were already about 10 people waiting at the door for the restaurant to open.Our order was taken right away, and food arrived pretty quickly. Throughout the dinner the waitress couldn't be more helpful, and we easily had her bring us bread 4 or 5 times and not complain once... in fact I think she had fun with us! Starters were great, there was no lentil soup left in our cups, we nearly licked the plates after the salads, and the only reason there was any B'stilla left, was that instead of individual servings, there was one big pastry, and that turned out a little hard to eat. For the main, the waitress suggested Royal Feast and we were treated to: Chicken with Lemon and Olives, Chicken with Honey and Prunes, Lamb with Eggplant, Couscous Marrakesh with Lamb, Chicken Brochette and Chicken with Apricot. Again, hardly anything was left, all the juices sopped up by the breads... The dessert of milk pudding (I think) with almonds and coconuts, and the mint tea (skillfully poured from about 5 feet above the glasses) ended a tasty, satisfying meal. For those of you who say it may not be authentic, I say "I don't know how it's SUPPOSED to taste, but I'll be back, because it tasted fantastic!". Oh, and it was only $19.95 a person. I could probably spend $12 at McDonald's to get as full and be nowhere near as happy! North African food has a tradition of being milder than it's southernly neighbors. Get the Lamb M'Rouzia, (sweet, w honey and startlingly tender).. The house wine is PHENOMENAL, but it is also common for me to insist on sweet mint tea throughout the entire meal. The Harira (lentil soup) is usually great, only once did it taste somewhat watered down. If you want more bread, ask for it. It's better to use bread than your fork, cuz you'll look stupid. Dirty hands? You have a towel in your lap. And the ROSE water is coming. This is also what your dessert will be scented with, unless they serve their yogurt or baklava instead of the apple-pear-rosewater-lemon-cinnamon salad. Fabulous. It's not supposed to be spicy, it's supposed to be rich, hearty, flavorful, with an aptitude for meshing sweet and savory in the same dish. the roasting methods and palette of n.Africa coupled with the craft and subtlety of Mediterranean France, conspire to deliver a very nice meal for around 17/person, before tip/ beverages. I wish the belly dancer was a little more -er - Essaouira about it- a little less cabaret, but for white folks already dazzled by cushions on the floor, I'm sure it didn't make any difference... The owner, Abraham, is also very committed and jovial. Showed my ex fianc&#233; and I a lot of care when we were looking to cater our wedding. This review should be titled: "Seduced by the belly dancer... And I didn't particularly like it."We were sat at a table on the floor with little poof chairs. The themed interior was nice and not too kitschy. We had the lentil soup, followed by a phyllo dough pastry filled with ground meat &amp; topped with cinnamon &amp; powdered sugar. That was super tasty. Eaten all by hand, it's warm, sweet &amp; savory. Then we chose two main dishes; vegetable couscous &amp; braised hare tagine. The couscous was good but nothing special &amp; quite a task to eat with your fingers as it's loose and tiny bits that you desperately want to get into your mouth. The hare was so tender and delicious in the gravy it had been cooked in. Melt in your mouth. They served Moroccan mint tea for dessert and it's refreshingly nice. I often think of it still and wish I could get more. How could I also forget to mention the belly dancer who had a habit of making "sexy eyes" at everyone and asked them to join her dancing. I did not take her up on this offer and I have to live with that... I think I'll deal just fine. She was a bit too much for my style. This place is a cool meal for something different and some dishes can be quite special. For an adventure, I'd say give Marrakesh a try. Just beware that the belly dancer is going to be looking for her next partner. ;-P I came here last week for a Girls' Night Out, and what a fun place!At first, when I saw the restaurant from the outside, I wasn't impressed...and the "waiting area" was even worse. &#160;The place was packed and the front of the house could only cater to a handful of people. &#160;Everyone else either had to wait outside, or step slightly in towards the establishment, which meant standing next to other diners that were already seated. &#160;However, we were waiting around the same time the belly dancer started her performance, so that was a plus. &#160;It even made up for the fact that we HAD reservations, and still had to wait to be seated! &#160;The food was delicious! For around $19, you get a five-course meal, and I couldn't complain about any of it. &#160;First, you are served a salad and lentil soup. &#160;The salad was okay, but nothing special. &#160;The soup, however, was warm and comforting. &#160;Next, came the B'stilla Royale. &#160;Ground chicken + egg+ cinnamon/powdered sugar = GREATNESS. &#160;It shouldn't work, but somehow, it DOES. &#160;I would go back just for that dish. &#160;But the main course was amazing too! &#160;I ordered the lamb and eggplant, and I was not disappointed. &#160;Tender, juicy lamb...yumm! &#160;It wasn't accompanied by much, but the shear preparation of the lamb was enough to satisfy my palate. &#160;The dinner ended with a light fruit salad and mint tea. &#160;Nothing special, but again, satisfying enough to end my meal. &#160;This place is more for the experience than just a meal, so be prepared to be here for a while. &#160;It's about slowing down to enjoy food and friends, so if you're in a rush to get somewhere, I wouldn't recommend this place. This was definitely a really cool experience! &#160;My boyfriend and I had dinner here on a week night and the place was decently filled. &#160;There was a belly dancer dancing when we arrived. &#160;The place was pretty cool, it feels like I was in Morocco when I was there. &#160;My boyfriend and I ordered 2 lamb dishes. &#160;There was lentil soup and salad that you eat with your hands with really delicious bread. &#160;There was a chef's special dish which was a phylo pastry with ground chicken and cinnamon and icing sugar. &#160;That was an interesting experiences. &#160;The lamb main course was good, there was a lot of meat. &#160;The desert was a milk coconut putting and honey mint tea. &#160;The mint tea was delicious. &#160;I have to say this was definitely an experience.Recommended. &#160;Definitely want to go back some time. This was my friend's and mien's first experience of Moroccan food, and we are now totally FANS! Marrakesh has a "royal dinner' meal that's about $20 a person. Perfect for Moroccan food newbies like us. First they bring a bison and warm water so you can wash your hands. I couldn't even repeat the name of the dishes after he told us, so bare with just descriptions of the food :) First dish is a lentil soup, very similar to Indian lentil soup IMO. Second dish is a yummy salad with some kind of dip. You grab a couple pieces of bread from a basket and eat the salad and dip with your hands. Third dish was an appetizer, it was a yummy ground chicken and pork mixture with onions and other spices inside a flake pastry topped with powdered sugar and Cinnamon. powdered and sugar?!? don't knock it before you try it, it was AMAZING!!! Fourth dishes* was the entrees with four diff rent dishes. Lamb with eggplant, almond chicken, chicken with olives, Chicken with Apricot, and a couscous with lamb, raisins and other yummy stuff. All were very Delicious. With four people we couldn't finish it, and had left overs of each dish to split between the two couples. Last dish was the desert, which was some kind of pudding with almonds and coconut and a Delicious mint tea. If you have wanted to try Moroccan food, head here with a group and get the royal feast, you will LOVE it. We went to Marrakesh for my birthday party. There's nothing like making your friends sit on the floor on poufs and telling them they can't use forks! A few years prior, I had gone to Mamounia on Cap. Hill, and boy do I miss that place. Marrakesh has inferior food and WAY inferior belly dancers, imo.You know what though? It gets the job done. It's a fun environment no matter what. Like I said, you sit on the floor on poufs at pretty much the same level as your food. You eat with your hands. You listen to ethnic music and watch a belly dancer shimmy around. There's really nothing else like it.Until I find a place as good as Mamounia, Marrakesh will have to do. What a cute little place in a crappy neighborhood! While there were all sorts running around Belltown and even though this place looked a little sketch from the outside, the inside is such a surprise! In a good way! There are pillows all over the floor, tapestries, cute little benches with pillows, low tables, dim lighting, and an exotic feel. Very cozy although the seat closest to the street is FREEZING and a little drafty from what feels like outside wind. I'd recommend any other table except for this one. We were greeted by a very friendly, Caucasian woman which was a bit of a surprise. She brought us to our table and and was quick to answer any questions that we had. There were three different options for meals depending on how hungry you were and what you wanted to spend. I came with my husband and a friend and since my husband is extremely picky, we ended up ordering "a la carte" and won't eat most things on the menu. I ordered the chicken and 6 (or 7) vegetables...I forget how many were in it...but it came over a bed of couscous and was oh so delicious! The flavor was phenomenal. I loved how the couscous was drenched in the chicken juices and the veggies were tender and perfectly seasoned. (The veggies included potatoes, squash, zucchini, raisins (?) chickpeas and a couple others that I couldn't identify but were good. The portion was pretty hearty and I was stuffed by the end. My husband ordered the beef brochette which was great but a little meager portion-wise. He said he was still a little hungry when he was done eating. It came with rice on the side which he ate up.My friend had the lemon chicken with olives which was awesome, too. It just seems like you can't go wrong with the various options.I loved how they cleaned our hands before with hot water and then sprinkled our hands with orange water at the end. I loved the smell...reminded me of...well...Morocco.The food was fairly reasonably priced if not a little on the pricey side for what it was. We split the bill 3 ways for 3 entrees and one lentil soup which came to around $13. I guess it was fair but I would not have paid as much for my husband's beef since it only had two skewers. Love this place! The outside of the restaurant is a little plain. &#160;It's pretty insignificant to look at from the street. &#160;There are no windows to see inside or to offer natural lighting in the dining area. &#160;The inside is somewhat small and gets a little stuffy after awhile. &#160;Seating is rather unusual. &#160;There are small, round tables around the perimeter which have small poufs on one side and bench seating on the opposite side. &#160;If you sit on the bench, you're leaning over the table while you eat...if you sit on the pouf, the table is a little high and you seriously work you core muscles during the meal. &#160;After you order you meal, which is served in five courses, the waiter will rinse your hands with water in a large basin. &#160;They provide a white, large towel for your napkin which was a slightly odd but strangely convenient. &#160;I personally did not mind the hand washing or the towel napkins. &#160;My meal consisted of Traditional Lentil Soup and Salads Marrakesh. &#160;The soup is served in a small bowl that you sip from. &#160;It was fine. &#160;The salad is served on a large platter to share with your group. &#160;Using the bread to scoop and sop up the salad turned out to be fun for me but not so much for my wife. &#160;If a fork will make you feel more comfortable, all you need do is ask and the staff will kindly provide one for you. &#160;The third course was called B'stilla Royale and consisted of a ground meat filled pasty dusted with powdered sugar. &#160;It's sounded peculiar, but it tasted sweet...I liked it. &#160;For the main course, I ordered the Tagine of Lamb M'Rouzia. &#160;Delicious! &#160;I also tried my wife's Tagine of Chicken with Honey and Prunes which was also very nice. &#160;The meat is cooked to a very tender perfection. &#160;Finally, the dessert came. &#160;It was a sort of coconut pudding/yogurt and a hot Mint Tea. &#160;I was not a fan of the pudding/yogurt, but the tea was tasty. &#160;For entertainment they offer a traditional belly dancer. &#160;She interacts with the patrons, asking if you'd like to dance with her. &#160;It's a little distracting, but I think it added a fun touch. &#160;Overall, I think the place would be great for a group of four or more. &#160;The food is reasonably priced and good. An 8:30 reservation here got us in at 9:05. &#160;They were busy, their food is great, but they let walk-ins that arrived after us get seated before us! &#160;Needless to say, I was disappointed. &#160;I'm going to be fair and give them 3 stars because their service is good once you get in and their people are nice. Come hungry and in clothes you don't mind getting smelly! The food is awesome and the experience is even better! I was a &#160;little nervous about the food at first, but there is nothing to be afraid about. We went here on a sunday evening after realizing that oddly, the nearby Petra is shut on Sundays. Located in belltown, it is an Ahhh moment when you enter marrakesh- it looks like you've stumbled into a rich arabian gypsy tent- there are no windows to connect to the outer world, and the decor is rich red and blue/green, with little carpets hanging on the walls all over and low seating cushions lining the tables. The waiter was super friendly and helpful, and helped us pick tasty items from the ala carte menu. My friends picked the tagine of braised hare and chicken sheesh kabob, and I took the vegetarian delight. the waiter washed our hands in a vat (?) before serving, which was a nice touch.Food was however, less of a 'delight' than we expected. The sheesh kabob and veggie delight came with saffron rice, but the braised hare just came with 4 big pieces of hare in a gravy, with...nothing. When we asked for rice, the waiter recommended bread instead, and my friend felt a little stupid taking 6-8 pieces of little bread lumps from a huge basket, with no place to keep them but directly on the table. Our food was all in all, average. The flavors were too mild to appeal to us. And having lived in the middle-east for a while where we had tasted african food, this didnt quite match up.All in all, a good experience with good alcohol options as well. But go for the experience without expecting too much from the food. I couldn't imagine coming here just for a casual dinner. This place is definitely for occasions and parties. Walking inside, you're in a tent-like setting with dim lighting and it's all very neat to absorb for a few minutes. I came here for my birthday and the owner was able to accommodate a room for 45 people which was neat. When making reservations on the phone, he was very helpful and patient with my constant increasing of party size - I called back about 4 times.As for the food itself, it was pretty good. You eat with your hands and everything is very mystified which draws the appeal of all the Western patrons. Come to think of it, it didn't seem like there were any native Moroccan people enjoying the food. Makes you wonder actually about the underlying implications here...The big downer about this place is that everyone shares the same experience. Every one who has gone here pretty much orders the same thing, sees the same belly-dancer, and basically tells the same story. This is what throws me off and lowers my rating. I want a unique experience from the places I visit, and with everyone's experience so standardized, I am left a bit stoic. I would come here once but never again because of this. So much to say about this wonderful restaurant on the corner of 2nd and Battery. Nestled in the heart of Bell town, Marrakesh offers the finest in North African dinings. I've been to a few other Morracon restaurants in the past but none comes close.  &#160; &#160; &#160;When entering this establisment for the first time, you cant help but feel a sense of excitement, from the dim lighting, carpeted walls and blanketed cieling, to the elegent dining furniture which either has you siting on a round chair floor level or a pillowed couch embracing there round tables which you can probably sleep on ( Sure felt like it after my meal :) It a dining experience like no other. To add to the experience there are no open windows here which is great! It helps eliminates the distractions of the outside world.  &#160; &#160; &#160;Now the food... there is so much to say when describing the cuisine here. Moroccon food is by far one of my favorites. Its great how you can incorporate fruits, nuts and sweets to a helping of beef, chicken and lamb. I just loved every bite this place has to offer. Theres one dish that stood out. Its a Pastry type pie with ground beef inside and topped off with powdered sugar. Sure is fun when you have a party of six digging in with there hands (No Utensils here guys! ) then having to wife poweder sugar off after every bite. &#160; &#160;From the lounge sofa seating to the belly dancing entertainment, decent priced meals and amazing hospitality you cannot go wrong with Marakesh. Its just a fun place to go especially with a bunch of friends or family. The dining experience is so different from the norm. Make sure you go on the nights that they have Belly Dancing, just dont get suckered into dancing with them :) Enjoy! Yikes. Went out to dinner for my mom's birthday last year and hadn't really thought about the place until now. The service was great, the staff was really friendly and the ambiance of the restaurant was pretty neat too... the food, though, definitely fell by the wayside. Everything seemed pretty spiceless and monotone, I just felt wholly underwhelmed by all the dishes try as I might to like them. The mint tea though... was amazing. Definitely the highlight of the night! Over all the experience was pretty good, however &#160;I had to ask for water twice and when the waitress came to pour my water she did not fill up any other glasses my table and so she was requested to return multiple times. We had a party of 21 and only one waitress to perform the hand washing and deliver all of our food and drinks. The food was amazing, my husband and I ordered the lamb and it literally fell off the bone with a delicate spicy flavor. &#160;Pillows are a bit worn and could use some freshening, but otherwise the decor was lovely and the belly dancing was fun and entertaining. We had a huge fiasco with the bill as the staff did not create separate tickets (separate tickets were requested when reservations were made) and the waitress miscounted our bill and tried to say that a $100 of our $825 group total bill was not payed but when we added up the credit card receipts she had miscalculated and also had not added in the cash that some of our party had paid with. My husband and I plan on returning as the experience and food were memorable and the issue seemed to be the difficulty in taking care of a large group of people. My husband and brother in law ended up covering a $30 balance, I do not believe that anybody in our party did not pay for their share but it was a huge mess and we were not willing to dispute and cause a scene and as none of us actually counted all the cash that was handed over and all the people that paid cash left before we settled the bill. I've been here as well as Kasbash in Greenwood. &#160;The food at the Marrakesh is better. &#160;Although neither Kasbah or Marrakesh are really like Morocco. It seems like this is a good birthday spot, and lo and behold, that's the very reason why I was here one night!I was skeptical about having Moroccan food because I'm not familiar with the cuisine, and I'm the kind of person who sticks with her favorites. I'm sure glad I tried the food, though, because it was absolutely delicious! The apricot glazed chicken was VERY YUMMY and will put regular ol' roast chicken to shame.I did subtract one star just because our reservation for 7pm was pushed back to 7:30, and they did not call to warn us about the change beforehand, so we had about 30 minutes to kill prior to dinner. In spite of this, the atmosphere of the restaurant is really fun - soft lighting, pillowed seating and carpeted walls, belly dancing, authentic music. I wouldn't mind coming here for another birthday dinner at all! Was here years ago and LOVED it. The experience was amazing - we ate with our hands, and we the brought over a pot to wash them, the restaurant was decorated as a tent and had colorful carpet all around as if we were someplace else. There may have been one other party there at the time.Great pre-fixe meals and prices. This time, the food was just as good, but a lot more people. The place has definitely gotten more popular. There was also a belly dancer. I have not yet found an authentic Moroccan Restaurant like this in NY ! If you're all about being entertained and having a new experience while dining, go here.I've never had Moroccan food before but I was pretty impressed by the way it was presented. I think the food would not have been as good if the experience wasn't what it was.The setting is probably authentic Moroccan (but I wouldn't know because this is the first time I've been that type of restaurant).I guess you have to make reservations but we didn't since we were out of towners and happened to be staying at the condos across the street. The owner was cool enough to give us a table.The "royal feast" deal is probably your best bet if you dont know what to order. It's a 4 course meal (soup, salad, 5 different main dishes to try and a dessert).The food tasted fresh and wasn't too heavy with oil so it settled well in my tummy.The belly dancing lady was cool. He skinny ass really knew how to shake it!This is a good place to go for dinner and if you enjoy new dining experiences. Very cool atmosphere, like being in a Moroccan tent at sunset. I tried the honey and almond lamb, which was pretty good. I was disappointed that none of the entrees come a la carte. You have to pay $19 for the full five(?) course meal, with soup, salad, bread, entree, tea, and dessert. I don't think I would've gone in if I would've known about that, because I was not hungry enough to eat all that. The seating is a little uncomfortable for the people who have to sit on the floor cushions. You have your back to the belly dancer and she kept flinging her long scarf over people's heads while they were eating. Funny to watch, but not so much if you're the victim. :-) Eaten here a few times over the years, and never really left that satisfied. Not sure why we returned for the subsequent trips, other than maybe that it's something different. You eat with your hands, so make sure you trust the hygiene of everyone in your party lol. Some of the dishes were pretty good, while most were a bit too sweet, which left a couple people with stomachaches afterwards. Still, it's a cool environment with live belly dancing, so it's interesting, to say the least. Went to this restaurant last nite, 5/6/2011, with a group of around 10 friends. &#160;This was a Fri. nite and the place was about 3/4 packed. &#160;Still, we received what I thought was appropriately efficient service, and the waitstaff was &#160;pleasant and welcoming. &#160;The decor, of course, was very nice... looks like you just stepped into a Bedouin tent filled with with carpets, textiles, decorations, etc. &#160;That said.... THE FOOD IS BAD! &#160;I'm a good cook and I admittedly like spicy, bold food. &#160;I probably like my food spicier than the average person does. &#160;I'm handicapping for that as I write this. &#160;I eat some meat but DO NOT eat lamb, which many of the courses featured. &#160;As for the people who got meat... it was just a few chunks of meat on a plate, naked except for some sauce. &#160;No sides or anything. &#160;Before bringing the meals (which did take a LONG time!), they brought out a big basket of bread, which was just plain white bread cut into approx. &#160; 1-1/2-inch squares, completely bland except for the SLIGHTEST HINT of anise. &#160;Then they brought out a big "salad platter," which was iceberg lettuce with little tomato squares, and something else that was indistinguishable. &#160;It was barely enough for 10 hungry people, and there were no utinsels, so we tried to &#160;use the bread to pick up the salad with. &#160;But the bread squares weren't big enough to pick up anything in. &#160;So it became a big, sloppy mess, salad all over the place, kinda unappetizing. &#160;Worst of all: &#160;it was SO BLAND! &#160;It just had no flavor at all.Then they brought out this mystery thing, also on a big platter for everyone to dig into with hands... and it was this big phyllo dough thing with a brown crumbly mixture of stuff underneath it that was just barely sweet-tasting and no other discernable flavors. &#160; Much conversation as to what this was.. did it have meat in it? &#160;Most said they thought so; I would swear it didn't. &#160;Crumbly phyllo dough and powdered sugar all over our fingers and clothes. &#160; NOT a winner, though some of my friends said they liked it OK. Most disappointing was the main course. &#160;I'd opted for the "Moroccan vegetarian delight." &#160;I was hungry for veggies -- and the meat dishes had none. &#160; Anyways, I figured that if VEGGIES were the MAIN STAR of the dish, there'd be plenty of them, and they'd be cooked with care. &#160;WRONG! &#160;The "veggies" &#160;came on humongous beds of either white rice or couscous. &#160;Mine were on rice, which was DRY and HARD. &#160;Inedible! &#160;The veggies were small, soggy lumps of pale, yellowish-green, overcooked squash-y stuff in a sauce with a few pale-green olives. &#160;This vegetable "topping" equalled about 1/2-3/4 cup by volume, max. &#160;AND IT WAS TASTELESS! &#160;I COULD NOT EAT IT! &#160;Sadly, there were no condiments at all on the tables to fix the food up with.. &#160;I finally summoned the waittress and asked her to PLEASE BRING ME SOME SEASONINGS. &#160;Like, some kind of sauce to put on the dry, dry rice, and something to season the splotz of veggie stuff lying on top of it. &#160;She returned at length, bringing a pretty tasty brown sauce and a small bowl of "lemon and cilantro" juice. &#160;THIS MADE THE DINNER PALATABLE. Yay!Dessert was &#160;small bowls of white "coconut pudding" stuff -- again, just barely, barely sweet. &#160; No "exotic" seasonings detectable, like cardamom or cinnamon. &#160;SIIIIIGH. &#160;The tea was good though!The &#160;whole dinner cost $20.00 plus extras + tip.... NOT worth it! &#160;Just the day before, I'd gone to the California Pizza Kitchen -- for the first time ever -- and by chance I'd ordered the "Moroccan chicken salad." &#160;It was chock-full of romaine, dates, beets, avocado, chicken and gobs more stuff. &#160;DEFINITELY a robust, filling, healthy, &#160;enjoyable meal, at less than half the price! &#160; Crazy, huh. &#160; Oh Yeah! &#160;Forgot about the soup. The soup, a somewhat thin lentil soup, was the first thing they brought. &#160;The soup was good. &#160;Not great, and not much of it... but good. The restaurant has a beautiful decor: the ceiling is draped with a colorful, striped fabric that gives the impression of a canvas tent. &#160;You sit on floor cushions in large groups or twos. &#160;At first, they wash your hands because the first few dishes (lentil soup, salad and B'Stilla Royale) are eaten with your hands. &#160;The B'Stilla Royale is a rare treat: a pastry filled with meat and topped with cinnamon and powdered sugar. &#160;We also had chicken tangine with honey and prunes and a beef brochette; both were delicious. &#160;They finish off by washing your hands again and then sprinkling you with rose water.The service was very fast and friendly, and the presentation is unique. &#160;The belly dancer provides entertainment between courses, going so far as to teach large groups her trade.Overall, this restaurant is fantastic; the food, atmosphere and other elements combine for a unique experience. Great double date with my sister and her bf. The food was amazing, mixing many different flavors that I would never pair together. Powdered sugar and ground chicken in filo dough; apricot chicken (THE BEST); a salsa salad that you eat with bread. &#160;A truly unique experience and 5 course dinner for $20 each plus tip.Don't make plans or be on a time constraint, this is an event and we were there for nearly two hours just enjoying the relaxing atmosphere. I generally dislike the chaos of Seattle, but this could bring me back time and time again. You feel like you've stepped out of Seattle and into a richly decorated tent in Morocco. The Royal Feast is an amazing deal at $20/person (less than $2 more than the normal 5-course meal, but you need at least 4 people). The menu is pre-set, which is great because we would have had a hard time choosing for ourselves. The only items that were less than amazing were the lentil soup (it would have been much better with a bit more spice to it) and the coconut pudding-ish dessert. But you could totally skip those and be extremely full and satisfied with the rest of the Royal Feast. Every other part of it blew our minds and busted our bellies. We literally had to loosen our belts, there was so much delicious food put in front of us.Warning: you'll need to take several (minimum 3) pieces of bread from the basket the server brings to pick up the yummy salad (like everything besides the soup and dessert, it's on one big platter for everyone to eat off - talk about a bonding over food experience!)... but don't fill up on bread. Pace yourself! Next there is a huge "appetizer": flaky philo bread filled with a meat and egg mixture and topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon. This unexpected sweet and savory combination surprisingly works really well, as evidenced by our empty platter. Then the main courses... yes plural! Not one generous dish, but 5. One was couscous topped with a delicious mixture. The lamb was the most tender I've ever had in my life. The 3 chicken dishes were also unbelievably tender and flavorful. My favorite was the apricot glazed chicken. Oh, and the sweet mint tea served hot at the end was incredible!Supposedly there is bellydancing Wednesday-Sunday, but I guess they don't go for very long after 7pm. There was no bellydancer in sight when we went at 8:30 on a Friday. But the servers are dressed up, and they do fun things like a hand-washing ceremony before and after your meal, finishing you off with a spritz of orange blossom water. Our server, who is Moroccan, was awesome and enough entertainment. We just really enjoyed the abundance of delicious food and the unique atmosphere. Glad to have found this gem! We came here late one night after a movie at the Pacific Science Center; they were in the process of wrapping up for the evening, but were more than happy to accommodate a few more persons.Nothing stood out as outstanding, though we all enjoyed our food (and my daughter proclaimed it the best restaurant in the world because she was supposed to eat with her hands!), and had a pleasant time. We'll certainly be back. 1st time having Moroccan food. Surprise dinner for the family to celebrate husbands birthday. Delicious! My 10 and 7 year old even loved it which was a surprise. We had the 5 course meal which was a good sampling of food since we didnt know what to order but it was wayyy too much food for a family of 4. Next time, we'll know what to order and wont have that much left overs. Kids loved the flat crispy chicken stuffed dish..sort of like a baklava. &#160;Did not like the tea at the end though. The belly dancer was ok...kids were entertained. Have come here several times for birthday celebrations. I must say, they have come to be predictably slow. Word to the wise, if you plan to have more than 1 drink, be sure to order your second before you are finished with your first. Otherwise you will sit around being thirsty for quite some time. The food is normally nice, but the staff is barely pleasant. On my last visit here my friends and I tried to split the bill with cards, while another friend would provide cash as the tip after. Before my friend could put their cash down, the waiter stormed over with our receipts asking if this was it. He actually stuck the check in our faces. We had to nicely tell him, that was it for the bill but that we had cash for the rest. So rude! Needless to say his 20% tip went down to 15% after that. If you want nice food, with decent entertainment then this place is OK. Do not go looking for great service. To be quite honest, I'm kind of on the fence with this place. &#160;When we walked in, the decor was beautiful will low overhand ceilings, and ornately designed carpet....so naturally, I instinctively wanted to remove my shoes, but I stopped myself before I did. &#160;While looking at the menu, We were restricted to ordering a feast (which had several courses) or ordering off the a la carte menu. &#160;We were in a party of two, and I was just wanting a light meal, while my dining companion was feeling some pretty sharp pangs of hunger. &#160;Unfortunately, they wouldn't let only one of us order the feast, so we just ordered some cous cous and the kebob. &#160;We washed our hands with a kettle and basin (which I don't know how effective water is for sanitizing), but I suspected that it was more for ambiance than anything else. &#160;The food was good, but not as hot as I would usually suspect. &#160;I'm willing to give this place another chance, but I think I will wait until I'm starving to do so. Came for a birthday dinner. Was excited about the seating. &#160;And then the food came. &#160;It tasted very pedestrian. &#160;And for so many people, they didn't bring enough food. &#160;The poster below who said weird and tasteless was right.Its like it needs to go a step or two further to be a return visit. Right now--no.Plus, hubs and I were sick as dogs the next day. I went there for a birthday dinner and they were very accommodating. We had a reservation and ended up being late, but they were super friendly about it. We had the five course meal which was honestly very mediocre. The food was okay, but for how much food there was, it was very reasonably priced. Service was great and the live belly dancing was another plus. I just wish I had enjoyed their food more. (side note: if I had the option, I would rate as a 3.5 instead of 3) Hmm, my newest experience with Marrakesh is not as good as I had previously remembered it. The food is still delicious, but I feel that the service is a lot slower than before. We came on a Wednesday night to celebrate the first night of Ramadhan. I still love the eggplant in the middle of the salad, the b'stilla royale is still delicious, and of course you can't go wrong with the lentil soup. The entrees looked smaller than before, and I'm not sure if it's because I was really hungry or if it actually reduced in size, but in my previous review I mentioned leftovers and there's no way you're getting leftovers with entrees that we had, unless you got like coucous. If more than one person in your party want rabbit, be prepared to meet with a stern stare because they have a "one rabbit per party" policy. I called in advance and said that we wanted two, so they were able to accomodate that, so call early if you want the rabbit/hare!I would say it's more 3.5 stars than 3, only because the service was super slow and we didn't get refills on water until you ask twice each time. I think they were just understaffed for a weeknight, all the tables were filled. Our server walked so fast, good luck flagging her down, but she was really sweet when she did come to the table. I would just have loved to have a more consistent service. Really good (and good value). Nice ambiance including belly dancer, though the red carpet could use a severe cleaning or replacement. Whatever, just don't look down... &#160;Had lamb m'something with light honey sauce and Ginger and raisins. Suuuuuuper tasty and very tender. Dining companion had tagine of chicken with lemon and olives, wasn't a fan, but I thought it was tasty if slightly dry. Mint tea with dessert was quite good. All in all, replace the carpets and I'll give you a fifth star. Very good food, very authentic, and affordable. Live belly dancers ! I really liked the place, but get a reservation, it gets busy ! Our group of 3 went there on a Monday and we loved it. To echo what other reviewers said, The food is good, the atmostphere is great. Theres something about sitting on the floor and &#160;eating with your hands that seems so right! We didn't get to see any belly dancing being monday. We got to eat the royal feast even though it says 4 or more so we had plenty of food and if your not big on one dish, just wait till you rotate the plates because your gonna love the next dish! Thanks for a great time! The staff is so friendly and informative. We had some Moroccan beer, and it was great. The food and atmosphere was so different, and be prepared to really get to know the people next to you. So much fun. Never saw my boyfriend eat with his hands before and yet he had a good time. This place was great. I needed to take out my wife for her birthday and wanted a small place that would not break the budget. This place has a great atmosphere with authentic looking decor. You are given the choice to sit at low tables with pillows or larger tables with bench seating. For a great price, you are given like 5-6 courses, which include desert, main course, appetizer, drinks and bread. Overall, we had a great experience and I would definitely recommend it to others. I would also love to come back on a night with the bellydancers, as it would seem to be entertaining. Overall a great experience. I was a little off put by the managers suggestion that our large group needed to "be done in 50 minutes because another group was coming in a 8", to which we agreed prior to being seated. Then at 8 the place was empty... the food was good and paired very well with the wine. Everyone received a splash of rosewater and hand washing at the end from the little oompa loompa men. Would definitely go back, but will request a fork next time. Awesome food terrific service! &#160;We had a five course meal including lamb tagine with eggplant! Delicious! &#160;The decor was cozy traditional...we sat on the floor with pillows.. Our waiter wore a traditional Moroccan outfit and took our coats and hung them up and washed our hands with warm water and a towel to dry off...he sprayed rose water on our hands before dessert..so cool and smelled great! &#160;The most amazing experience! We love Marrakesh. &#160;We've eaten here more times than I can count, we've been to parties here, and we've even thrown a party (for 50!) here. &#160;Is this place perfect? &#160;No, nothing ever is. &#160;The seating can get uncomfortable, it can be a tight fit, and some of the new rice dishes are disappointing. &#160;But that said, the core dishes - the soup, salad, pastry, and tagines - are delicious. &#160;I've never left not completely stuffed and unable to eat another bite. &#160;And their prices - $20 for a 5 course meal - are unbeatable. &#160;Is this completely authentic? &#160;No, just like everything else, there are changes, American-izations (come on - are you really against your white server?) &#160;But it's a yummy, fun, enjoyable dinner that I would completely recommend! We really enjoyed this place. &#160;The food was good, and the novelty was even better. &#160;Yes, the waitress/hostess doesn't seem to jive with the atmosphere. &#160;Not being overly familiar with Moroccan food, I would have appreciated a little more guidance as to how to order and what to actually eat with my fingers. &#160;(I love to eat with my fingers.) &#160;But I wouldn't say I found her rude as much as...just...just going thru the motions and getting things done. &#160;So you go in. &#160;If you want to see the belly dancer, show up around 7. &#160;You will be seated at a low table with cushions. &#160;You will be given a hand towel and then asked to hold out your hands over an urn while water is poured over them. &#160;Then you will be given a menu. &#160;Although it is a 5-course meal, you only choose your main entree. &#160;The soup, salad, appetizer, and dessert are standard. &#160;The soup you will drink. &#160;When the bread basket is brought around, be sure to grab a handful, or you may run out while eating the salad/hummus. &#160;I used mine to sop up the last bit of soup as well. &#160;Eat the flaky appetizer thingy (yummy) with your hands. &#160;We were given cutlery to eat the main course, but I don't know whether that's normal. &#160;Our dessert was a yummy, light milk pudding flavored with rose water--a very delightful way to end a big meal.Meanwhile, enjoy the belly dancer. &#160;It may be more fun to go with a larger group so you don't feel singled out when she asks for volunteers to come dance with her.Probably not a regular-haunt type of place, but a really nice way to spend an evening. This place was amazing. The food was great and the belly dancer was truly skilled at work.I would give it 5 stars but the main dish was just okay. The rest of the courses however was amazing:).I am definitely &#160;coming back. I held my fiance's 30th birthday here! Great choice! We had a party of 25 people and that was easily accomodated. The entertainment was great! The food was fantastic and the entire experience went off without a hitch! They even let me come in a few minutes early and set up some balloons, favors. and let me bring and serve a cake!
Ridiculously huge plate of food! &#160;One combo is definitely enough for two people. &#160;The food is fresh, made with love, and is cooked to perfection. Also, the lady behind the counter is a hoot! &#160;I'll be back~
Heftie Heftie Tortie. Happie Happie tummie!After much, okay not much, but some mention of tortas with a fellow yelper, I wanted a TORTA!!! A torta that reminded me of hanging out in the dark streets of Mexico City with friends after a show, enjoying my torta with them and a local transient.Barriga Llena claims the title of the first and only D.F Torteria, but I wouldn't say that's the case. The torta was good, but not a D.F torta.It's not always easy to replicate a food from the motherland, but they do a damn well job.The salsa tasted homemade, and I'm sure the meat tortas were good as well.I'm a veggie, so it was all the veggies, extra avocados and queso Oaxaca for me. The owner charged me 4 bucks, and that's a hell of a deal considering how expensive avocados are.This little shop is decorated with colorful picturesque murals and 7 painted tables, so brightly colored they will clear up Seattle on its gloomiest day. Maybe too overdone, but it does the trick--you'll never forget this place."Una Barriga Llena...no tiene precio." Having a full belly--priceless. &#160;Barriga Llena now takes Visa!I didn't make it up, it was on the menu, along with a map of what seemed to be Mexico City, but all the stops were food items. Creative? No. Tacky? A bit. Don't matter if you can't read spanish, all those roads lead to a Barriga Llena. The owner will explain it.For 4 pesos a torta, and only a mile from mi casa, I'll be back pronto! &#160;I hate it when people substitute english words for spanish ones to cover-up for lack of creativity, and I just pinche did that! &#160;Mierda! Well, it turns out I'm just not a fan of the torta (Mexican sandwich). &#160;I've been meaning to try this place for months and when I found myself in the immediate vicinity, I decided to take the plunge.I ordered the Toluquena, which consists of carne asada, chorizo, lettuce, tomato, and avocado. &#160;Conceptually, this sounds awesome. &#160;But the execution was flawed. &#160;The meat was overly seasoned and somewhat tough and dry. &#160;The veggie toppings seemed tired and on their last legs. The entire sandwich looked and tasted...well, OLD. &#160;Blech! &#160;I won't be back. Horchata and Tortas....a fine combo....errrrp! &#160;*Excuse me!*So this was my first experience with a Torta, and they didn't go easy on me! &#160;This place is small, home-spun, and they basically only speak Spanish. &#160;For the most part my Spanish 1 from high school wasn't quite enough to figure out the menu. &#160;But there is a small "English" cheat sheet, I'm sure it didn't list the entire menu!I tried to order a Combo, which, I believe was suppose to have two kinds of meat, in the end I only got Carne Asada, which was damn tasty, so I was happy. &#160;It was all washed down with a lime Jarritos, it's all goooooooood!!!!!No beer or wine, but they serve up a damn fine Torta, the pickled jalapenos and carrots were solid, as was the home made hot sauce. &#160;Horchata is not to be missed, so said a dining companion, take his word on it.Eat here first and walk down the street to get your drank on! Guess I'm going against the grain on this one.Don't get me wrong. Very friendly service. Bright atmosphere with a painted mural that reminded me of my time in Mexico. And I like the color yellow- its just a happy color. :) Here comes the BUT.. the tortas weren't the winners I thought it'd be. It's my personal preference though. My first time trying tortas and it wasn't as flavorful as I wanted it to be for its size. It is fairly big. I ate half and packed the rest. It did the job of getting me full, but not completely satisfied...hmmm...tortas just may not be my thing, guess I'm sticking with the taco trucks. I loved the fact that everything was in Spanish. When reading a menu in a foreign tongue I can't help but get excited and a pleasantly nervous, both sensations should be welcomed instincts for legit foodies. The gentleman who appeared to be working the register as well as the stove in the back was kind enough to hand me a menu. Whaddaknow, it had a description of what a Torta was. I bet he saw this Asian guy coming in, probably lost, and figured that he had no idea what he was getting into. Indeed he was spot on.I know one word in Spanish. And I'm convinced that if I were to be thrown into any Spanish speaking territory that I would find my way home, safe and full. That word is Choriqueso. I've had it by itself, I've had it as a fancy expensive entr&#233;e, and I've had it chopped up and stirred in with Easy Mac. And I've got to say, I loved it all. Now I can happily say I've had it in a Torta, along with a bevy of other grilled meats. At first the $8.50 price tag was brow furrowing, but the substantial size of the meal makes it an absolute steal. This place has it right. It is a hole in the wall painted bright yellow... yellow is the color of friendship and happiness- paint it yellow and Yelp will come. &#160;Simple tortas are sold here. Menu is in Spanish but they have a nice little English cheat sheet they will give you. My suggestion is to go with the carne asada and chorizo sandwich, the spiced meat sandwich, or the breaded steak and chorizo sandwich. I have found the beef here flavorful, wonderfully cut, and tender. I was able to finish a whole sandwich without getting grossed out- and I use to be a vegetarian! The sandwiches appear small in size but as you start on your second half you realize they are just right and are very filling. Almost all sandwiches come with avocado, lettuce, tomato, etc. There is chipotle salsa and peppers on the tables to add the heat fact. This place also wins a special place in my heart for the service with a smile, the mural, and the photos that line the walls. Plus- they proudly display their Yelp loves us sticker and their chorizo rocks. You pay after you eat and Jarrittos are available from a cold case- Taramind flavor is random and Guava was surprising not very sweet- a good thing. PS- I have gone twice in one week- the last time I did that was for a ice cream place... This place is special! &#160;AND they have a fun drink that tastes like churros made with "milk' and whatnot- Order it off the board and they will make it- my dining companion taught me this :) I will have to say that I am not a huge fan of the Caribena (pork and pineapple)- but that could be just me and my issues with thick cut chunky fatty pork. Don't even bother coming here alone. &#160;That friggin huge torta is made to be shared, especially if you don't want to go into cardiac arrest from all the meat. &#160;I had the Toluquena, which was the Carne Asada and chorizo specialty. &#160;Everything was seasoned right and the red sauce that comes with the torta is exquisitely flavorful, but mild enough for a statesider to stomach. The Barrigona is one of the biggest sandwiches I have had in a while. Bigger than anything at Lunch Box Lab. Very delicious but wished I had ordered some chili peppers to beef it up some. &#160;I tried the Diabla this past winter and that was worthy too.
We just returned from an outing to Baja Bistro. Based on previous reviews we weren't exactly sure what to expect, and that feeling carried through while pulling up outside of the establishment. There seems to be a bar next door to the restaurant. The bar has a rainbow flag hanging in the window, which left us feeling positive about entering. I'm glad we did.The place has a wall of windows, which to see mid-day probably isn't that spectacular, however to be able to witness a sunset there was really phenomenal. The food was really good! We both had margaritas with our meals and we took advantage of happy hour pricing for those drinks and the kids' meals. My partner had the verde burrito (delicious pork with a kick!) and I had the steak burrito. We also ordered a quesadilla and the chicken nachos. Everything was affordable and there were no complaints about the food quality or taste. We were the only ones there, and I'm not sure why. The service was friendly and fast. We will definitely head back again soon. It's not much to drive past, but I encourage you to go in and check it out for yourself. There are some really great photos on the wall and some other interesting items for folks to look at (masks, etc). The more we discover on beacon hill, the more we are happy we moved here. Pretty good Mexican food. Nice little place, good margaritas. Loud bar next door that shares a connected hall and bathroom. Didn't bother me, but parking was a little difficult. Had the cheese enchilada and it was nothing to write home about. Beans and rice pretty typical norte americano fare. In other words, good but not authentic mexican.
I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews, because I am a big fan of Lemongrass. It's close to work and makes a great lunch spot when I am craving something authentically Vietnamese. It's incredibly affordable and all the waitstaff are great. I have eaten pho all over (including Vietnam) and I think the broth here is actually one of the better ones around. It's sweet enough without using MSG and has a nice balance of savory-salty.These are some of my favorite dishes on their menu:Springs rolls: a nice balance of green lettuce, vermicelli, shrimp, and a crispy wonton thingy that adds a nice crunch. The peanut sauce is just the rice consistency and topped with chopped peanuts.Catfish in a clay pot: delicious braised catfish, tender, flavorful and cooked with chopped scallions and herbs. Great dish to eat with lots of rice to soak up all of that braising liquid.Sweet and sour soup: a nice tangy broth with lots of tomato, lemongrass and large pieces of halibut and prawns. Best spooned over a mound of rice.Bun rieu: tofu and crab floating in a fiery orange seafood broth over vermicelli. I just wish the accompanying bean sprouts and banana blossoms were fresher and more plentiful.All the salads: whatever type of meat you order is cooked to mouthwatering tenderness and served with a perfectly balanced dressing, and lots of fresh lettuce, cabbage, beefsteak tomato slices, and cilantro. I've been here before and had a much better experience but I had to share my most recent experience because I am just shocked at the lack of customer service. I went in on a weekday night, just to pick up two Bahn Mi sandwiches, made the exact same, and the only wrench I threw was NO JALAPENOS as I am your classic white girl. The place was not busy at all, they maybe had 3 tables in the whole place? And there were about 4 different women working those tables. Anyway, they very rudely told me to sit and wait for a couple minutes so I did. But it wasn't a couple minutes, it was 15 minutes before they even offered me water. Then an additional 15 as I saw the guy who came in and order to go after me (no he did not call in) leave with his much more complicated order. So finally I got my sandwiches and got the HELL out, only to find an ABUNDANCE of jalapenos on both sandwiches. Good God, are you kidding me? There was no way I was going back in there to wait another half hour for them to remake it without them. So next time I will go down the street to the MUCH more considerate and kind people at Ginger Lime.Bad service, inconsistent, don't pay attention to your order. DON'T GO! Not to be confused with the other Lemongrass on Jackson - had a fun little conversation with the other Lemongrass today with someone who really didn't speak English. &#160;All in all, I'm on the fence. &#160;I LOVE their 5-spice chicken noodle soup and it's something I will specifically crave. &#160;It's the tastiest, almost salt &amp; pepper type of chicken (can never finish all of it sadly) in a simple broth with egg or rice noodles, bok choy, onions and garlic. &#160;And I really like their Lemongrass tea. &#160;However, the service can be SO slow. &#160;I called in an order today and let me just say this will not be my go-to takeout place. &#160;They were glacial slow at running my credit card and I saw at least 5 tables waiting for their check or having to get up and check on their bill. &#160;I've had the same experience when dining in, so don't be shy if you're waiting or you might just sit there forever.....it's funny because it's such a small place and there are usually a few people working, so I don't get it. &#160;They also stopped serving bubble tea, small tear. The Lemongrass is a good spot to get your Vietnamese food fix. &#160;The food is super tasty and reasonably priced. &#160;The grilled shrimp is pretty much the perfect combo of shrimp, vegetables, and pineapple. &#160;However it doesn't come with rice, that is extra. &#160;The next time I had the five spice chicken noodle soup. &#160;This was amazing! &#160;If only all chicken noodle soup was like this. &#160;The chicken was so flavorful and I couldn't stop eating even after I was full.Definitely order a lychee mojito if you're looking for a cocktail. &#160;It's garnished with two fresh lychees, and there are chunks of lychee in the drink. &#160;They even give you a long spoon so that you can spoon them out to eat. &#160;I was in lychee cocktail heaven. Have had:Vietnamese coffee - can't go wrong w this Spring rolls - fresh ..but honestly have had better  &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; wish they had non - shrimp ones Well done beef pho -i now know not to get pho hereVermicelli w beef &amp; eggrolls - refreshing! Service is spotty. The first time i went, the waitress was a bit lifeless, but still attentive enough to do her job well in a timely fashionThe second time, she took HELLA long to take our order &amp; she meased up te order Also hygene issues...a few friends of mine have gotten their food w hair on their food!!It can get crowded real fast so sometimes its goood to call ahead for togosIm still going to cont going to this place once in a while. How lucky are the Seattle University students to have such an exceptional Vietnamese restaurant in their neighborhood. &#160;We are having a good time working our way though the menu. &#160;Some stand outs are the: &#160;Lemon Garlic Beef, Ha Noi Vermicelli Rice Noodle and the Da Nang Pork Satay. &#160;The flavors are rich and fresh. &#160;It's a peaceful environment with very kind and efficient wait staff. Note: &#160;Some of the dishes may take a bit of extra time to prepare, but its definitely worth the wait. &#160;I'm glad to hear they will be moving two blocks to the north. &#160;It's a much safer neighborhood. Great place for lunch across from the SU campus. &#160;Also have eaten their for an occasional dinner for about $2 more per dish. &#160;My favorites are the Lemon Garlic Beef and Vermicelli Bowl with pork. &#160;Also nice spring rolls. &#160;We have brought a large group here for a luncheon and they were able to accommodate us (we had an advance reservation) without closing down the restaurant just for us. &#160;I was told they will be moving from their current location (12th &amp; Barclay Court) 2 blocks north (in the Douglas) in a few months. Lemongrass is a perfect place to eat some really authentic Vietnamese food. Everything I've ordered has been well prepared, nicely presented and priced just right.. Beer is just $3.50 BAM! Thanks Lemongrass! Best tofu spring rolls ever...service is ehhhh so-so but they have really yummy food. More like 3.5 &#160;starsWe tried the chicken curry which was seemingly none other than chicken thigh soaked in boxed curry with large pieces of broccoli with TONS of onion and peanuts so that was one downside. Another was that the place was really dusty and there were particles in our drinking water.Pros: salads (beef cucumber and the mango salad) are AWESOME, must try good lunch place
I haven't been to The Lemongrass in years but I really liked it when we used to live on 12th. We felt like we'd discovered a secret place that was never crowded and served yummy food at cheap-ish prices! However, I also remember not getting quite what I ordered at least once. And I haven't been back since we moved, so I guess it wasn't *that* great. I'd still recommend it though if you live in the area and don't want to trek to the ID. Don't know what the fuss is about made in other reviews. &#160;Its some pretty bland, slightly overpriced vietnamese food. &#160;I've been there a handful of times now because other people have invited me to go with them, but everytime I do I wish I hadn't. &#160;Even their pho is not as good as I've had at several other places. &#160;Their entrees will run you about 10 bucks, and you won't get very good service either. &#160;My advice: go to Ginger Lime a few blocks down at 12th and Columbia! &#160;They will get your menus, drinks, and food to you right quick, it will be delicious, and you will like the prices. I stopped in here for a quick bite on the way to a Taiko drum concert at SU. &#160;Lovely Bahn Mi sandwiches. &#160;Fresh, lightly crusty French rolls (not so crusty that the act of biting into them would squeeze the filling out all over you!), the freshest ingredients, etc., create a symphony of flavour in your mouth that would makes you wonder why anyone would settle for a mundane burger when there is usually a decent Bahn Mi shop nearby.Good quick service, too; check them out! Mmmm, yummy. Lemongrass is nothing special to look at from the outside (and really from the inside either), but the food here is tasty. My Vietnamese friend took me here (in an effort to avoid the craziness of The Tamarind Tree) last weekend, and everyone in our group really enjoyed the food. The shrimp and beef crepe was awesome, along with the fresh spring rolls and sauteed, saucy, chicken dish served on a cast iron skillet (no idea what the name was but it was great!) I would recommend this place to anyone looking to sit down, grab a quick bite that's not super expensive, and be on their way without a fuss. My family has been going to this restaurant for many years. &#160;Even my Vietnamese mother, who is consistently hypercritical of all other Vietnamese cooking besides her own (and rightfully so!) and my brother, who is a super picky eater, likes to go here.The food isn't the best Vietnamese restaurant food we've had, but it is fairly consistent. &#160;Some of the usuals our family gets is the lemongrass tofu (lots of veggies and great textures), the bo luc lac (although recently the meat was a little too chewy and the sauce was too salty), and the deep fried catfish (the nuoc mam with ginger sauce is SOOO yums!). &#160;Some dishes to avoid: canh chua is a little too sweet and the pho is overly priced compared to other Vietnamese restaurants.There is a small parking lot in the back of the restaurant but there is plenty of street parking surrounding the restaurant as well. We will be back :) Don't be lazy fellow yelper. Just press on the gas peddle a little longer and you can make it to the International District where MUCH better Vietnamese food and service await you..... This place has excellent pho in my opinion. The broth is perfect. Good (and cheap - $4) bahn mi sandwiches as well. Have tried a few other dishes and wasn't that impressed (although the shrimp curry was good), but that hot tasty bowl of veggies keeps me comin' back. Very speedy service. Went to Lemongrass for lunch today. I'm disappointed in the food. I ordered vietnamese dry noodle, the noodle was way too salty, I order egg noodle version. But the noodle they used seemed like it was the kind they use for fried noodle kind and not the egg noodle kind that is usually used for soup noodles. I'm surprised that they have so many different verities of salad rolls which was nice and that tasted ok not bad. I tried to order other appetizers but they don't make it anymore or was out. Also noticed that a lot of the items on the menu was crossed out. All in all I don't think I will ever go back there again. This place's food is getting worse, I went here about 3 times total over the last couple years, the most recent time I went the flavors are getting very plain. &#160;This is definitely not an authentic Vietnamese restaurant, most of the guests are non asians so you can guess how the food taste. &#160;I wouldn't come back after my last visit. it was good, but for some reason the bun wasn't as good as i've had at other places. &#160;the salad we shared was better i thought. &#160;it was supposed to be rare beef, but then it was cooked. &#160;i had been meaning to try this place for a while. &#160;seems like i have been driving by this place for years, but i had too much momentum going to a different destination to stop and try it. &#160;and then i would forget about it. &#160;good thing my companion had the idea to go. For the most part, I come to Lemongrass for the pho and spring rolls. Yes, I know there are many other pho places close by, but there's just something about being able to walk into a restaurant that's far from crowded with fast service that I enjoy. It is a bit more pricey than other Vietnamese places, but if you're in the area...try it out.
Lemongrass is not the best... I LOVE Gingerlime and I think this is extremely sub par compared to Gingerlime. First of all... The service sucked. The waitress would walk away before we could even really order and they messed up our order at least three times. After the long wait and irritating service I was expecting really good food... unfortunately it was just kind of Blahh. Too oily and not flavorful enough. Very one dimensional. What I mean is Chicken was just chicken with sauce on it. Give me some cilantro, mint, peanuts... something? Spice it up a bit? I might have high standards because gingerlime has spoiled me so much, but this place did not leave me satisfied and sorry to say Lemongrass, I won't be coming back.Needs better service and better food! Not so good eats. They have some really tasty dishes here. &#160;I don't think I've had deep fried tofu quite like that - not as firm, so you had some nice morsels inside the light breading.Most of the other food was pretty solid. &#160;Tasty, but nothing that really stood out as heads above other Vietnamese food. My boyfriend and I have been here twice. We've ordered mostly vegetarian (or almost) items like chili paste tofu, lemongrass tofu, veggie pho (they put *lots* of varied veggies in the veggie pho! I was so pleased), tofu rolls, etc. Everything has been very tasty and with good quality -- the quantity and quality of the vegetables in particular. It's a common problem to see very few good veggies in some food (or only token amounts). The service is sometimes a little bit harried (server at the table and gone, sometimes too soon) but that isn't really a problem. The prices are also incredibly good for the price.
I guess I don't live in a vacuum . . .the experience of "the two faces of The Red Door" seems universal. &#160;Yet unlike the low-star reviewers, I'm here to sing the praises of this Fremont classic. &#160;Last sunny Saturday afternoon we cruised-in around 4 PM, cozied up to the bar, enjoyed delicious Bloody Mary's, their great beer selection &amp; a fun chat w/ other patrons. &#160;The Blue Cheese Burger always pleases (I often bacon-it-up), and a friend loves the steamer clams. &#160;Big Plus: I asked for water as my afternoon buzz threatened to outpace me, and the friendly bartender refilled my glass over and over with a big smile (I HATE beggin' for water!).We left shortly before 7 PM with a good buzz. &#160;This a great bar, and all this negativity due to the Fri/Sat late night patrons is unfair. &#160; Just enjoy The Red Door when all the youngun's aren't there - - weeknights or week-end afternoons. &#160;Seattle has plenty of great places for Fri-Sat night - - as Fri/Sat night progresses have the sense your mama gave you to take your cuteness to some other bar you love . :-) &#160; And for you twenty-somethings, I have drank here on a Saturday night when you are here.......please either grow up or phone your mama for a primer on m-a-n-n-e-r-s. sorry did I just walk into a fraternity and sorority reunion? And am I the only girl not shit faced!!!!! WTF did you just ask me if I am tall enough to be here!? Wow really? ----- yes my friends even i felt out of place --- maybe this really isnt my scene, and maybe just maybe it was the night that i went here..... But fuck really ???!! Totally not my scene anymore and maybe with more shots of patron and some sedatives i would have had a better time but where i am in my life and my choices that i am going to make this place is not where i would like to see myself regretting them in lol.... This place to me is like another amber with new 21 year olds and out of towners that want to go buck wild at lol.... Weeknights: Great!Weekends: Not worth the trouble.I wish I could trade the Red Door in for a Matador or a Bal Mar. Fremont needs a place with pool tables and/or small plates thats a little more upscale. A place with no covers, plenty of seating and consistently good food and drink. I'm going to try to keep an open mind and not be too harsh on the Door. It's not even fair to compare it to the original Red Door, it's a completely different bar now. If you go on a weeknight its not bad, just be sure to avoid the Friday/Saturday crowd, unless you're in the market for a 'rack' of lamb or some pork 'sausage'. &#160;The owners and staff are cool when they're not having to deal with the meathead crowds, the food is decent and they have a good selection of beers and booze. Went back last night with a fun group and had a good time. In honor of Van Halen being in town the bartender played their 1978 classic Van Halen. That in itself earns them a 3rd star. L A M EThis is how the reddoor gets it patrons:a) Hey guys I just turned 21 (or I just got a fake id) lets go drinking.b) Yeah man that is sweet I know just the placea) Oh really what is it?b) The mother frickinnnnnn Reeeeeeedddddd Dooooooora) awesome!2 years go by with these frat dudes hanging out there then they wise up and go someplace that doesn't suck.So there are 2 reasons to go here:1) you are an idiot and don't know better.2) you are a woman and want free drinks. &#160;aka teach the people in catagory 1 a leason. We go as a group of girls to have fun. Some of us have pretty serious boyfriends and like going on a excursion to the Red Door once in a while. We make sure we sit at the bar and not the part by the door- drafty and not fun. This placement has yielded, on two separate occasions, plates of fries and free drinks from both the bartender and gentlemen. The giving of the items has always been in a low-key way and makes us smile. We usually talk to many different types of people and have many laughs. We are not there to be picked up or pick up on anyone so it makes the whole situation just innocent. The bartender are quick with drink orders and have local and divey beers on tap. The covered and semi heated outside can be a fun location once in a while when out with a multi gender group. I always seem to run into people from high school here- which can be weird or nice. In the summer, the girls do start to dress a little showy and the crowd changes a bit. In the winter, there seems to be all ages and people willing to talk to each other- unlike other bars in the area. If you feel like being social go the Red Door. The Red Door is very Jeckle and Hyde.... To see it at lunchtime with the daylight flooding in and people relaxed enjoying grub it is difficult to imagine what happens when the sun goes down Fri-Sat. Fantastic space with exposed brick, ample seating and a beautiful bar. The bar is well stocked and the food is pretty good. A perfect stop for large groups. At least that's what a weekday looks like....Go on the weekend and it's the cr@ppiest frat party you can imagine. You won't get a glimpse of the setup because you'll be too busy being pushed through the crowd coming and going to the bar/bathroom/etc. Bathroom (ladies anyway) is invariable slick with vomit or some other mess. The crowd is over-run with frat boy homies picking fights and drunk belligerent &#160;girls who are only upright because the crowd is so packed. :| It's not management's fault they've ended up a meat-market on the weekend. They did a lot of things right in fact. It may have just followed (and fallen to) the demographic shift that has been happening in Fremont the last few years.I admit that I've ended up here at the end of many good nights in Fremont.... but the weekend crowd has a way of shoving, shouting, and bumping (and occasionally grinding) sense into me that it just isn't my scene. Reading over some of the other reviews for the Red Door, it seems like you could figure out that you should go there on a weekend night if you're looking for a frat party and any other time if you want a good meal. &#160;So I won't spend time talking about the dual personality of the Red Door and instead, here's what *I* love about it:-Hearty, basic, good bar food. &#160;Unlike many bars in Seattle, this place doesn't try to class itself up - you go here for a beer and a really solid fill-in-the-blank BBQ or grilled sandwich. &#160;And it's solidly delicious.-Both cider and Guinness on tap while not serving Irish food.-The fries are awesome, and I can't think of many other places in Seattle you can get them served with chili and grated cheese (clutch in good chili-cheese fries.-Larger groups can almost always get a table without any wait at all if arriving before nine or ten.-The outside patio. &#160;It's friggin sweet when it's warm enough.-Conveniently located for starting a bar crawl in Fremont.
I pretty much missed the whole college bar/singles scene. Right before I turned 21, I met my now husband, and for whatever reason, we just didn't feel it necessary to spend our nights getting shitfaced down at the local tavern. On occasion, a friend and I would pop into the restaurant/bar where my then boyfriend worked as sous chef for 5 years to enjoy a free drink and watch the college cuties get hit on by Neanderthal fratties. For the most part, I always counted my lucky stars to have found "the one" so early on. Being at Red Door reminded me of that scene. Girls wearing those hideous formal shorts with heels, looking around the crowded room for someone better to walk in. Guys in t-shirts featuring ironic phrases checking out the girls, trying their darndest to get a piece of the action. &#160;It's a strange mating ritual, the one that takes place in a mostly college-aged bar, and while enjoying a beer with friends, we witnessed more than one girl getting felt up by some cretin guy. Why anyone over the age of 22 would want to spend time in a place like Red Door on a Friday night is beyond me, and so after one beer each, we high tailed our late-twenties, married asses out of there.And if our ages weren't reason enough to not be there, the fact that they were playing butchered dance mix versions of great '80s songs was another. Blasphemous! This would be an okay place if not for the people.I see what people mean about Freemont now. &#160;They should put a subtitle under the title saying "raise the sorority house red lantern. &#160;It's your lucky night."I think the cool server we had for our steamed muscles and beers had it right when she said that it's cool during the week, but on weekends it's all fratboys.I looked around. &#160;I saw some of the caricatured fratboys in the vertical stripy shirts, and two groups of hunted-looking women/girls (they looked 12 to me.) &#160;There were several other stereotypes in here as well. &#160;There was the old-man-in-the-club.There was a couple of vamps looking to get their boyfriends to start a fight. &#160;There was some dude with a huge gold pendant that looked like he stepped off of the set of Enter the Dragon.Weird weird group. &#160;Like a bizarrofrat mixer.There is a little hidden room in the back behind the kitchen that looks like a fun place to hang out, but if anyone of your group is a girl, expect the frat crew in your face in no time.So think of it this way. &#160;It's a clean and nice place in the downtime, and on weekends it is toolbox central. The clientele consists of fresh 21 year olds and sleazy douchebags looking to score.Watch your step on the sidewalks in the vicinity of the Red Door, its like a vomit mine field on Saturday and Sunday mornings.Simply put, one of the many reasons why "Fremont Sucks Even More Now." I stopped here for lunch one weekend and was very disappointed. The bar tender ignored me for about 15 minutes before he asked what I wanted to drink. It took another 10 minutes to get a menu and another 15 for him to take my order. Now... if the place was busy I could forgive him, but in this case he was just too busy chatting up the regulars at the other end of the bar. He was friendly enough and the food was good, I just hate being ignored. this was actually my first introduction to the bar scene in seattle and ever since ive always had a slight affinity for this place. it isnt necessarily high on my list of joints to go for a beer. but when i find myself in the area, its the place im most familiar and comfortable with stopping by for a red hook and a fish and chips.ah the fish and chips. very very tasty at this place and at around 9 bucks, very affordable and quality for the price. they dont do that smooth breading style (the kind that looks like frozen fish fillets/hockey pucks) its very crunchy and thick, i like it that way. the atmosphere is laid back and unpretentious. just your everyday dockside pub/restaurant. the inside has a very warm and inviting bar to belly up to and a number of casual tables and booths for small groups of friends around it. it also has a nice deck overlooking the ballard ship canal which is a great place to sit and watch the boats float by. the service has always been great and the happy hour specials are decent. the crowd is a mix of young and old, neighborhoodies and passers through. ive never been on a weekend night but i can only assume its like other places in the area (ahem, douchy) from all of the cabbers and weekenders. again, this isnt a place i would go out of my way to stop by, but when im in the area or entertaining friends during happy hour, its a very safe, middle of the road establishment that will give you your moneys worth without the unnecessary dose of douchiness. This place is alright, but nothing spectacular. &#160;It's packed at night on the weekends, and becomes just like any other loud sorta trendy bar. &#160;The ambiance is a step above a sports bar, but certainly could be more interesting. &#160;They have a room set aside with some lit glass tables that are kind of cool, but that's where the originality ends. &#160;My main issue with the place is that I have eaten here three times, and have been disappointed with each experience. &#160;The last time it was the turkey sandwich. &#160;You know you wouldn't think a turkey sandwich wouldn't be all that hard, but I was not impressed. &#160;The meat itself tasted like lunch meat (which it likely was). &#160;The menu said there would be avocado on it and made no mention of onions. &#160;They had quacamole and onions on it. &#160;Annoying, guacamole has avocado in it, but it is way better to just have some slices of avocado than guac. &#160;And I hate onions... if you make it a point to indicate that there are tomatoes, lettuce, and mayo on a sandwich, why not let us know there are onions? &#160;I barely touched the thing and the waitress didn't seem to notice or care. &#160;And there you have it. I almost always have fun here. I come at night for drinks. I come with friends. If I'm inside I have to have a table because it can get really crowded and hot. They have a great outdoor area which in the winter has this tarp window type deal to keep the heat in (they have heat lamps). The outdoor area has a bar! YAY! In all fareness, I will start by saying that I've never been there except for on a weekend nite. They could be great during a weekday, but man, its horrible when I go!!! SOOO packed with post college peeps that just moved straight up from Tommys to here. &#160;You cant even move...... let alone get to the bar, catch the attention of a bartender, get a drink AND THEN move with the drink. &#160;Once again, maybe theyre great and I should give em a try for lunch. Great quantities of recent college-grad horny peeps...That's about it. &#160;=)A little more class would be nice...
Yummmmmmmmmmmm. &#160;I love this place. &#160;All of their baked goods are soooo good. &#160; I don't drink coffee and haven't had lunch here, so can't comment on those points, but all of their breads/pastries/muffins/cakes are so delicious. &#160;I especially love their morning glory bun. &#160;The carrots and zucchini in it make me *feel* like I'm eating something healthy, but it is so tasty. &#160;The prices are fitting for the quality of the goods and the service is super friendly. &#160;One note though - the parking situation is kind of weird. &#160;I know that the parking on street is free, but I'm not sure about the lot to it. &#160;It seems to be a paid parking lot, but then there are reserved spots next to the building, but I'm not sure who the reserved spots are for? &#160;I'll admit, I've run in and out and just parked there anyway... hmmm.... Macrina is my favorite brunch spot (Belltown), but the SODO location is nicer and more spacious than Belltown's tiny cafe. SODO location is very airy and tall-ceilinged with plenty of tables. Prices are reasonable, always love the weekly market and brunch specials with unique ingredients. Service was fast &amp; friendly. Ample street parking in SODO. Love the place and the food!!! Ppl are very nice and helpful. I was on my way to Dick's restaurant supply, and this stopped me in my tracks. The ladies at the register were really helpful and cheerful. I had a Rocket muffin.. It was a pretty good muffin, it had a lot of flavors going on. Maybe that's where the "rocket" portion of its name came from? Haha! I want to come here again for lunch, and when i have a bigger appetite! It was a nice spot and I really liked the huge windows and the seating. Hands down my favorite bakery. I'm not big on sweets, so I can't comment there, but the bread is amazing and not over priced like some urban bakeries that don't hold a candle to Macrina.
I'll get to how our lunch was in just a sec. &#160;But first I want to marvel at all the goodies they sell in the outdoor Sunday market in front as well as inside the restaurant. &#160;Inside Huong Binh every square centimeter of counter space is taken up by huge glass jars filled with a variety of treats, including a multitude of candies and even mango with chili. &#160;Plenty of bakery items too.My friend Elizabeth and I were pleasantly surprised at the discovery of the Ding How underground garage, because all parking up top was taken.When we arrived, the restaurant was about half filled. &#160;Based on Elizabeth's recommendation we each ordered a noodle combination plate ($9.50). &#160;I also ordered the Vietnamese Ham ($2.75) as a side. The Vietnamese Ham looked like sausage and was delicious! &#160;And for the price, I thought the portion was quite generous.In addition to the vermicelli noodles topped with a little garnish of peanut and finely sliced green onion, our combo plates had beef, pork and shrimp kebobs and a dipping sauce. &#160;In addition, there was a shrimp "lollipop" (ground shrimp mounted on a stick of sugar cane). &#160;And on the side of the plate was a huge mound of lettuce leaves to make "sandwiches" with the other fixins'. &#160;This reminded me of the do-it-yourself chicken lettuce wraps at P.F. Changs. &#160;In a nutshell, everything on the combo plate was tasty. &#160;They do a real nice job here in how they season their meats. &#160;Like with the appetizer, the combination plate portions were very generous.After eating, we ordered hot Vietnamese coffee, which was excellent. &#160;They give you a little mug with condensed milk on the bottom. &#160;Sitting atop the mug is a miniature "French Press" of a sort which drips the coffee down onto the condensed milk. &#160;Note that it does take a while for the coffee to finish dripping, but is well worth the wait. &#160; We had a leisurely lunch, probably staying here almost two hours.Service was interesting. &#160;I think their philosophy may be to just leave you alone while you eat, but because the servers are always around, you can ask for something without any trouble. &#160;They don't bring your check to the table, you just go to the counter and pay. &#160;Cash only! I usually come to houng binh when I'm craving rice. I use to come here a lot but one night my friend and I came in for dinner twenty minutes before the restaurant closes and as we walk in they said they were closed. We were kind of mad because technically they don't close until eight o'clock. So if you decide to come here come at least an hour before they close or you'll just waste your time driving there to note, not better than green leaf but still good. it's gone down a little bit since my review in 2008 but still good. Green Leaf, I am so over you! Huong Binh has won me over after a fantastic lunch today. The prices are reasonable and the menu extensive for quality, authentic Vietnamese food. If you are looking for pho, they don't have it here. But they do have Bun Bo Hue, a pho cousin that is even better. I ordered a vermicelli platter with grilled pork and grilled shrimp. They were cooked to perfection and seasoned well. I loved wrapping the meat, noodles, and herbs in a lettuce leaf and dipping it in fish sauce! I didn't even care that I was being messy with nuoc mam and ground peanuts dripping from my chin and hand....it is so worth it. I believe it was only $7.95, and that is just a great price for the portion and the quality of food. Also, we had very friendly service and did not experience any problems. I can't wait to take my hubby here...he can eat with his hands and be messy and I won't be embarrassed!
I had the Famous Grilled Pork on the "intricately tied" thin noodles. The whole dish was delicious. The dish was accompanied by a subset of the array of random herbs that you'd find in Vietnam, but was a tasty addition regardless. &#160;We both tried the deep fried sugar cane, which was difficult to eat, mostly because it is an entire, thick piece of sugar cane. No one has masseter muscles burly enough to get through en entire piece of sugarcane; you have to go at it at an angle, which is hard to do when you're holding a scalding hot item with chopsticks. I think that if they had sliced it a few times lengthwise it would have helped. In any case, the service was friendly enough, the ca phe sua da was potent, and the food was tasty. I'll return! There are only 2 things I come here for. The first is the "Com Huong Binh" (broken rice dish with the charbroiled meat, meatballs, shrimp cake...) and the "Banh hoi chao tom" (vermicelli served with 2 grilled shrimp paste on sugar cane) or "Banh hoi tap cam" (vermicelli served with charbroiled meat, meatballs, shrimp paste...for $1 more) Portion-wise, the "banh hoi chao tom" is pretty small compared to the other two dishes I mentioned. I've been here for over 10+ years now and I swear the portion just slowly gets smaller. Either that or I'm just getting fatter. As others have mentioned, they have lots of imported snacks and goodies here. Displayed outside (near the ice cream freezer) and inside (near the cash register)..and even hung on the ceilings (cool Vietnamese lanterns)..this place is practically half restaurant, half grocery store... As a fair warning though -- most of these items are way over-priced. Similar/exact goodies can be found at any other grocery store around the area for much cheaper. FINALLY!!!!!!!! REAL AUTHENTIC BUN BO HUE!!!!!!Hahahhaa, I had to try their Bun Bo Hue b/c I hear it is the best in Seattle.Honestly, I've tried so many BBH, that I can't tell who's the best anymore. But let me say, the BBH was sooo goood. Mmm the fish cakes or crab cakes in the broth was to die for! Oh sooo good! The broth was just on point, how I like it. I didn't have to add anything in it! LOL. And I LOVE how they serve REAL vietnamese food. NO PHO! :)I am planning on coming back to try their other rice dishes and noodle dishes. OMG!!!! I love it.PS. They only take cash :/ I've been going to Huong Binh for about ten years now, and I'm definitely a fan.My favorite order here is the banh uot chao tom in a bowl, aka shrimp on sugarcane with rice roll, peanuts, veggies and a side of some wonderful fishy sauce. The shrimp paste wrapped around the sugarcane is juicy and flavorful and the portion is always more than I can finish, and under $10. I also like the pink coconut drink with jellies in it (che thai!!), mmmm!Service here is great, the complimentary tea is delicious, there's free underground parking and I like how they sell baked goods and dried fruit and stuff there as well. Huong Binh is easily one of my top five places in Seattle. *CASH/CHECK ONLY* Ever since I was first introduced to HB years ago, we all order one item and one item alone. It used to be the #9, but npe it's the #11. So damn good! You get 3 skewers of charbroiled pork, grilled shrimp, an meatballs (the last of which can be hit or miss). My favorite part of the dish is the shrimp wrapped around a piece of sugar cane. Don't save the best for last and let it get cold--eat it first! What also sets them apart is the entrees with the clear glass noodles with dried shrimp sprinkled on top, and their potent fog sauce.Just remember, it's cash only! Oh and there's parking downstairs, but the entrance ramp is ridiculously steep. If your car is lowered at all, make sure you use the back entrance/exit. I went in there and I got the Lettuce wrap thing with the noodles and meat haha I'm so white washed I know.Decor was cute, it doubling as an asian candy store is also quite cute. My food was totally fantastic, but I'm lucky I was with my vietnamese speaking aunt because our waiter didn't speak english. One of the huge flaws in eating at good Asian restaurants.Otherwise everything is lovely but they did forget my aunt's soda. Cash/check only and me with my asian cheapness feels everything should be 2 dollars less cause I can make everything at home for cheaper. hubby had the bun mung bit (vermicelli with bamboo and chicken)--he thought it was decent so he wanted me to give them credit for it. I had the bun bo hue which was filled with MSG and so NOT spicy. If I had rated only my dish, this place would have gotten a 1 star (one star for having parking). Maybe it's because we're from LA and I'm spoiled with the choices. By far this is the best place to get banh hoi in town! Everything else here is okay, but I mainly just go here for their banh hoi thap cam. They give you a great portion with plenty of herbs and a great variety of meat. I especially enjoy the shrimp wrapped in sugar cane plus the nem nuong meatballs with the banh hoi (delightfully tasty)! This place's food's ok, the only thing I come back here to eat is the Bun dat biet, I like the bbq meat skewers and the shrimp wrap around the sugar cane thinggy, but the service here's not very good. &#160;Most of my friends don't wanna go with me when I ask them to go to this place with me because of the service... so if you have great patient and don't mind some rude service, maybe you can try the vermicelli here. Cash Only...the price and the dishes are very good. &#160;I come here often after work or whenever I'm in the area and have cash. SO GOOD! I only get one thing here and it's the vermecilli bowl with grilled pork, meatballs and shrimp skewers. The bowl comes with a huge serving of noodles, lettuce, bean sprouts and herbs with the skewers on top. I pour the fish sauce mixture all over and demolish the whole thing. It definetely hits the spot everytime. Been here multiple times and i can say the food is pretty much average and the only reason i came back here was my mom's boyfriend wanted to eat here and i had a good feeling that he was going to pay for mine also.:) The food is same but i saw the menu and pretty much everything on the menu have gone up $2 on pretty much on everything. The reason for this was for fresh coat of paint to make it a little more "clean", which is pretty much all the restaurant around i see is doing, maybe trying to copy tamarine tree? I would rather have there crusty look, so i can have a cheap eats. Don't really have a reason to come back here maybe another free meal by mom's boyfriend or maybe try their signature dish that is recommended by my fellow yelpers. Hole in the wall but great food. Their ban hoi was delish. Free parking is a plus.
"What bad customer services?"Ok Ok....as much as I dislike an Asian restaurant that can't treat their customer right because they think it's above them or don't need it, I'm willing to look the other way and feign ignorance just so I can get their rice plate of grilled grilled nem nuong (awesome grilled fermented pork). Actually, anything with grilled meat at this place is pretty darn good.Things to keep in mind:Like any Internal district, parking for this restaurant is a pain, be prepared for some bumper bumping if you're going to park within the lot of this little plaza. Set your expectation for services low. No they will not smile or be friendly. If you're lucky, when you come in, someone will point towards a table, other than that find a seat, take it or just stand confused a few minutes, eventually, someone will want to you stop blocking the restaurant's door. Try not to drop your utensils either, it will be a while before you can get someone's attention and get a replacementThe 4 star purely for grilled meat, anything else, I cannot speak for other food, except the banh cuon and pho which are only mediocre. As far as I'm concern, go here only for grilled meat because everything else is not as good as you hear from your friends and family. So if you're going to order something other than grilled meat, make sure at least, that your dish has some grilled meat because that's about the only thing this place does a good job of cooking. I also like that they give plenty of vegetables. It's not truly a Vietnamese meal if it lacks vegetables. After your meal, go up to the counter to pay, again, let I remind you that service expectation should be low. They will provide you with a bill but you need to get your butt up to the cash register to pay. Again, do not expect them to smile at you when you do so. When leaving, don't forget to buy the all the junk food and goodies they have in front of the restaurant. This is something that's truly unique and one of a kind for this restaurant. They have random junk food at the cash register and outside in front of the restaurant. Salted mangoes in chili, dried plumbs, seeds, Asian candies, and other hmmm...I'm kinda curious and want to try this stuff....Don't worry because it's placed outside of the restaurant, someone will come and serve you because they fear you'll try to eat some without paying. This place, the food is good enough that I've been coming back....sometimes I wonder why....But it is convenient because there are other restaurants near by if I change my mind, my parents like it here, and if I'm not in the mood for poor services, there are other restaurants near-by. There is also a deli nearby if I'm not completely full, but you should be plenty full with the portion from this place. Hmmmm...now I want some grilled meat! My favorite restaurant in International District. They have the best banh hoi thit nuong and bun rieu chua. Their portions and prices changed with the new management. Still the best food I have had outside of Orange County.If you go, I recommend going on weekdays. They have unique dishes only offered on weekends or weekdays. I think their weekday dishes are fantastic. My favorite is bun rieu. Very difficult to find a place that offers it on the menu. Very few Vietnamese restaurants offer it, hence why I frequent here a lot. It is worth the drive from Everett!
I stopped by this new place for the first time a couple of weeks ago while driving to Northgate mall. It is a tiny little store front in a strip mall, but do not be put off by the exterior. It is clearly a family owned business, and I was told the chef just moved here from Thailand. The food is delicious- and SO inexpensive! It is flavorful, spicy and completely un-greasy. Everything I have had so far has been great but my fave is the pad see-ew. Also- the food is literally made fresh in 5 mins and you can watch the whole operation in the open kitchen. This was certainly fast, and on their opening day to boot - about 5 mins from placing our order to out the door.Quality was reasonable, considering it was under $20 for an app and 2 entrees. I ordered the cashew chicken with tofu substitute (veggies were plain - green pepper, carrots, onion), wife got the pad siew, and we split an order of egg rolls. Both entrees came with white rice.They packed it up in styrofoam, which I'm certainly not a fan of. Fast and friendly service. Owners are very friendly. The food was great, even our kids loved it. Great addition to the neighborhood. stopped in for lunch before the crowd got there.Had take out the food was comparable to other thai places. &#160;Was still hot when I got it home.Man at the counter was very nice and personable.Will definitely go back agin soon
Meh,I don't know what the fuss is all about. &#160;I didn't have dinner here, just drinks and a few apps. &#160;All together fairly lack luster and had that de ja vu type feeling where I'd been in here before. &#160;For some reason all these Asian Fusion places seem to be cut from the same design cloth. &#160;Although the food wasn't terrible, it just wasn't really exciting. &#160;For the price of drinks and apps, a group of 5 could have eaten at any Chinese restaurant in the ID and got tanked during the meal on great food and drinks. &#160;It's not that I don't appreciate white linen and dimly lit dinning areas! &#160;I just don't feel like shelling out this kind of cash for ambiance instead of quality of food. The greatest thing about Wild Ginger, aside from the fact that it is my favorite restaurant in Seattle, is that for all that foo foo and big plates of masterful food, you don't pay and arm and a leg. Of course your arms and legs may vary, see your banker for details.There's a lot to like about Seattle of course, but quite frankly I find it to be a bit of a bush league San Francisco when it comes to downtown. There are parts of this city that, if you looked at the sidewalk and the bums' feet, you could swear you were on Market St in SF. But all of that disappears when you set foot in Wild Ginger.For a hectic and busy place, the staff are still smiling and courteous. And suddenly you are out of the grit into a stylish world of wonderment. I think perhaps I'm a bit overimpressed with the joint despite the good food because of the contrast with the neighborhood, which isn't exactly scary but is far from quaint. Like a good West Coast restaurant should, Wild Ginger doesn't just serve Asian food, they fuse it. Yes the duck is superb. Anybody that gets duck right is a hero in my book. Plus, they really know their noodles. That's a wonderful thing.The music is cool as are the people. The drinks are fancy and trendy. The whole affair is upbeat and a good place to impress people with your eclectic taste, and not an embarrassment if you are truly a foodie. So you definitely have to do Wild Ginger when you're in Seattle. I do, every time. Comme ci comme ca: Not great, not bad, but okay.It is a good location to take a group of co-workers or your parents or any group of diverse and maybe difficult eaters, as usually everyone can find something that is middle of the road non-offensive and satisfying. Also the price is fairly mid-range so those out of town guests hopefully won't be freaking out about how expensive everything is. Wild Ginger attempts Asian fusion with some success. &#160;While I wasn't overly impressed with the satay items or the spring rolls, I have been thoroughly impressed with the seven flavor beef, the laksa soup and the phad thai. &#160;For dessert, the mango sorbet is heavenly!The service can be a little flaky, depending on the day; it definitely is not consistently great service. &#160;If you want to avoid waiting, call ahead for reservations. Ok, Bostonian/Cantibridgean does Seattle, part 1.Since I am going to be spending a fair share of my time out here forwork, I thought I'd toss in a review or two......although I usually don't go for anything that marks itself as "fusion,"the Asian influences here are very strong, and the modifications classic Asian cuisine are not severe enough to be distracting. The crispy duck that I had was amazing, the sweetness of the traditional Asian sauces blending nicely with the pepper-encrusted skin.....and the bar - excellent. My classic barometer is, of course, the "dirty vodka martini." Four olives. Perfect.The waitstaff was sassy and jovial (ok, that means they played along with my bullshit) and ... to top it all off, it wasn't over the top expensive. Why the negative one star? Cuz I have to get on a freakin plane and fly 2500 miles to get here... First off to the reviewer below; if a scallop is better or even equal to an orgasm to you then something is missing from your life!That said, ginger is a very nice choice for asian fusion in Seattle. I went with a group of seven and we had a number of awesome dishes. The pot stickers are freakin delish! I really liked the dungeness crab, wok fried with ginger and scallion! The scallops are also a great choice just not orgasmic. I must say that they had Ivory king salmon on the fresh list and it was so tasty I horded the whole plate to my self (not really)!!! To finish I had the mango sorbet and it was yum! the service is very sharp and our server was able to "advise" us as to what was best as well as to help craft a menu for us that fit every ones tastes. It also has a great bar with skilled barkeeps by the way! A great latenight stop point for those in need of a solid nightcap!The cons are that the place is spendy and there is a classist vibe to the joint, many of the patrons have attitudes that are made apparent! bummer! It is a very "Bellevue" crowd. That keeps it from getting 5 stars out of me. I have only eaten here once--but five stars because they gave me my first foodgasm. You never forget your first. This is when I wish ratings were more than 5 star. I'll even take a half. I heard about this heavenly place and always wanted to go and check it out with a fellow foodie..well my wish was granted yesterday evening, when a friend and I went and we keep oohing and aahing over the wine, appetizers, entrees and desert. His:A:Crab cakesE:. Seven Flavor Beef (Flank steak fragrant with the seven flavors of lemongrass, peanuts, hoisin, chilies, basil, garlic and ginger, quickly dry-fried resulting in complex, intensely flavored beef)D: Chocolate Torte ( A dense flourless torte rich in Belgian chocolate)Mine:A: Pot stickersE: Seared Ahi Tuna with a peanut, garlic, peanut, lemongrass and dill sauce). NOTE: Only thing holding me back from licking the plate clean was that I was in public. D: Mango SorbetExcellent wine list to accompany any dish.I'm thinking of going back there again next week. Food : *****Service : ****Ambience : *****Alcoholic Beverages : *****I'm a sucker for 'fake' asian food. If I were to take one of my Chinese, Thai or Taiwanese friends to this restaurant, they wouldn't appreciate the food. But the pan asian stuff is really to die for. I've eaten here a few times now, and I've had a great experience every time.So, what you *have* to try at this restaurant, is the Mango Mojito. 'Nuff said. Really. I've never had anything quite that delicious. Dear Wild Ginger,Let me start off by saying that I have never had a bad dining experience with you. &#160;I leave pleasantly satisfied every time I visit. &#160;You are by far my favorite place to go close to my work. &#160;(Which should mean a lot considering there are dozens of other great restaurants within a 1/2 mile radius).My all time favorite dish was the Seven Flavor Beef. &#160;Notice that I used the past tense because I have a new favorite (this should not suggest that I don't still absolutely love SFB): Panang Beef Curry has now taken the lead. &#160;Match that with the spring roll appetizer and a spiceberry iced tea (spiceberry is essential) and you have the perfect Thai lunch in Seattle. &#160;(For dinner: please seek cocktail menu to accompany meal). &#160;I have heard that the Seven Elements Soup is also a hit - if that's your style. &#160;In closing WG - thank you for always being so very satisfying. &#160;I love you.Sincerely,Jeanna Excellent spot to dine, even at lunch time. &#160;I was blown away with the new decore, clean and elegantly appointment. &#160;It was nothing like your traditional Thai place, fine dining for the ones that can afford to dine in sytle.I ate the Peasant's Chicken and Saigon Scallops for appetizers, excellent choice. &#160;The lunch was completed with a Lamb Bumbu; the others had great meals too. &#160;The only catch is they have no Thai Iced tea, so "boo hoo" for big fans out there. &#160;Definitely a place to visit, and taste one of Seattle's fine dining. &#160;On the other hand, if you're on the east side (Bellevue) and need "real Thai" food, please stop by Chantanee Restaurant. &#160;It's another emerald in the fine city of Seattle. Heard a lot about it. Had wanted to give it a try and we did. It was pretty... good.... our fav was the lamb appetizer, the least fav was (can't remember the name of the dish) but it was the seared tuna entree w dill. Did not like that. At all. I think it would be a good place to go for weekend lunch, sitting by the big glass windows, while you are in the area. I thought it was too dimly lit for dinner. I wouldn't go back with my hubby just for the food unless we were bringing friends from out-of-town and were in that area since it has a nice atmosphere and convenient location. I went to Wild Ginger over the weekend for a friend's bachelorette party - it can be tough to go out to dinner with 10 girls who have totally different dietary constraints and preferences, but Wild Ginger met all of our needs!Most importantly, our server was awesome. &#160;She was totally attentive and helpful - because it is so hard to order in a large party like this, she offerred to help create a menu within our budget. &#160;And she created a delicious and reasonably priced menu for us! &#160;We had lots of different appetizers including chicken pot stickers and chicken satay and entrees from the 7 seasons beef (I think that's what it's called) to the spicy green beans. &#160;Everything was delicious.And, in particular, the mango daquiris are so tasty - a little sip of tropical heaven... &#160;The decor at Wild Ginger is great - lots of open space with high ceilings. &#160;A great place for a large group or just a couple. If you visit Seattle you just must go to Wild Ginger.I recommend you try...- Saigon scallop- Laksa- Lamp bumba- Dungeness crab- Chinese oolong teahttp://www.wildginger.ne&#8230; By far one of the best Asian restaurants in the country! Service is top of the line and the food is exquisite! Stylishly decorated with 2 bars and the coolest Seattle people all around! I couldn't believe how cheap all the food was taking in consideration the popularity of the place! Anytime I'm in Seattle --- I will visit Wild Ginger...I won't care how much calories I consume, i will keep eating ... It gets my yummy-yum vote! My very good awesome coolest waitress in the whole wide world friend Elena used to work here and on a trip to Seattle she urged us to come in and check out this place. I had heard ramblings about the infamous scallops here, but really, how good could a scallop REALLY be?Well I'll tell ya...Dream if u can a courtyardAn ocean of violets in bloomOh wait, wrong imagery. Okay, dream if you will the happy feeling your mouth gets when a buttery sensation dances across your tongue. Then think about the warmth and palate causing tingle of a perfectly cooked scallop dissolving on your tongue. Then imagine what heroin must be like the first time you do it. Take all of these elements and combine them with the all encompassing feeling of sheer bliss you feel after an orgasm and you have the Wild Ginger scallops. Yes folks, they are that good. &#160;And if you live in Seattle or any of the surrounding communities and haven't been here yet, you are as they say, F*#KING NUTS!Cheers :) My odd story about the restaurant:I called the restaurant to ask if there was a wait and if I should put my name on the list. &#160;The girl on the other end told me that there was no wait at all and, if we came in 10 minutes, there'd be no problem seating us. &#160;To my surprise, when my co-workers and I arrived (about 8 minutes later), the hostess informed us that there'd be a 20 min wait. &#160;Um, what? &#160;We decided to just sit at the bar because we were starving. &#160;The tables were wayyy too close together because we were practially bumping elbows with the people at the table next to us! &#160;The satay was not THAT impressive and neither was their green curry. &#160;Maybe I was just too tired to enjoy the food since everyone else seems to be raving about this place. &#160;I'll consider giving it another chance if I'm ever back in Seattle. Just went out to this place while visiting my friends in Seattle. My Thai friend Ja-ae had recieved a recommendation from a coworker and this was the first time here for everyone in our party. We started off with some Lychee martinis and salmon satay which were both fabulous. We ordered potstickers as well which were completely innocuous and just as completely unimpressive. I ordered the Panang beef entree, and shared some of the Thai-style fried catfish as well. Both were superb, I could have dealt with a little more panang curry sauce as compared with the beef. Everyone at the table loved that we were able to order small portions.Last but not least, I should mention desert. I ordered the chocolate torte and my dining companions got the mango and sticky rice. As delicious as my desert was, I was completely and absolutely impressed by the mango and sticky rice. It was the perfect salty-sweet taste of every desert I had while visiting Thailand--a taste I've never had before in the US. I was back in Ratchaburi Thailand eating salty coconut milk deserts while elderly women asked if they could feel my skin while I looked confused and my friend translated... &#160;My Thai dining companions were in agreement, we were all impressed by this desert and it was the perfect end to an amazing meal. I think all reviews should have an extra column "state of hunger". I mean, you'll think a saltine's delicious if you're starving.Why do I bring this up? Well, I was starving today. Really truly starving. I ate peppermint patties like mad to bring up my blood sugar. Finally, it was time to walk to the restaurant. That brought about more waiting. Waiting for our table, then debating what to order, and finally waiting for our food to arrive. When I finally tasted my first morsel of Wild Ginger food, I thought I was in heaven.Was it the food? Was it the saltine syndrome?Anyway, I thought this place was pretty good. Not sure if I'd come on my own; it was spectacularly expensive. Our lunch meal came out to roughly $30 per person.I took away a star for the overpriced factor. Oh HELL no. Wild Ginger is simply a local version of PF Chang's, with more dated decor and less inventive menu. And no, this is NOT a compliment. As a visitor I hate to be hatin' on venerable Seattle institutions. But really folks, your city has sooo many better restaurants than this - for Asian fusion, for ambiance, for service. Mind you, nothing at Wild Ginger was offensively bad, just disappointly average given its reputation. Yes, its location is convenient, but unless convience is your first and only priority (!) &#160;it's worth the extra effort to seek better food elsewhere. There's lots of fantastic exciting delicious food to be had in this city, it's just ain't at Wild Ginger. I have dreams about this place! &#160;The atmosphere is amazing, one of the most professional and impressive establishments downtown. &#160;The round tables are great for groups and sharing plates but I really like the booths with high backs. &#160;It does "asian fusion" without putting cliche titles on their food. &#160;The waitstaff is well trained and serious about what they do without being stuck up.The items that keep me coming back: 1) Schechuan Green Beans (I would go for these alone)2) Seven flavor beef.3) Fragrant Duck4) Green Curry Chicken5) Mango Sorbet At lunch it's Seven Elements soup all the way and for dinner their Black Pepper Scallops for the win. &#160;If you order the soup I highly suggest wearing the bib provided the curry that's in there is deadly to your clothes trust me I know.If you go in a group I recommend doing family style everyone order something different you all share it will be like a party in your mouth with all the different flavors and textures you'll love it. &#160;Like others have said it's not cheap but in my opinion it's worth every penny. &#160;The atmosphere is great and if you are there for a special occasion or a group when making your reservations request one of the private rooms it will make your experience so much better, the services is always top notch no matter what time of day you're there. This is one time I wish Yelp gave me the opportunity to rate a place differently for the "class" that you get to enjoy a restaurant in -- and believe me, at Wild Ginger, there is a definite class system in play. The plebs have to wait in line to be seated -- even if you have a reservation. Once you are seated, you get perfectly serviceable asian fusion food (there are some stand-out dishes, and some that show flair, but for the most part you could be paying half as much for better food and getting better service to boot.) But oh my god, if you are in a private party in one of their private rooms, it's like chalk and cheese. You are honoured, nay, fawned over. You are served delectable dishes which are supposedly on the main menu that you can enjoy in the masses, but whose preparation is not even close. You have a private waiter who enjoys their job and takes care of you.I've had the privilege of experiencing the private dining, and the disappointment of the main dining room. My recommendation: get your boss to book a group of you for a celebration into a private room, but if you want to go by yourself or on a date go to your local chinese or thai restaurant and save some money! I just remembered reading all the Wild GInger reviews. One thing that would absolutely be part of my last meal on earth: Wild Ginger's Hanoi Tuna. I don't love everything here, but I love the Hanoi Tuna more than almost any other food. Seared disks of medium rare tuna tenderloin dolloped with a thick, silky sauce of goodness, an unconventional sweet / savory concoction I can taste sitting here in my living room drinking a glass of water.I miss the old location, which was more hip and intimate and humming. What's there now? Is it, like, Typhoon or something? Belive me, the first time you showed up there post WG departure, after the new Pan Asian roadshow had pulled up, you were perplexed and not amused. You wandered off, deflated, craving a few skewers of the chef's special satee accompanied by delicate rice cubes &#160;and sweet pickles. And the Hanoi Tuna.mmm mmm. UPDATE: &#160;We attempted a do-over, hoping the experience would be better in the better seating area (not the funeral parlor that faces the side of Benaroya Hall). &#160;To avoid crowds (and the need for reservations), we went early (again), around 5PM on Sunday. &#160;This time, we had a great table. &#160;It may be a little outdated, but the main dining area is still nice. &#160;A lot of wood--kinda northwesty-feeling. &#160;We ordered our standards: &#160;Mandarin Chicken, Seven-flavor Beef. &#160;This time, I added an old favorite: &#160;Emerald Prawns. &#160;I think it was a little too early--the oil probably wasn't hot enough. &#160;The Mandarin Chicken was good, but the batter was a little heavy--like ghetto sweet &amp; sour chicken coating. &#160;The sauce saved it--it's sweet and sour and spicy, all at the same time. &#160;Goodness. &#160;The Seven-flavor Beef was great, as usual. &#160;Indescribable sauce--I don't know what's in it but I could probably swim in it and be happy forever. &#160;The big disappointment was the Emerald Prawns. &#160;Unless I'm confusing it with something else, this dish used to be one of the famous Wild Ginger showstoppers. &#160;In its former life, it was a plate heaped with huge prawns, bathed in chopped garlic, cilantro?. &#160;If there was any discernible "sauce" on the plate, I think it resembled a rough-chop Chinese-style pesto. &#160;The Emerald Prawns are nasty now. &#160;It was a small plate of anemic prawns. &#160;I asked them to go easy on the garlic, which they did...but it looked nothing like the original dish. &#160;No in-your-face chopped herbs, no velveted silky coating on the prawns. &#160;Instead, there was a creepy, chartreuse pureed? sauce on it. &#160;I was so disappointed. &#160;To make matters worse, this tiny plate of sorrow cost something like $25. &#160;I shit you not, I was SHOCKED. &#160;All in all, it was still good, but not good enough for me to add any stars. &#160;Maybe we'll have better luck next time. &#160;But I'll NEVER get those freaking prawns again. &#160;Avoid them at all cost.ORIGINAL REVIEW: &#160;Remember Wild Ginger? &#160;They used to be at the top of the "fusion game"--in fact, in Seattle, they could probably say they pioneered it. &#160;I loved it back then, in their humble digs, across from the parking lot with the brick building emblazoned with a half ocean/half land/massive shamu airbrush mural. &#160;I hated that mural...but I miss that Orginal V1 Wild Ginger...terribly.I've always loved the food, and usually, the service is fantastic. &#160;So why do I sound like I'm about to commit seppuku or burst into tears? &#160;Because WG has lost its mojo. &#160;Yes. &#160;It pains me to say it, but this place is in disrepair and the ambience is so bad, it's practically funereal. &#160;I gave them a couple years at their new location--the longest grace period I could extend--but they've failed. &#160;Miserably.Still love the food, and I'll continue to go there...but it's in a sad, sad state right now. &#160;The mood in there is just pathetic. &#160;Dirty carpets (do we have no Hoki back there? Swiffer? Anything?), chipped paint, dusty floors, and worst of all, those freaking RATTAN chairs--they really need to go. &#160;This place is in desperate need of an overhaul. &#160;Think I'm being too harsh? &#160;Try going there for a late lunch or early dinner, in daylight, and you'll see what I mean. &#160;Get a table streetside (by far, the worst part of the restaurant) and proceed to become suicidally depressed. &#160;You can avoid this easily--by sitting upstairs or in the "main" dining area that's near the entrance and kitchen--that seems to be fine. &#160; &#160;The problem is, I loved their old location so much--they had mahogany floors, and it was more cozy. &#160;Even when it became the black turtleneck Dieter's Dance Party scene, it was still a good time. So here's proof that Seattle's "25 for $25" campaign really does work at luring in new customers to restaurants. &#160;Some coworkers and I decided to go to Wild Ginger, mainly because it had a lunch version of the special (in which 25 local restaurants offer multi-course prix fixe menus for $25). &#160;For $15, we'd get an appetizer, entre, and dessert, and I'd get a chance to try a restaurant that's normally too rich for my blood. &#160;Why not?A strange thing happened once we got there, though. &#160;Perusing the regular menu, we all saw other dishes that jumped out at us, and sounded way better than the kind of blah beef/chicken/seafood option on the special menu. &#160;And, comparing costs, we saw that many of the entrees were $12 or under anyway, meaning we could get that and a dessert and still be around the same $15 price. &#160;Why not?I ended up having the Wild Ginger fragrant duck ($10.50), which consisted of duck spiced with cinnamon and star anise, draped with cilantro and steamed mini-buns that were much like hombow in texture. &#160;The idea is that you take a bun, stuff it with duck chunks, cilantro, and plum sauce, and eat it like a small and very messy sandwich. &#160;It's not dignified, so I wouldn't recommend it for a business lunch or a first date, but it was pretty tasty, as was the cucumber salad that accompanied it. &#160;My dining companions were also pleased with their Yin Yang noodles and duck, although one person had the chicken curry and didn't recommend it --- she said it was bland, even for the spice-wary, and didn't have enough sauce to cover the rice.The service wasn't great here --- we had reservations and still had to wait about ten minutes while they prepared a table in the not-full restaurant. &#160;Given that people coming here for lunch are probably on their lunch break, doesn't it make sense to provide quicker service? &#160;Evidently not, because there was a long, long wait between when we placed our orders and when our food arrived. &#160;I've heard that you get crummy service if you're doing the 25 for $25 special, because you're not spending enough money to be a priority, but we were ordering off the regular lunch menu and still got indifferent service.The restaurant is spacious, tastefully decorated with a vaguely Asian/modern theme, and the atmosphere is pleasant. &#160;And the prices really weren't as high as I'd been dreading --- even for dinner, the most expensive item is $25. &#160;But I doubt I'd go back, at least for lunch, when time is of the essence (it's supposed to be a romantic place for dinner, or so I'm told). &#160;Still, I'm glad I tried it, and I have 25 for $25 to thank, even if I didn't actually order it. Came here with work for a meeting. There were 6 of us and we were being taken out by our client, so they were ready to spend. Service SUCKED. Our waitress came by a few times and just kept doing that exasperated, "it's really busy"....you know what I mean when servers do that - it's not really an apology, more like a "well, you decided to bother me when it was REALLY busy, so you're just going to have to deal or leave". RUDE!Anyway, we ordered a bunch of food, all of which was just pretty ok. Except for the scallops! OMG they were so freakin' good. Get those for sure. Everything else was just a solid "good". I wouldn't go here again unless clients were paying. I don't think the food or the atmosphere really justify the price. This was my first real dinner date venue in Seattle. &#160;I was just beginning my shopping for a new city to live epic journey that, at the end, finished where it began; in Seattle.When I had just arrived in the bar area to wait for a table, my escort left to powder her nose. &#160;A mob of cosmo girls drinking cosmos ambushed me on the couches and were subjected to giggling at my inane smalltalk. &#160;Sadly, since I am a firm believer in the (note: &#160;this may be the only time anyone is likely hear me quote a jock outside of Yogi Berra) quip "Dance with the one that brung you" (Darrell Royal not some pretty hick quoted. &#160;If I ever quote a country bimbo, I will burst into flame and perish with appropriate agony.) I had to bid them good evening when the femme returned.The fusion chow was decent and not nearly as expensive as I was expecting for three courses and a bottle of wine. &#160;I'd even go so far as to call it cheap.The food isn't bad, but the downtown happy hour is pretty fantastic. Great place to take out of town guests. Watch them ooohh and ahhh at Asian-Fusion. The decor is nice and will impress folks from the fly-over states. The food is predictably good, so there will be no unpleasant surprises, but you will be paying for this level of consistency. It's definitely not the cheapest place in town nor is it the best. If you live in Seattle you can throw a rock and find a better cheaper Asian-Fusion restaurant, however if you are from out of town. Head here, you won't regret it. They promise. I went here after work for happy hour on a friday- &#160;quite busy as expected...we got seated by the bar- which just gave us an eagle's eye view to the diners and the food as they passed us by... Martinis are well prepared and several house cocktails to choose from :-) &#160;We ordered different appetizers--from the satay bar selections quite juicy and well marinated in coconut milk, curry and seasonings.or &#160;soy tamarind &#160;marinade ..coconut shrimp- crispy and delicious !!! Probably have a date take me back for dinner ;-) I've worked within a block of Wild Ginger for the last three years, which means fairly regular lunch meetings held in the main dining room, at the satay bar, in the lounge...and I'm almost always pleased with what I order. &#160;Ranked at the top of my list is the Seven Elements Soup--let it be said that I've never been a fan of food that requires a bib, but I'll gladly don the vinyl and tie it with a jaunty bow if it means that I get to dive into a bowl of this delicious green coconut curry soup! &#160;(confession: &#160;I don't even LIKE curry, but the tender chicken, fried noodles and coconut cream won me over the first time I tried it.) &#160;Avoid the phad thai (passable but not exceptional) and spring rolls (bland and sticky), but be sure to order an extra side of their house-made pickles. &#160;Save room for a scoop of either the coconut or the vanilla-blackberry ice cream--light, refreshing and palate-cooling. &#160;Service does continue to be an issue overall--primarily chalked up to dining during the lunch rush. &#160;I've had the best luck when dining with either a large group (table reserved far in advance) or with a single friend at the satay bar. &#160;Or, of course, before 12 and after 1pm. &#160;The staff has been exceedingly careful when I've mentioned food allergies (pan-asian + shellfish allergy = tread carefully!) and I've never encountered rudeness, just distraction. &#160;I trust you'll find the same! So we went here out first night in Seattle this past week. &#160;We were a party of 6, our hosts were my girlfriends sister and her husband (a winemaker in close-by Woodinville). &#160;The latter did most of the wine ordering and apparently, when you make good wine (Matthews Cellars), you get pretty good treatment. &#160;He had the sommelier come over, a few other "wine people" stopped by, needless to say, we drank really well. &#160;Now as far as the food goes, we all thought it was great. &#160;Some of the highlights include, the Saigon Scallops, steamed mussles in a curry/coconut sauce, the Seven Flavored Beef and the sea bass in lettuce leafs. &#160;All the food was marvelous. &#160;Having glanced at some of the other reviews, I can see how it might be a bit daunting but from the way we were treated, I would go back in a heartbeat. &#160;Definitely recommended. I tried the 25 for 25 menu at wild ginger. I had read reviews saying that they treat you like peasants if you order from the 25 for 25 menu, but I did not have this experience. Our waiter was very attentive. I wanted to have a good wine with my meal, and after telling our waiter what type of wine I like he suggested a wine that I loved! I would come back just for that wine! :) The food was pretty good, the portions were fairly small, but we were pretty full at the end. They had this amazing asparagus dish, that I definitely recommend trying. The ambience is very cool, I love the asian motif, and how the chairs make you feel as though you are sitting in some hot asian country with large over head fans, and just relaxing. One of my favorite restaurants in all of Seattle! &#160;I've never had a bad meal here, so don't really worry about what you order -- everything is fantastic. &#160;Atmosphere and service are great and if you have a big group, they have these great large tables that seat 10-11 people. &#160;They even have private rooms if you have a larger party, but you have to book well in advance. The food is definitely not bad, but certainly not as good as many of the authentic Asian restaurants in the nearby International District. Nuff said. I've actually been trying to remember the name of this restaurant for a while, so when I came across it I wanted to write a review. We spent the weekend in Seattle a couple years ago for a pre-yelp yelpie vacation. The room at the W was nice, and all the time we spent wandering around at Pike Place Market was great. We mostly did touristy stuff, but the dinner at Ginger stands out for being both good and not at all kitchy. Its been a while since I've been there, so I won't comment on the particular dishes. We had a good meal and good service, I'll go back again. I went there twice. &#160;The first time I went with a big group of people and the experience was mediocre. &#160;The food was a bit overpriced and the service a bit overly pretentious. &#160;The second time I went was for drinks and dessert only and the experience was far better. &#160;The wait staff around the bar were friendly and even let my husband try several ports before he found one he really liked. &#160;The flourless chocolate cake is to die for. &#160;On average, three stars, but the second time was definitely four. Wild Ginger is a Seattle institution for the foodies in the know. Fusion seems to be the flavor of the month, but few places can perfect it like Wild Ginger. Probably the best bang for your buck - not very expensive at all. Yet this place does not have a cheap reputation. It's like living a caviar lifestyle on a fish &amp; chips budget! The food is great and the ambiance even better. This week I have had a lifelong friend visiting. She has recently been diagnosed with multiple food allergies and is currently on a predominantly gluten-free diet. What most would consider a great limitation has been a wonderful exploration in what is available in Seattle.Right here in our lovely city is Wild Ginger, listed among my friend's research as being friendly to those with gluten sensitivities. To say it is "friendly" is a gross underestimate. Del, our server, bent over backwards and made certain that each meal was suitable to be shared among all. The house soy sauce was substituted for a wheat-free tamari, our catfish was breaded in tapioca flour instead of wheat and was sent back twice (without our knowledge) because the "chefs didn't get the sauce perfect enough", and then given to us on the house in the end because it came to us late. Del's commitment to our meal was legendary, and so memorable I nabbed her business cards to share with my food-sensitive clients.The garlic bok choy we ordered was not too heavy on the garlic, and stir-fried until just crisp-tender. The curry was heavy with coconut and spice, the sauce itself thickly clinging to the vegetables and rice rather than dripping through to the bottom of the plate. My companions eagerly mowed down on Kung-pao chicken and lamb skewers, remarking on the generous flavors of each dish. The complex yet balanced flavor profile of each dish reflects the quality of the chefs and the commitment to fine cuisine Wild Ginger is known for.If you have food-sensitivities or just value damned good service, I highly recommend Wild Ginger downtown. Ask to be served by Del - she certainly won't disappoint - and tell her Aimee at VIBRANCE Nutrition and Fitness sent you. The food here is amazing--definitely one of the best restaurants in Seattle. From the satays and cocktails to the service and atmosphere, Wild Ginger never disappoints. YUM! &#160;I love a restaurant that won't bat an eye when you show up in sneakers. &#160;Well, let me preface that I was visiting Seattle from SF and didn't have time to go back to the hotel to change into my shoes. &#160;Anyways, It should really be about the food (ok, and the drinks) and it was at Wild Ginger. &#160;J and I just showed up without reservations and they found us a table by the bar on the 2nd level. &#160;Our bartender waiter, Paul, was uber friendly. &#160;We warned him that we wanted to try a bunch of things and he guided us superbly. &#160;We ended up with a slew of small plates. &#160;The most expensive dish was the sea bass with mango but it was entirely worth the price. &#160;The fish just MELTED in your mouth. &#160;You must order it. &#160;We also ordered crab cakes, tuna tartare (eaten by the spoonful and wonton chips not needed), and black pepper scallops (a little to salty for my taste). &#160;Drinks were tasty as well. &#160;I thought it was funny that Paul thought the Lychee Martini might be too strong for me, the lush that I am. &#160;It wasn't. &#160;He also treated us to mango jalapeno shots, mango smoothies, and the blackberry swirl ice cream. &#160;All in all, it was a fantastic time. It is a nice restaurant. The food is not bad and the service was good. Although I &#160;went thinking that it was going to be better given its reputation. Their Coconut Crusted Shrimp is to die for! It used to not be on the menu, so you may have to ask for it. Since I'm Asian, I don't usually fall for fine dining asian fusion, but this is the one exception on my list. Two enthusiastically thumbs up!! Went there once when I was up in Seattle...not only is the food great but the decor is awesome and the prices are reasonable. &#160;Very trendy spot....a must try. Nice asian fusion restaurant in downtown Seattle. The satay dishes are real good, but the portion are small for the price. &#160;Atmosphere and decors &#160;are very nice but a little too dark. Can't really remember much because I had one too many wines during my visit.
Another hidden gem off of Rainier Ave. &#160;If you're looking for a great place for gyros, then this one is for you. &#160;This place packs the gyro with meat. &#160;They're definitely not skimpy at this place. &#160;The sauce just adds to the already awesome flavor. &#160;The service is very friendly and fast. &#160;The atmosphere is laid back and extremely clean. &#160;There isn't a lot of room for huge parties, but there are enough tables/booths to break up, if necessary. &#160;Lastly, the price is great for this place. &#160;Well worth it! As you drive into the parking lot of Mawadda Cafe, you might think to yourself: Really? Mediterranean food in the middle of South Seattle? Yes, that's right. And Mawadda has some of the best. I tried the Chicken Shawarma. It was so so good. The chicken was tender and flavorful and the rice that was served with it was delicious too. Their garlic sauce is to die for. I seriously would just eat that sauce with everything. The salad was fabulous too.The place was relatively clean and servers were nice. I wish we got water though...we had to ask for some. Delicious food every time. &#160;I always get the shawarma. &#160;The cooking preparation time is slow though. I think the thing I like best about Mawadda's falafel is the pita. It's soft, chewy, and really delicious. The lettuce and tomato are always fresh. The falafel itself is good but, as others have noted, very crumbly. Definitely don't try to eat this in your car or you will make a huge mess! Got a Shish-Kabob combo for lunch. Lamb was great, chicken okay, beef over cooked. Took quite awhile for them to make it considering I was the only one in the place in the early afternoon. Rice was good, sauces not for me, but maybe that's just me. Will come again and try other dishes. It's next to a halal shop. It's dingy. They sell that gross salty yogurt drink. These were all promising signs, and Mawadda delivered. I'm a recent import from Michigan, and I found out the hard way that good Middle Eastern food is a rarity here. The lamb is excellent. The garlic sauce is aggressive. The spanakopita is perfect. And the baklava earned a moment of silence. This place is great. The owner is great. The food is great. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma sandwich and side of regular fries (to eat there) at the counter from the slightly gruff but not unfriendly proprietor. &#160;He asked me if I wanted my chicken spicy and the obvious answer was YES!. &#160;He directed me to sit down. &#160;Strangely, he didn't ask me to pay at this point, which you would expect when putting your order in at the counter, but every place has their own system. &#160;He brought me ice water as requested very promptly, but I was the only one eating, so that would be expected. &#160;The shawarma sandwich took a while to appear, while much clattering, chopping and other food preparation sounds emerged from the kitchen area, but when it did, I was more than happy to tolerate the wait, as the Shawarma Sandwich was outstanding! &#160;You know, though I didn't look into the kitchen while my sandwich was being prepared, I have the sense that they were making it fresh, not scooping some precooked chicken out of a pan, so I'm okay with the wait. &#160;They don't cheap out on the fillings here: the pita was stuffed with spicy chicken, along with lettuce, tomato and sauce. One of the best I've had. The fries were fine too, very hot and crisp. &#160; I have a Mr. Gyro location a few blocks away from me in Greenwood that also does a Shawarma Sandwich, but theirs is a sorry disappointment compared to Mawadda's offering, and in the future, I'll be happy to drive all the way down to Hillman City, which is almost in freakin' Renton(!) for Mawadda's version. &#160;That's how good it is! Food was fantastic, even for a hard to please food conoseur(sorry one semester french in high schhol), but I think if they added a server, things would be much better. I had to clean my own table, which took away from a 5 star review. &#160;I would still go and enjoy their food. Plus, being halal means that the meat is organic and animals are not raised in squalid condtions. We came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. We had the spicy chicken gyro with Greek fries. It took awhile to get our food but we weren't disappointed when we &#160;tasted our food. The gyro was a good size. I couldn't finish mines. The Greek fries were so yummy. It gets really busy here, we dined in. I suggest to call in &amp; take your order to go.
I had been holding off on visiting Bastille for months - every time I thought of going, someone would mention that their food was "so-so" or the service was "meh." &#160;Reading some of the review on Yelp just made me more sluggish about checking it out. &#160;But my husband and I finally decided to try dinner there New Year's Day, and wow, what a pleasant surprise! &#160;Lovely, knowledgable service. &#160;Great attention to detail with the decor, and a fun vibe. &#160;And the food - yum! &#160;We tried a couple of specials - kohlrabi soup with lobster and a hash with Brussels sprouts - which were both just perfect in execution and portion size. &#160;Got the "basic" garden salad, which I thought would be kind of boring, but was amazingly fresh and enjoyable to eat. &#160;Predictably, the French onion soup and steak frites were delicious. &#160;Not as predictable was the peanut butter ice cream, which didn't really make sense (when I lived in France nobody ate peanut butter, or could even purchase it), but was amazing enough to be inhaled by me and my husband within seconds.Bottom line: &#160;this place is worth checking out. &#160;Maybe they have worked out their service and kitchen kinks, or maybe my friends and fellow Yelpers are just too darn picky. &#160;Personally, I loved it and plan to come back soon. Like their menu says..."Damn good French food." We arrived at 6pm without a reservation so we were seated in the bar area in the back. It worked out well because the vibe was livelier than the front and suited us well.All their food is local and they even grow many of their veggies on their rooftop garden; hard to believe with Seattle's lack of sun but they promise it's up there (although they wouldn't show us..hmmm). They have a really good happy-hour appetizer selection for $5 and we chose the mussells and I cannot recommend them enough. They were very fresh and didn't have too much butter on them. Also, the serving was large for $5.For my main I had the sea bass which was the nights special. It was very good but I could have used twice the amount of fish...although what do I expect from a French restaurant? My uncle both had the beet salad with chevre and said it was very good. Cheers Atmosphere - checkFood - checkService - checkBastille has been on my list of restaurants to try for quite some time. &#160;I've read mixed reviews, but I finally decided to give it a go. &#160; They are obviously trying to go for the Paris Bistro feel and they full it off. &#160;Most restaurants that try this usually end up feeling like an Disney Epcot version. &#160;The service was very attentive without feeling intrusive. &#160;If you needed something, the wait staff would be strolling by in a few minutes. &#160;I never had that dreadful feeling of being ignored.The food, oh the food. &#160;The food is simple, but very well executed. &#160;I had a pork belly with apples and picked onions. &#160;It had very few components but was just done perfectly. &#160;Isn't that what simple food is all about? &#160;My wife had the steak frites with roquefort. &#160;The steak, while not being a monster like you'd get from a steak place, was extremely tasty and actually cooked to medium. &#160;Why is it that I can get a steak cooked to the exact temperature that we ordered at a French style bistro, but not at a steak restaurant? &#160;The fries were really well done. &#160;Perfectly crispy on the outside, silky smooth inside and seasoned with plenty of salt.I had the cassoulet for dinner. &#160;Cassoulet is one of those dishes that I am powerless to resist when it's on a menu. &#160;Duck confit, sausage, pork, and white beans, what's not to like? &#160;Theirs didn't disappoint. &#160;Taste and texture were spot on. &#160;We had the tarte tatin for dessert. &#160;Wow! &#160;I don't use exclamation points lightly, but this stuff was fantastic. &#160;Buttery pastry with perfectly cooked apples and ice cream. &#160;I usually don't expect much when I order dessert, but the tarte tatin was just great.Cafe Campagne used to be our go-to French place. No longer. Good food and great cocktails combined with classy barmen. &#160;Cocktails: &#160;I had the "Bicycle" (i don't pretend to write french) cos of the combo of Gin and St. Germain, it was a very well made/thought out drink. &#160;My girlfriend had the Rosemary Lemonade, also very nice.Dinner/Bar Apps: &#160;Baguette with butter from Grand Central = grand central bakery is fantastic. &#160;Rabbit "Galette", this was the highlight of the night, really tasty. &#160;the only negative on the rabbit was the girlfriend got two little chipped bones which goes with the territory when dealing with rabbit. The larger potatoes it was served with seemed slightly undercooked.Gnocchi - they were good, we both lived in Italy for 4 years so it was our mistake to think they were going to be Italian gnocchi.Lentils - I love lentils and these could have been excellent but they seemed about 5 minutes from perfectly cooked.Though, i don't know how the french do lentils so maybe they were just right. &#160;***Props to the prep guy who did an amazing amount of work to get tiny, tiny square "soffritto" as the veggie base for the lentils.A very good meal and great service at the bar top by Deveaux, the barman and Charles, the bar manager.Thanks, will definitely be back. I want to LOVE Bastille. I want to share my commitment and desire for a long-lasting friendship. I want it to be the go-to place for those "Date Night With Myself" evenings where I relax comfortably at the bar and get my best people watching game on. I want them to eventually get my name spelled correctly when I call and make reservations.So Bastille has the potential to be all of this but last Saturday, which was unofficially called "Date Night With Four of My Girlfriends," most everything fell flat.They stuck us in a booth in the back of the restaurant right by the kitchen. The only thing I enjoyed about this was being close to all of the good-looking male staff. It was otherwise very uncomfortable, cramped, and loud.We received our drinks about 30 minutes after we were seated &#160;as we didn't get to put in our order until the 20 minute mark. Our waitress was more attentive to the weird man dressed as court jester sipping on martinis (no joke) than she was to us. &#160;We had to flag her down for just about everything.Lastly there is the food. I must admit.... they do some pretty impressive things in that kitchen of theirs. I had the falafel wrap with salade verte. Other plates served at our table included the lamb burger and frites, magret de canard (duck), coquilles st-jacque (scallops), courge roti (roasted squash). All very tasty dishes. None of the ladies complained, everyone raved. Yum. Holiday Cheer.So my reviews are mixed. I'm not swearing off Bastille because of how fantastically gorgeous it is in there and how fantastically gorgeous it makes me feel. It's not too bad on the pocket-book and at least I'll get a decent meal out of it no matter the other inconsistencies. I love that their menu is organic and sustainable. Especially because my allergies are such (chemicals murder me) that it makes eating out really hard sometimes.The happy hour at Bastille is spectacular. Tasty bites for a reasonable price. If it's still on the menu, I recommend the squash and the mussels. Both were wonderful and light.The breakfast there was very good (Sundays). Not the best eggs benedict I've ever had, but very good nonetheless. Also, when you order a side of bacon, a LOT of bacon comes out. Everyone at the table got to wear the "bacon face" (something of a hybrid between "Duhhhhhhhhh" and an Orgasm).Our waiter was very friendly, and helpful with suggestions. I'd definitely suggest Bastille for anyone, but especially those concerned about what ingredients go down the gullet. After a long day of doing absolutely nothing, we started out here for HH. &#160;My intention was stay through dinner and actually try some entrees, but we didn't get there. &#160;Mussels in a curry (that reminded me of a dish my mom used to make using geoduck), a simply outstanding lamb burger, bread, olives and frites g0t us sated and happy. &#160;Throw in a couple rounds of bee's knees and we were good to go. &#160;We sat on the side, in the covered area and it never really got busy. &#160;When I go again, I want to sit inside and people watch more. &#160;The back bar, by the restrooms was full, though.I almost knocked this down a half star, because the staff was not friendly at all. &#160;It was strictly, take our order and walk away. &#160;No conversation or checking in on us at all. &#160;For such a fun place, I expected a little better. Tried Bastille again last night.I'm still sticking with a solid three stars, but I had a better experience this time than last (although I also decided to forgo dessert here and hit the gelato place down the block instead after last time's disappointing dessert). &#160;We arrived about 6PM and the bar was hopping but most of the tables were still empty. &#160;That said, is was pretty darn loud in there. &#160;Once the tables filled in the noise level ratcheted up to the point where I had to keep leaning over to hear what my friend was saying. &#160;I love the decor of Bastille, but it might be worth looking into adding some sort of "soft" accoutrements to dampen the noise. &#160;Bastille is one of the places in Seattle that is now charging for bread, but it is good bread. &#160;Menu description: "GRAND CENTRAL BAGUETTE $3 with Plugr&#225; butter &amp; sea salt. Semolina baguette with a classic crust served with European-style creamery butter. We're happy to refill the basket at no additional cost." Honestly, we refilled the basket once and both enjoyed the baguette so much that it was indeed worth paying for bread. &#160;I ordered the confit de canard (Crispy duck leg with red wine braised cabbage &amp; lardons) and it was one of the better confits I have enjoyed. &#160;I'll be back for the confit, as man cannot live on bread alone (HAHAHAHA, uh, sorry for the digression....). My friend ordered the cassoulet (White bean stew, duck confit, Toulouse sausage &amp; pork shoulder) so the emerging theme for the evening was ducks and pigs. &#160;I has a bite of his and it was quite good. &#160;The one place where Bastille stands out is in their cocktail menu. &#160;I enjoyed La Muse (Vodka, grapefruit &amp; Cassis with a splash of Cr&#233;mant, served on the rocks) so much that I ordered another. &#160;My friend tried the French (Gin, Champagne, lemon &amp; sugar) and proclaimed it delicious. The menu says "damn good French cuisine" and they're spot on. &#160;First, the Ballard area is just cool - a great vibe and charming town feel. &#160;Second, the room at Bastille is fantastic; in fact, I'd go to their website and read about the design touches before you go so you can appreciate them.Food is French bistro fare at its best. &#160;I was here for a biz dinner, and the group had steak frites, sandwich au confit du porc, fricasse de poulet and the cassoulet (my pick). &#160;Can't speak for the other dishes, but my dining companions devoured every bite. &#160;The cassoulet was outstanding and a nice fit for 42 degrees outside and rain (in other words, April in Seattle).Our server was attentive without being overbearing, showed up at just the right times and gave us a lot of space to enjoy our dinner. &#160;Nice, nice wine list, good beers.Only word of advice is that Ballard is a very popular area and parking is at a premium, but it is well worth it to sample Bastille. &#160;It's officially a "favorite haunt" after one visit. Yumm, definitely a place to come back to... We had a party of 6 with a reservation around 10am on Sunday morning for brunch. We weren't aware of the farmer's market going on since we don't live in the relative area so that made parking a little troublesome but nothing worth avoiding this place for. We had reservations and still had to wait about 5-10 min for our table but it was fine, pleasantly we were seated in the outdoor covered patio, the heat lamps did get to be a bit overbearing as it was coming right down on your face but it even'd out after a bit. The coffee is very strong plus for me but a warning for those of you looking for a weaker companion. We did have a child with us and as its not particularly geared toward children (no specific kids menu) it was still quite nice.The food was delish and all of us were happy with our selections and the portions were plentiful.Definitely worth trying out. Had an amazing dinner at Bastille this week. &#160;I never go wrong when ordering from the plat de jour menu. &#160;I am totally obsessed with the house made cheese that was paired with rooftop arugula and pickled beets, it was so light but creamy at the same time. &#160;They need to start selling this cheese!We also had the salmon special which lasted about two minutes at our table. &#160;It came with smoked oyster mushrooms, bok choy and a green garlic broth. &#160;If I could do it over again, I wouldn't share this dish, I would eat it all myself.I can't wait to get back and see what they do with all the spring veggies! I really like that the restaurants in ballard have curtains behind the entry way so you see the atmosphere after you walkin. &#160;I tried the mussels and fries here and they are really good! &#160;Service was slow that night because we were seated at the bar even though we made reservations that night. There is also a downstairs also that is more publike. &#160;I would like to come back just because there aren't many french restaurants around here that are as affordable and classy as this place. :) I went to Bastille for the first time with a friend last night. It was amazing! I really loved the atmosphere. It feels like a cozy Parisian restaurant down the street. We were in there late around 10pm to let the busy dinner crowd die down a bit. Our sever was excellent and the food was exactly what we wanted! I ordered the Moules Frites and it was wonderful! I can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu. I also really enjoyed the chalkboard menu of what ingredients were currently being offered fresh from the rooftop garden. The only reason I hesitate to give 5 stars is because we walked in and had to wait around for the host to appear. He had to seat a table prior to seating us and it was a little awkward at first, standing there wondering if anyone was going to help us. Very, very good. 40 min wait w/o reservations on a Sat nite. Bar was packed, we waited down the street and called when table was ready---how's that for service?Hubs started with frog's legs special---came with a dill sauce and was very good. I felt apps were rather high in price---green salad for $9? Maybe its enough for a small entree, I don't know. I had the loup de mer, and even though a very thin filet, it was not overcooked. Came with lots of beets. It was very nice. Hubs had steak w/Roquefort, it was perfectly cooked. Again, I think they charged him $2 for about 3 tablespoons of aioli. Dining companions had the falalfel and the grilled sandwich, they appeared to enjoy them. I would def return bc of the fun atmosphere and service. Def worth it. Cool spot! I love how charming it is. Looks like a great place to go on a date. I went here last night for the first time, although we didn't eat here, we did grab some drinks at the bar. The place is dimly lit, spacious, really nice. The prices are alright (for drinks), the bartender are very very friendly, and I would definitely come back here to try some food next time. We took a look at their food menu and saw some dishes around us and it looked very tasty! I had heard great things about Bastille Cafe as a brunch spot in Ballard. &#160;And at first after my dish, I was a little disappointed. &#160;But the remnants of the Dining Diva's brunch gave me a glimpse into why people have such positive reactions. &#160;I am sure that it is a place we will be revisiting, especially when we have family in town. &#160;Next time, I just might have to be a little better in my food selection.For the full review and pictures, check out http://deckonfood.com/?p&#8230; I really wanted to like this place. The interior was fantastic, as was the atmosphere. Unfortunately, that's where the good ends. I had the cured salmon with soft boiled eggs, Flanchet de boeuf, and buttermilk sherbet for dessert. The salmon was not good at all; I had about two pieces and left it at that. The egg had so much salt on it that I could barely taste the egg, and the steak was overcooked. I will say that the steak came with mushrooms covered with a dijon sauce which were fantastic. The buttermilk sherbet was oddly sour.For the price, the food was not worth it. I've been here a number of times and always seem to have the most enjoyable visits sitting at the bar. The bartenders are friendly, just as knowledgeable as the servers about the food, and are god damn cocktail artists. The food is phenomenal - Very hard to pick a "wrong" dish. Basically if you don't like Bastille than you can go kick rocks. The environment is alive and energetic. &#160; Without a reservation we had to wait at the bar which was just fine. &#160;Great after work dinner place, looking forward to returning.However, for the price, I was not blown away by the meal. &#160;I probably just ordered the wrong thing. &#160;I had been craving a steak for a week and when I saw it on the menu it just seemed like a great choice.Don't get me wrong, the steak was a tasty piece of meat. It was good but for the price, I was expecting just a little bit more. &#160;On my plate was a $3 - $4 cut of prime sirloin, $1 of Rockford cheese and $1 worth of French Fries for $24. &#160;The Aioli was very, very nice.I'm looking forward to going back; I will try something more "French" like the rabbit. &#160;The lamb burger was a hit at our table.Pros: &#160;Classy and energetic environment. &#160;High quality food and drinks. Cons: &#160;Some menu items may be over priced. I love the energy of this restaurant. &#160;It is a romantic and lively place with delicious food and drinks. &#160;The staff is friendly and unpretentious. &#160;The Steak Frites was really yummy and I will definitely order the Bee's Knees (gin, fresh lemon and honey) again. The top of Bastille's one-page menu says it best: "Damn good French cuisine." My wife and I have been to Bastille probably 7-8 times, and we love it. The food is always fantastic (creative, fresh, well cooked and properly seasoned), the cocktails very tasty. It's both a great happy hour or a let's-go-out-for-dinner destination. Honestly, I've never even liked French Onion soup, but Bastille has made me a believer. If it's available, fall over yourself to order it. Seriously. I'm not joking. You won't be disappointed. What's robbing Bastille of it's 5th star is its construction. Its interior is beautiful, but they didn't 'pad' any surfaces, leading to a very loud dining experience when it's a full house. I can't say that I've been to a louder restaurant. Also, the service is *usually* good, but a few times it's been mediocre. Other than those two mostly minor nits, Bastille is the real deal in French cruisine. The Recessionista's Trip to FranceI've always wanted to go to France. So far, a lack of money (and a dream guy for a trip to the most romantic get-away in the world) have gotten in the way. In the meantime, I'll be visiting Bastille. Many times. :) I went on a Sunday night with a few of my girlfriends. We arrived early (5:30ish) and were seated right away. It seemed like we beat the rush--it was pretty crowded by 7:00. I had a wonderfully simple salad made with greens grown at Bastille, toasted hazelnut and fresh parmesan (so delicious &#160;that I actually ate the whole thing and only took a few bites of my incredible meal!). For dinner, I had steak and frites (the quintessential French dish, naturally). I took most of it home and the steak was still perfect on day two. The only downside? Paying for bread and butter (I hate being nickeled and dimed by restaurants!). But if I were Jean Valjean, this is the kind of bread and butter that would be worth jailtime. Delish! The atmosphere was cozy--I loved the lighting and vintage French vibe. I did notice a few kids. I wouldn't recommend it as a kids' place for dinner, though. Let the grown-ups have their fun and their romance. It is France, after all, right? ;) My friend and I were in Ballard last night all dressed up and were looking for a little more swanky place for a drink, we came across Bastille Cafe &amp; Bar. It is a quaint restaurant and bar with a fun French flair. The design of the bar is gorgeous, with a steel bar and what looks to be an old fashion mantel painted black with great detail. There is also a table with a fire pit in the middle. The bar menu is amazing with many different types of champagne and exquisite french cocktails. We were not hungry but I did notice the menu with looked very yummy, plus I am a fan of steak and frites, which the person next to me got. The steak was a nice size and the frites came all wrapped in a little paper cone. The bartender was very nice, he was attentive but also made sure we were just left to sit and enjoy each other. If you want a taste of Paris in Ballard this is the place to go. I will definatly be back with the hubs for some steak and frites! The back bar is the place to be on a Friday/Saturday/RANDOM Monday night. &#160;Their food is delicious and if you catch them at happy hour, it's definitely a lot less expensive. &#160;Being a vegetarian, there aren't many things on the menu to eat, but you can easily get a delicious falafel wrap and some champignons which are out of this world (and loved by meat eaters as well). &#160;If you're not a vegetarian, go for the mussles, it's Moules Mondays for the month of March!The decor is warm and cozy and the service is supurb! I've never had to wait long for a drink, the servers are quick to respond to any request and fill up your water without even having to ask repeatedly for it. &#160;Overall, it's a great place for all of the following:1. A romantic dinner2. A family dinner3. Drinks with friends4. Last call drunken ridiculousness5. Happy Hour I haven't spent enough time in Ballard but I am really glad that I got to check out this restaurant. &#160;It had a very French feel and one of my buddies who spent time in France really got a kick out of all the subtleties of French style that surrounded us. &#160;I thought the atmosphere was clean and lively and we decided to sit around the fire near the bar since there was only 4 of us and it was freezing outside. &#160;Good choice.The restaurant is actually very large however the service is good and prompt. &#160;They were out of the duck that night but I imagine it happens sometimes. &#160;I ordered a steak and it came out tender with a ton of flavor so I was extremely happy with my food. &#160;My friends ordered a bit more French entrees and they all liked them quite a bit. &#160;They seem to get a lot of their vegetables locally and have a chalkboard near the entrance with their local options so that was great because they are paying attention to our world and getting quality ingredients... instead of most places just interested in the bottom line. &#160;You pay for it but the food is definitely worth it!I really enjoyed Bastille and will definitely go back to try some different things. &#160;Ballard is definitely a great area so places like this are making me want to spend much more time exploring what it has to offer. After my most recent visit to Bastille (a fourth without a review, my God!), I have two things to say. First, I'm grateful I had three other visits to balance this one out. Second, I'll need three more visits to balance this one out.I've been to Bastille for a lovely peanut butter dessert and French 75 in the summertime, basking in the warmth of the patio. I've been to Bastille for beautiful salads, easing my sadness at returning from Paris and leaving French food behind. I've been to Bastille for a fantastic lamb burger, washed down with expertly chosen glasses of red wine.But although I've read about moments where other food lovers have been confronted with a culinary disaster, I've never been anywhere and had my meal fall into that category. Except now I can say I've been to Bastille for my first (and hopefully only) time for that.Back bar, happy hour. Sexy spot, beautifully tempting and well-priced cocktails, and excellent service. No complaints as far as that goes: the problem arrived in the form of a sunchoke gratin. I've cooked sunchokes before, and in fact many a root vegetable in many a way, and one of the ways you know that your root vegetable is in fact a cooked one is by testing its give. And when you can barely force a knife through its fibers, it isn't done. And so that means you shouldn't pop it into a little broiling dish and cover it with a decent comte and cream gratin and send it out.And thank God I was only paying the $5 happy hour price for it, because if I'd had to pay the regular menu price of $13, those would have been the most begrudged dollars I've ever spent on food anywhere. (By the way, that includes the dollars spent on food in my Yelp review of Denny's: check it.)I know this kitchen is capable of good-to-great things, and I hope to be back to try some more of those offerings. But at the same time, this gratin was one of the worst-prepared dishes I've had in Seattle, and I'm surprised it made it out to the floor. Next time? Lamb burger, baby. And maybe a fourth star.... I'll admit upfront that I'm a little biased towards this place since I met my boyfriend here. haha. The first time I came here, it was for a birthday party. &#160;I had the petite soupe a l'oignon: gratin&#233;ed French onion soup with cave-aged Gruy&#232;re. &#160;It was good but I didn't think much of it afterward.We decided to come back for an anniversary for old times sake. &#160;My boyfriend made reservations about 2 weeks in advance. &#160;Andddd they promptly lost it. &#160;They tried to seat us by the fire pit but I wanted a proper table so we waited there with some bread. &#160;The table took a good 20 minutes (it was a Monday) and I'm pretty sure the waitress forgot about us. Once seated, we ordered a carafe of house white wine and I ordered the risotto and champignons sauvages: risotto with foraged mushrooms, mascarpone &amp; parmesan. &#160;My boyfriend ordered a duck and potato dish (can't remember the name as they have a few similar ones). &#160;Both were excellent (duck according to him). &#160;The risotto, mushrooms and cheese were seriously melt in your mouth, some of the best risotto I've had. &#160;The ambience is also nice and romantic. &#160;You've got your cute French decor, the candles, mood lighting. &#160;I would recommend this place for a date. I'm sure we'll be back. :) Just lovely. A very European air without the snobbery. And the food is delightful! We went for the prix fixe SRW meal (one of my favorite ways to see if hyped places are worth it), and Bastille exceeded expectations.I had a smoked salmon appetizer -- basically the rich man's lox &amp; bagles -- and the salmon was a perfect texture and flavor, the pea vines were a lovely afterthought, and the egg was done beautifully. The broth for the entree steamed clams was perfectly balanced and flavorful. I had two of the specially designed cocktails (La Bicyclette and the Darjeeling Express), and they both were inventive, interesting and amusing to the tongue. Also, the waiter's eagerness and enthusiasm to discuss the drinks with us was adorable (and the service throughout the meal excellent)! The only thing that was slightly disappointing was dessert. My mini-brioche-like biscut was a bit dry and hard, and the sauces that came with it a bit dull, however, the rum-soaked balls of apple hidden under the whipped cream were a comforting burried treasure.All and all, Bastille landed another couple of regulars via SRW, and I'm excited to see what else they've got! Love the interior and decor of this place. &#160;Great for dates.Came here on Wednesday night and the crowd was a little older; &#160;I guess that's usually the case for a moderately priced restaurant. extensive wine selection but i wasn't feeling fancy so opted for beer. We ordered baguette to start. &#160;I ordered the pan roasted chicken and my friend ordered the mussels and frites. The chicken was nicely plated. &#160;It was moist but the sauce was a tad bit salty. &#160;The mussels came piled high in a thin/light curry base (hinted with star anise?).Food is good would come again. Cool place. Good croque monsieur.I'm definitely planning to return. Best falafel I've ever had. Done just right and tasty. Also tasted the Mediterranean sea bass and that was excellent also. Went with a group of friends on a February Sunday evening and were seated out on the heated enclosed patio. Service started out good, then dropped off as the place filled.Prices are high relative to the portion size. $12 for a bibb lettuce head cut in half and a wedge of Gorgonzola blue cheese? But if you like this kind of thing, primarily meat-based french country cooking, that probably goes with the territory.Back bar looks like a good alternative for an evening out, and I think they serve food back there too. Old/new world ambiance and vibe. Cute, cute, cute! I love the space, very airy with a French bistro feel. They have a nice little terrace area which I imagine can be great during the summer and they also had a round fireplace bar which I thought was cool to eat around. I got the lavender brioche French toast which was good, I didn't really taste any hint of lavender though but it still wasn't bad. Service was great, no wait, and food came out fast. We also ordered bread with sea salt butter to help stave off hunger pains before our meal came out. I would have thought that though the bread/butter should be complimentary but oh wells. I would come back again but would try something new this time. Nearly everything was perfect last night on my first visit to Bastille Cafe &amp; Bar, a French restaurant in hip Ballard. &#160;A friend and I shared the palm hearts salad, the Steak Frites, and a French apple tart. &#160;I had a glass of Rhone wine to drink. The steak was cooked to perfection at medium-rare: &#160;it almost melted in your mouth with tenderness. &#160;The frites were probably the best I've had in Seattle. &#160;The palm hearts salad was the only item I wasn't 100% on - it wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked. &#160;But still, good.Even with sharing, I had plenty to eat. This would be 5-stars except for how loud the restaurant is. &#160;That is very un-French :)Smooth Fiore decaf espresso to finish. I'll be back. I ate a wonderful dinner at Bastille yesterday with my lovely lady and I was extremely impressed. The first thing that stood out to me was the beautiful layout and decor of the restaurant. Fashioned after a French Subway Station, Bastille really brings a ton of personality with it's warm decor.The food was astounding. We had an assortment of the specials, which included a delicious Foies de Volaille- Chicken Liver Pate, Clams in a Parsley Garlic Sauce, Beef Short Ribs and Brussel Sprouts in a Cheese Sauce, White Truffel Linguine, AMAZING Frog Legs, Pork Belly with Pickled Apples and Onion, and a delicious assortment of the desserts.The food was expertly prepared and full of flavor. Each bite was a party in my mouth. The desserts were by far the highlight of the dining experience for me. I had an amazing Crepe Cake accompanied by some insanely delicious homemade ice cream. Definitely try a few different dessert items, because they each have something completely different to offer.The service was wonderful. We attended dinner on a Monday, so it was not very busy. Our server was very attentive and educated when it came to the food served.Overall, I really enjoyed my dining experience at Bastille. I will definitely be coming back in the near future to see what other amazing dishes they have to offer. Let's talk about Bastille. First, I have been here in the past, liked it, but never felt compelled to say much of anything about it. A few weeks ago I came again for dinner and had a fairly memorable experience, so now it is worth discussing. General matters of note include: (1) sit in the back bar area if you can at least once because it is a cool space; (2) great ambiance. Kind of makes me feel like going to (read: long for) Balthazar in NYC. Best part about this place is the feeling that maybe you are somewhere else..like the Village, Soho or Paris; (3) everything on the menu is solid...the Steak Frites in particular has terrific flavor; (4) they serve Caffe Fiore. Hands down the best coffee in Seattle, in my humble opinion. Big plus for that. (5) dessert is nothing special...feel free to skip it in favor of the current Seattle crazes which include cupcakes, ice cream or custard. Highlight of the evening: We felt like a bottle of white, but to go with steak frites? What would it be? The server didn't have a clue, so she did the appropriate thing and sent over their sommelier. He was fantastic and pointed us in the direction of a white Bordeaux. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think it actually made the night for me. Biggest complaint: Inconsistent service. We started out with a bang, but it quickly fell off. When I have been here in the past I have never had service that was very special. That should improve to move Bastille among Seattle nighborhood dining elite. Bottom line: Well worth a try - and worthy of a repeat visit for dinner, or brunch, or drinks... Something changed for me on the night I recently dined at Bastille. Perhaps the influence of feeling like I was somewhere else did away with any politically correct Seattleite inhibitions I have left over. Or maybe I was just happy to be in Ballard again? Either way, I'm not saying it was 100% the restaurant, or that you will have a shift in perspective after eating here... But listen, it's not every day you savor a white Bordeaux on a rainy night! I will gladly fight for a space in the back bar for late night happy hour and order the lamb burger, falafel, another lamb burger. &#160;Great deals on HH cocktails too. Beautiful restaurant. When you walk in it pretty much speaks for itself. A great back bar hidden away at the back of the restaurant. Amazing decor and fabulous food to boot. Friendly staff and it's owned by two fun and down to earth men. This is a great first date place to take your girl. Very romantic and hip all at the same time. Definitely check it out. But call ahead first because the place packs out quick. Food is awesome, always awesome. Our servers are always good. One dark haired individial likes to always correct my pronunciation of French when we go, lame, but I dont go for the server, but the food, of course! &#160;Music is fantastic and food, again, is incredible. A favorite spot in Seattle - love cozy bar tucked away in the backroom, smitten upon sight. Laidback dim-lit gastropub, interesting craft cocktails.. pates and tempting small plates perfect to snack on. Great date spot or small parties. Pleasant staff, good music. Very enjoyable. &#160;The atmosphere, location, service, drinks and cuisine are classic French cuisine! A perfect unpretentious beautiful and sexy French bistro that serves classic French dishes. The service is excellent and the food is very tasty! I will definitely come back to Bastille again and again and.. Again :) Food was good, nothing supper special, really just a French bisto. Wait staff was great. So, here's the real problem. The Noise level was almost enough to make us leave, when we walked in. They made the place really nice, and then left a concrete floor, lots of glass and it makes your ears hurt. Even the waiter said, don't come on Friday, you will need a hearing aid. Oh well. Bastille is a wonderful place to grab breakfast/brunch/lunch while perusing the Ballard Market, and that's usually what I do. The place is huge so there's rarely a wait that I've seen, and the food is really fresh, whole, just.. good. Love that they source their herbs and some produce from their rooftop garden. This place does omelettes as omelettes are meant to be done... smooth, buttery, light yellow creamy goodness studded with some of those aforementioned fresh herbs. Perfect next to their crispy smashed potatoes and a cup of coffee with fresh cream. It will make you happy. Tried the lamburger and the frites. Ho friggity hum. I mean it was fine but a little greasy and on the salty side. I was there for Sunday Branch. I must say their atmosphere is excellent and service is okay. However, if you are someone who watch your weight (starch or carb) or who has some food allergy, don't go. They do not substitute anything. I was extremely disappointed the high end place like this does not willing to go extra miles to meet customer's special needs. Again, this is not the place for someone who wants balanced diet and working hard to stay thin. &#160;I also disappointed that they do not serve their coffee in a french press style. I may go back there just to enjoy the atmosphere and ignore about foods and services. Ate the pork cheeks, great. Really, really great. Bartender was fing snooty, like "I'm the only person in the world that ever learned anything about wine" snooty. Should be noted that I had this experience in July 2010. Beautiful place! Beautiful! Save the snootiness, no one gets off on it. Superb food and drinks, good service, great atmosphere. Frites are second to none, and the food I have had there is good. Only caveat is the price. Excellent french toast. &#160;Bastille takes reservations for brunch. Great happy hour drinks; try the Bees Nees or French 75. The frites are the best thing on the HH menu, all else is a little over priced. The burger is okay, but I wouldn't order again. The HH food isn't very impressive, but I'm usually content with fries and a drink.Dinner there is wonderful. Ordered the steak, and it was perfection. A friend had the salmon and loved it too. Go to Bastille for the interior design if anything, it's a beautiful restaurant. I came here for brunch on a Sunday. &#160;The place was busy as to be expected with the Ballard Famers Market going on in full force out front. &#160;I've always wanted to come here for brunch. &#160;We sat at the fireplace off the bar which was very nice. Considering how busy they are the service was good and the food didn't take to long. &#160;Two of us had the duck confit hash. &#160;I've never seen fewer potatoes served with a has and since when should duck confit be in a broth? &#160;The dish wasn't bad at all but it was on the smaller side ( espeically with the lack of potatoes) and it needed something to get all the broth so we ordered a side of bread ( perhaps it should have come with toast???). My friends lavendar french toast was very good. &#160;I've come here before for happy hour and had the falafel which was pretty good but my brunch left me somewhat unimpressed. &#160;Unless I am at the Sunday Farmers Market I doubt I'll go back again other than for Happy Hour. I came here on a very nice and sunny morning. Was seated instantly for four people. We asked for a baguette but the waitress forgot it... however, when we mentioned it she offered it to us for free. I ordered the lavender hazelnut french toast. I just could not believe how great it was. It was perfectly cooked. For all of you newbie's to Seattle like I am, finding a new "hole in the wall" is what life is all about, isn't it? When i was invited out on a first date to Bastille (the back bar - I still haven't been up front), I honestly had never heard of it. Wow, was i pleasantly surprised. First of all, the place is really beautiful inside with what i can only describe as authentic french style artwork and interior layout. It seems as though they have spared no expense in any aspect of recreating a uniquely french and NW hybrid of design. The food was superb, I had the croque off the happy hour menu and couldnt have been happier. The only negative point that I would say was that the layout was a little cluttered and getting from our seats to the bathroom or to the bar was congested. I feel like they could have taken out some of the extra seating to make the customers feel like it was more intimate. I wish i could have given them a 4.5 star but this site doesnt allow that.... Besides that though, the bartenders really knew their drinks and were very helpful with the menu. I will come back for sure for the front restaurant for a full dinner! A great place to meet up with friends for happy hour. The atmosphere is especially warm on a colder, rainy day. Their bread is super yummy. The sunchoke gratin was perfect. The cocktails are divine. If you are patient and like a more adult environment. This is a great place for a romantic dinner or night cap. The service is good and the wait staff knowledgeable about the menu. i must have become a "yelper" after i'd dined here a few times, as i'm surprised i haven't already reviewed bastille. anyhow, went in on a friday night for dinner a few weeks ago and enjoyed:GRAND CENTRAL BAGUETTEWith Plugr&#225; butter &amp; sea salt**yumSALADE VERTE.Mixed greens in champagne vinaigrette with crushed hazelnuts**and they grow their own lettuce (during growing season) on their roof! how cool is that? otherwise it's local lettuce/produce. i thought $9 was a little steep for a green salad, but such as it is.POISSON DU JOUR**there were 2 fish of day specials this dining evening and my companion and ordered 1 of each to share. 1 was the wild king salmon with baby bok choy and something else that embarrassingly escapes me now but was good; and the other was halibut with a mushroom ragu so rich and flavorful a whole entree could have been made from that alone! and spinach.GRATIN DE CARDONChard gratin with fennel cream &amp; comt&#233; cheese**scrumptious. can't really go wrong with dark hearty greens and cheese, now can you?SALTED PEANUT BUTTER CR&#200;ME GLAC&#201;E Cocoa nib feuilletine &amp; Jivara cr&#232;meux**i've ordered this 3 times now because i'm so in love with that. perhaps it's time i branch out to other desserts on the menu which i'm sure are also delectable, but this is just sublime. my date didn't feel like dessert so i was forced (!) to eat this all on my own (the hardship!). creamy peanut butter ice cream, with only a light salted flavor, not over the top, and these decadent granola-like clusters of thin crispy crunchy flakes. incredible.i really like the energy of this place - always bustling with lots of people. we sat in the heated enclosed patio which was almost too warm but so nice on a cold night. i was under-impressed with our server who seemed bored and didn't offer much to the dining experience. Bastille has been around for a solid year now. &#160;Happy hour menu is great. &#160;Try the monk's habit and if you like lamb and you like burgers, by all means you have to try to lamb burger. &#160;The other plus to the place is the atmosphere. &#160;They have a little known back bar that is awesome. &#160;The attention to every detail with the bar, the interior design, circle fireplace near the window, the tiled columns etc... I usually don't notice those types of things that much in a restaurant, but you cant help notice the amazing atmosphere and beautiful details in the place. &#160;Makes me feel like I am at an older restaurant in Paris or Italy. The decor is pretty cool. This is definitely one of the trendy places to go in Ballard. &#160; I think that the happy hour is probably where you get the best experience, but I haven't had the opportunity to do this yet. Went on a date night (Saturday). Without reservations, the bar was the only option without a wait. &#160;I ordered a tomato salad, which was rather bland and nothing special and the pork confit sandwich. &#160;The sandwich was RICH. After asking the server about how it was prepared, I thought it would melt in my mouth, but I found it to be too rich and it was just missing something-maybe just more of the mustard sauce. &#160;My hubby ordered the lamb burger, which is definitely a winner ( I don't even like lamb all that much). It was really good and had an awesome sauce. The frites, as expected, were pretty good too. &#160;Overall, the place is a bit spendy (probably to pay for the truly awesome decor) and didn't quite deliver, but I will try again. I really wanted to like this place; it's just a lovely space and has so much potential. We've tried it 5 or 6 times now and our experience never gets any better. Specifically the reception from the staff; warmth is not their forte. We eat out a lot and one of our favorite haunts in Cafe Press, the French Cafe in Capital Hill. We were just there yesterday and our experience was miles and miles better than our experience at Bastille today. It's like Bastille hires their staff from outer space or something. For instance today, I asked our waitress if she'd ever tried the lamb burger with feta and she gave me this long, puzzled expression (head cocked to the side) and it took about 15 seconds to answer; I thought that the question was either off-putting or she'd had a small seizure. It was really weird; we asked each other later what that was all about. It was like I'd asked her to recite Pi. The service is inattentive and she never came back to check on us during our meal. They were out of the lamb burger as it turns out (this has happened to us often - they run out of things) so I ordered one of their omelets. Not only was it bland but they got my order wrong. It's just eggs - come on people. Omelets at High Spot and Portage Bay put Bastille's to shame. Comparing French Cafes, in comparison Cafe Press' overall experience including their omelets, frites and croque monsieur are much better than Bastille's. I would give it 1 star if it were not for the decor, location, espresso and the lamb burger (sans the disappointing frites). I decided today this was the last time I'd give Bastill a try; I'll just high tail it over to Cafe Press or Le Pichet where the food and service put Bastille to shame. i love this place for breakfast/bunch, finally had dinner there the other night. got the MAGRET DE CANARD (duck breast) it was alright, i don't think i will go their for dinner again. for french dinners there are much better places in seattle
Called to make reservations, no one answered, so I left a message with my info. When we got to the restaurant, the gentleman at the desk did not have our reservation. But guess what, we got a table anyway. Super nice and helpful, stress free...thank you!We ordered a handful of "petite plates" with the star being the Crispy Pork Belly w/ Pole Bean Salad...beautimous. I must mention the French Dirt martini partnering with the Citrus Cured Salmon w/ Potato Salad and Arugula. Fantastic.The downside was the server wasn't much help as far as describing the food (not asking for a dissertation by any stretch) and seem kinda...well...sad. In turn, the "sad server" act made the food come off as being a bit stuffy. In his defense, being a veteran of the service industry myself, I guess I can understand being a bit overwhelmed, the place was a-jumpin! I will be back to check out the entrees and that damn sexy back bar.Good job guys! I'm torn between giving 2 or 3 stars. I liked the atmosphere but the server was not very helpful &amp; seemed emotionless like a robot....The frites were stale (how that happens? I haven't a clue) and the falafel was ok but maybe a little on the tart side. The cherry martini was great though.I might try them again later once they are more put together? I wanted to like it~!! It's very, very pretty, but man I expected this place to have amazing food. &#160;We waited 20 minutes just to get a menu, but then watched a man that sat down after us eat an entire meal. Food was either cold or crappy -- honestly, If can do better I don't need to leave the house, right?To top it off the bartender started playing some white boy blues much too loud. Note to the owners, if you have a member of your staff with crappy taste in music, hand select what they can play. &#160;After that, we ran out of the place. Finished our night at Ocho listening to Nina Simone. Tried this place out tonight and was quite impressed. As other people have noted the decor is very authentic and it's a nice French escape in Ballard. We went on a Sunday so there was no wait and a ton of open tables. We sat inside but it looks like the outdoor seating area is nice.The wine list is quite good as you'd expect. I was starving but thought the food was definitely worth the trip. The mac and cheese is an excellent way to start and in true French form it's nice and creamy. My wife had the fallafel which she said was good but not spectacular. I went with the classic Steak and Frites and was very pleased with the way the meet was cooked (good, medium rare as it should be) and the sauce for it. All in all this is a good spot. The wait staff seems like they're still ironing out some kinks; we got our check without asking for it and before we'd finished our main course with no asking us about desert. But all in all it has a good ambiance, it's only a tad on the expensive side, and fills a good niche in Ballard with good French cocktails and good French food. So I got into work yesterday morning and my pal Sheril was already raving about her fabulous dining experience at Bastille the night before. &#160;From her account I went immediately to their website and signed up with Open Table for reservations.I grabbed The Don of Ballard and we sashayed on over for the happy hour. &#160;My reservations were for 5:30 but I don't think we needed them as the place had only opened an hour before and there was still plenty of space. &#160;If you get there around 7 I'd say you might want to plan ahead and reserve.At first we veered out to the gorgeous outdoor patio since it was such a fine day, but we realized we really wanted to check out that saucy interior. &#160;They've kept the original facade and thoroughly worked over the interior. &#160;We were amazed at how they worked the antique feel w/the modern so easily. &#160;I couldn't get over the beauty of the fixtures, tiling, etc. &#160;We sat at one of the communal tables near the full bar and checked out both the full dinner and happy hour menu.I chose the Salad Nicoise because I had heard that most of the produce and herbs used at Bastille are grown on their rooftop garden. &#160;Also, I heard the soft-boiled eggs were devine and I've been feeling a bit like The Egg Lady from John Waters' Pink Flamingos for the past week. &#160;Don't ask me why for I do not know. &#160;I just know I am craving the egg protein as of late!The salad was exquisite. &#160;It features oil-poached tuna, fresh green beans (seriously fresh), olive tapenade, capers, those lovely fresh greens and the soft-boiled eggs certainly did not let me down.The dressing was light and just right and there was some herb that tasted a bit like liquorice that I just couldn't put my finger on and only came in a few bites. &#160;Perhaps I dreamed it, but whatever it was, it was great.The Don ordered the lamb sandwich from the happy hour menu (sans frites). &#160;Of course we shared and as soon as I took my bite I just had to tell him, "this lamb is so sexxxy!" &#160;How can it be that food can be so sexy? &#160;When its French I guess. &#160;Or maybe its just Bastille.The rest of the food and drink was extremely sexy. &#160;We ordered cocktails too: French 75 (gin, champagne, lemon and sugar) and the Rive Gauche (elderberry, Cr&#233;mant &amp; Cassis). &#160;Both were excellent.To continue with the sexiness we ordered dessert which is unusual for us. &#160;The waitress noted that the special for today was a cherry sorbet and I couldn't pass that up. &#160;Three adorable little scoops appeared before me surrounded with fresh raspberry puree and a bit of creme on the side and toasted pine nuts. &#160;The taste sensation was incredible.The Don ordered the lavendar creme brulee. &#160;I'm usually wary of lavendar desserts as sometimes the flowery taste can be too potent, but Bastille did it just right. &#160;The creme and flower together were beautiful, but I enjoyed the biscotti that came with even more. &#160;I wish I could just come by and stock up on the biscotti. &#160;Wow.So after all that I knew I had to check out the restroom as no Yelp review would be complete without checking that out. &#160;It wasn't breathtaking, but I appreciated the simpleness of it. &#160;It was then that I noticed the back bar that my dear Sheril had talked of.Next time I go, its all about that back bar area. &#160;A huge chandelier, beautiful paintings and another exquisite bar reside here. &#160;There's also a loft where it looks like they may have music playing at some point.I can't wait till the take out window is open too. &#160;I know I'll be grabbing baguettes when I stroll through the Ballard Farmer's Market on Sundays.All in all, we left completely blissed out on this gorgeous dining experience. &#160;Ahhhhh... I made reservations on http://opentable.com and requested an outside table... I get there and they tell me that they are all "reserved"..??? Ah, well the gal at the front was charming so all was okay, but still. I drove all the way over from the eastside to eat outdoors in Seattle :-(The food was rather mediocre and the server could've at least smiled once. Falafel.. don't bother with it. The frites? Nope... I mean, are they serious? Came with some kind of mayonnaise-like butter dipping sauce. Almonds and olives, meh. The cherry martini was nice, the lemon cocktail was way too sour! I enjoyed sitting in the bar area but felt it was lacking something that night.Food.. maybe 3 stars.Service.. 2 stars.I did like the set-up inside though...Maybe once they get going things will improve. The decor is gorgeous: the front bar is Parisian bistro style and the back bar is more warm and french country style. The food I ordered was good, very tasty and authentic. However, the portions are small, and the service is terrible! I ordered a salad and a glass of wine, I waited 30 min even when the restaurant was almost empty... my wine came after I finished my salad! I hesitate to come back on a busy night, I might never get served... I had brunch at Bastille today and can't wait to go back and try out the dinner menu and have drinks in the lower bar. The atmosphere is wonderful with many different seating options and I found myself not able to stop looking around at the decor and fine details put into this place.The food was absolutely delicious. I recommend the lavender french toast or the poached eggs and toast with mushrooms.  Friendly, prompt service. Great new additon to Ballard! Ballard's cool points just skyrocketed even more.I'm telling you now, Yelpers. You heard it here first. Mark my words and all that jazz. Bastille is about to be your favorite place to go. Went last night for friends &amp; family service and hoooooooly mo. The space is ridiculously amazing. Nothing like it in town, I won't do it justice trying to describe it. Think about pillaging a magical salvage yard in Paris - and you'll be on the right track. Plus there's a sexy speakeasy in the back called Back Bar that'll be open until 2am every night (I think). And there's a walk-up window that'll sell Parisian street meats like falafels (I think) and frites (plus it's right there on the Ballard farmer's market - hooray!). Huge patio with heaters. A gorgeous, long bar made entirely of zinc. In the front window, an indoor high-sitting fire pit &#160;surrounded by chairs. Salvaged bricks and industrial touches abound. Booths, regular tables, a big communal table. It's a choose-your-mood seating arrangement spanning romantic to casual. And no matter what or where, it's comfortable. Super, super, inviting and classically cool. High ceilings. Easy to breathe. Good music. Great vibe. &#160;Also, LE BEST light fixtures anywhere in town. Bet me. The one in the hallway over the bathrooms - breathless. Can't speak. Please let it be earthquake proof. If it ever drops, I'll hear it in my soul. &#160;The food and wine? &#160;Bastille is definitely going to be your favorite place in town if you like octopus, or steak frites, or halibut, or superfresh greens that come from the 2500 sq ft garden on the ROOF. Big plates, small plates, side plates. This was the kitchen's first night giving it a go, and they hit it waayyyy out of the park. Over the green wall. The mostly-French wine list is very smart, peppered with northwest gems, and 100% affordable. Another fine-crafted player in Bastille's amazing game. They must open next week-ish? I forgot to ask. Was too overwhelmed by awesome. A bientot! If a restaurant could go through puberty this would be be those awkward wonder years for Bastille.Okay - Preface.. Its new, I get it. But come on..... almost 2 hours for dinner service!Although the food was pretty good from the crispy pork to the lamb shank. The service killed the meal. I don't want to go into detail point fingers, name names . I wish I could name names but the server didn't even introduce herself. It was Sunday and maybe we just got the second stringers.Side note: please please please let me finish my meal before you ask me if I want desert. I get it you want to leave. You're young and want to hang out with your friends. But for real.. Im trying to enjoy the plate of lamb I just spent $20 dollars on and 45 minutes waiting for.I don't like to feel uncomfortable while eating. The petite plates are big enough for 2, a bite a piece, a little larger than tapas plates. The portioning on the entrees is interesting too, for example a 6oz piece of Halibut that was definitely fired before the lamb shank was loaded with fingerling potatoes and missing any sort of sauce. The rosemary lemonade cocktail was watery, i'm not even sure there was vodka in there and can you please just put a sprig of rosemary in the glass. I see your are growing herbs on the patio. I should have just gone and picked my own garnish.Two tips if you want to venture in. One: make sure you look on the mirrors for the specials as they are written in white grease pencil and extremely hard to read. The second, just wait for another 6 months and let them get into their groove. GORGEOUS, gorgeous space, as everyone's mentioned. &#160;I'm particularly fond of the back bar with it's more laid back attitude &amp; and in particular, clientele (front of the shop is still packed with see &amp; be seen-ers, not my gig). &#160;Food experience was tragic, however - avoid the falafel at all costs unless you want burnt-black and a stomach ache that lasts 14 hours (note that I was not the only one in my party to regret ordering middle eastern in a French restaurant - what can I say, they had a compelling description on the menu and it's one of the few eats offered in the back bar - full menu in front &amp; outside only). &#160;Frites were "meh", but love the truffle oil option. &#160;cant. beat. truffle oil! &#160;(Without the oil the fries would have not even made "meh" - what is the word for this? &#160;Yuck, I guess.) So perhaps it stays a drink-only stop for me, at least for a few months - it's still lovely to be there and they worked magic kitting out that building. Edit-went again. this time to the back bar. It was definately more low key, though still a &#160;'lil bit meat markety. Had 5 small plates between the 3 of us. All were good. Went in later in the evening. Was told they were full, but saw tons of open tables outside. Found a seat at the bar. Bartender was nice, but something was just missing for me. To be fair, my hubby thought he was great. Onion Soup was great, beet salad also pretty good, and I liked the kale. Steak Frites and Poached egg on toast were so so so salty, I could feel myself bloat with each bite. :( I will give em' a second chance in a year, when the crowd isn't so scenester, and they have worked out their kinks. i am torn - i dont know whether or not to give it 3 or 4 stars - i wish there were halves for half people like me.anyway, i had read a lot about the bad service etc. so i was wary. but it actually turned out to be pretty stellar service i thought. a friend and i, who are pretty familiar to the Ballard scene pre-popularity, and i had to check it out.We sat in the back bar - as the weather wasn't too great (thats what you get Seattle in July) - I wasn't too disappointed to miss the rooftop garden but would love to check it out.what i liked about the service was the super helpful waitress who was patient and had recommendations (rosemary lemonade cocktail a great refresher). when i asked about the cherries in a drink -amarina (i think) - she actually brought some over after i ordered another drink, just to try.we had just missed happy hour - which looked like it was just the bar menu with a few dollars off each dish. and despite the french name and fabulous decor (perhaps 'Ballard's answer to Cafe Presse ' holds some truth) i had to try the falafel (a recent trip to Amsterdam rendered ' the best falafels ever!, ironically). which of course had a twist with flat bread, tangy yogurt, and popping spices. nice twist, not the best.all that said, i think Bastille does Ballard good. Time will tell Bastille was beautiful. &#160;A great space, high ceilings, zinc bar, period fixtures, lots of tile, huge covered side patio with fans and overhead heaters that will probably end up being used year round (or maybe three season), happening back bar with huge chandelier, exposed ceiling and brick etc. &#160;The food was classic cafe/bistro fare. &#160;We didn't get to the main plates but nothing we ate on the small plates list was more than $14 (range $3-$14, average $9-11) and as I remember nothing on the menu was more than $20-$21. &#160;Sandwiches were $8-$12. We had one of the best croque monsieur I have ever tasted (if not the best) and a great onion soup. &#160;I had a salad Lyonnaise (frisee -- not too bitter -- amazing poached egg, extremely thick bacon chunks, and what tasted like a white balsamic vinaigrette), duck confit with lentils and we shared a pork belly, frites and charcuterie. The wine list is not tremendously extensive but it looked pretty decent, mostly but not exclusively French. &#160;Some options by the glass. &#160;There are a few high end bottles. &#160;Not much on the low end for reds. However they had a really decent house red (I want to say it was a Cotes du Ventoux though I can't remember) by the 500ml carafe for $15. The bread I think was from Grand Central bakery. The desert we had was called peanut butter glacier. &#160;It was described by our waitress as "peanut butter crack" :-) &#160;Peanut butter ice cream with these crispy and slightly chewy rocks (like a mix between a peanut butter brittle and a peanut butter caramel) served on what I guess was like a chocolate/hazelnut sauce. Had a great dinner there last night. &#160;Herb crusted halibut cooked perfectly. &#160;Steak sandwich looked delicious and also cooked perfectly, though a tad underseasoned. &#160;The toit salads were as fresh as promised, and we ordered a $15 carafe of house red wine. &#160;And online reservations, oh so easy. &#160;We will definitely be back. The space is beautiful, really well planned with attention to details. Yes, there were a few kinks but that is totally to be expected in their first week!Our food (from the bar menu) was delicious and HOT, no problems there. We had the frites, lamb burger and peanut butter ice cream. Hands down the best lamb burger I've ever had. They had a great beer menu and wine list as well. We'll be in for dinner again soon!
The pho alright. I have better. I mostly order the rice dishes instead. The service was not all that great with my experience here a couple of times. I luv the number 9..I don't think I've had much else except maybe the number 10...but I call it in for take-out all the time...they're super fast..always good..never once have I gotten food and it hasn't tasted exactly as I've come to expect..i don't eat pho anywhere else but here!!!
Pho 99 has some of the best pho I have tried, and I have been lucky enough to have Vietnamese friends schlep me to hidden pho houses. &#160;Is Pho 99 THE BEST? No. &#160;Are they exceptionally good. Yes!The broth when slurped as soon as it is brought to the table has all the flavour requirements for pho. Anise? Check. Cilantro? Check. Black pepper? Check. Beef? Check. Check. CHECK!The noodles have that slight elasticity that good rice noodles should have, not mushy like I have had at other places. *cough* Than Bros. *cough*Also, not a vegetarian or chicken soup in sight. Pho is a BEEF soup. You either get veggie noodle or chicken noodle soup at the other places. They are not Pho. &#160;I am most partial to the #18, beef tripe and tendon galore, as well as fatty brisket and flank steak. To gild the lily I will occasionally ask for the beef balls for an extra buck.The plates of mung bean sprouts, thai basil, jalepenos and limes are also gilding, because it is ALL ABOUT THE BROTH.I say, take a moment to take a deep whif of the steaming hot beef broth and savour the flavours that are infused into it. Relish the taste of the cilantro cooked into the broth and the scattered chopped leaves and green onions dotting the surface. Enjoy the beefy beefiness of it.They also make a decent Spring and Summer roll and their rice plates are good. &#160;The coffee with evaporated milk is exceptionally strong and pair this with a pho after a night of heavy drinking and you are set to get the chores done. I prefer my pho in the mornings to get me ready to deal with the day.I am not a fan of the parking lot, a bit cramped and the beggars that ask for handouts in it makes this trek a bit trying at certain times of the day. But I go because I know I will always be happy with what I get at Pho 99. Good Pho, good prices, fast and friendly service.
I stare into the window during lunch hours and find this place packed. My curiosity got the best of me, so I came here one Saturday afternoon to find it completely empty save for a crying baby. I love babies.Anyways, this place is lovely. The coconut curries are very well done, and they use red potatoes which I absolutely love. The broccoli beef is also very tasty and delicious. Overall, great food for great prices. It won't blow your socks off, but it won't disappoint either.Glad there's another Thai spot in Lower Queen that's not that overpriced, fancy-schmancy place (*cough* Racha). Yummy food and quick. &#160;Wait staff is friendly and helpful. &#160;I've noticed the place is really busy during lunch during the week, but seems fairly empty on the weekend and evenings. &#160;Still quick, hot, fresh food. &#160;Quick stop for a to-go order, too. This place saddens me, because I really love thai food and would be happy eating it with astounding frequency. They deliver, they are in my neighborhood, and they just don't do a great job. I'll walk several blocks out of my way to go somewhere else. I'm not sure what is going on here, the restaurant looks totally legit but isn't. The one thing on their menu that I've had that I would order again is the pumpkin curry, which was pretty tasty (albeit too spicy for me even when I asked for 0 stars), especially after I added a little bit of coconut milk at home to downplay the spiciness. Everything else I've had was just sub par--bland sauces, undercooked veggies, and not worth what you pay for it. No bueno. This was the only Thai place nearby that my friend and I could get a hold of on New Years day but unfortunately they do not deliver until after 5:30 pm! So we ordered for pickup and our food was ready in 15 minutes. We ordered chicken panang curry, rice and spice fried rice, and crab wontons. They go up to 4 stars but it's not as spicy as we thought it would be so next time we'll have to order 4 stars instead of 3. We like it hottt!! :) Food was delicious and reasonably priced. We sepnt $28 and were overstuffed and had leftovers. I couldn't get enough of the crab wontons, I secretly ate more than my friend when we were supposed to split it evenly :P That's how good they were. Zion Chicken:What I have been searching for and dreaming about when I think of Thai food. It has everything I ever wanted, except arms to hug me with. I've ordered take out from here twice but never dined in. &#160;The person on the phone seemed to rush my order, kind of rude and give me attitude when I want it delivered. &#160;I've had better thai but this is the closest place that delivers so I was kind of stuck with it unless I wanted to drive and get some food myself. &#160;Anyway, I won't dine here again unless somebody else wants to order AND pay. &#160;Yeah, sorry, but 16 bucks for a thai entree? &#160;30 bucks and I haven't even ordered any apps or rice yet. &#160;No thanks. &#160;Take out should be cheap and easy. &#160;Rice N Spice N Not Nice for a High Price. I swooned over the marvelously balanced spice in their pumpkin curry. It carried just a hint of heat, but rich enough that it could easily handle a few more degrees, but yet not rich enough to feel heavy.We also had a curious steak "salad", a dish served with a chunk of iceberg lettuce that admittedly brightened the spiced steak, but still seemed quick, or perhaps cheap. But maybe I'm being unnecessarily snobby about iceberg? Still, I would rather have preferred a chunk of cabbage to add a bit of sweet with the bright crunch.The service here is not for everyone's liking, but it sure fit mine: superbly efficient visiting only for a moment and only when it was clear that something needed clearing or when glasses began to empty. There is no syrupy ego-holding here; just the way it should be.Although it does suffer from dim, sleepy, overhead lighting, the kind that continues to be popular with 90% of restaurants everywhere it seems. Fortunately, this dulling effect is lessened some by the large windows in this corner location that bring in a little city light at eye-level.It was a most satisfying second visit to this comfortable space near Seattle Center, and it won't be my last.
HOMBOW!!!! Just give me a BBQ Pork Hombow and no one gets hurt. *ahem* Okay, now that I've got it together can I just tell you how delicious they are? All the hombows are good. But the BBQ Pork has to be my all time favorite. Doughy (but not too doughy), salty, sweet, and porktastic. The other stuff they have in the case besides the hombows is good too, I just am a lady that knows what I want.... which is usually the BBQ pork.And now that I don't live in Washington, it's really driven home how much I miss driving by and treating myself even though I didn't live in the area. But never fear, next visit... I will be back! Came here to try their Crab Rangoon.Parking here (Pike Place Market) is horrendous, unless you're here on a Sunday. &#160;In which case parking is free.There was a mob in front here, which is like every other place in this market.The crab rangoon is shaped like a triangular samosa. &#160;Nice gooey cream cheese, and plenty of crab meat. &#160;This is worth eating. &#160;Unfortunately it costs $2.52 so you don't want to go too crazy.I also tried a beef bun. &#160;Also $2.52? &#160;Sigh. &#160; Hello tourist tax. &#160;The bun is decent. &#160;But not $2 decent.One of the places to try once, but not sure if you'd want to come here everyday. the bbq pork bun is good.. but not as good as places in southern california..overall.. it's not worth the abdominal real estate if you're on a pike place eating tour.. but if you want a cheap tasty meal.. grab one of these buns "I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks: popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops - but hardly any meat."I'm glad someone was listening carefully when watching Something About Mary and took it to heart. This has left us with...BBQ Pork on a stick! &#160;For only a lil' over $3. &#160;I inadvertently came across it at about 9a while at Pike Place, and couldn't help but eye it. &#160;Since it was too early for that type of food I made it a point to return later. &#160;The attached pic illustrates it better than I could ever describe it!They had a lot of other things (w/ BBQ pork too) that I normally wouldn't be able to resist either. &#160;But one can only carry so much, so I was content to grab one stick and walk around with it as others checked out my food porn. There's really only one thing you need to know about Mee Sum Pastry. &#160;The ginormous hom bau in the display is really as tasty as it looks.Also, it's cheap!(+1 for their yummy steam buns as well!) Holy BBQ BUNS!I like big buns (and I cannot lie). This place makes the biggest, bbq pork buns I've ever had. The bun was sweet and the bbq filling was excellent!The BBQ pork is also available on a skewer so hit that up too! I love it here! Best Sesame seed balls!!! Yummmy... I had to go back for seconds... and thirds... oh how I wish I can move this store to California... Sesame seed balls are my cryptonite and this place has them all nice and big and puffy and crispily fried... *sigh* We tried their wontons too and that was ok. Their other pork on a stick dish that was pink was also just ok. Their pork buns was really delicious so get a couple of those as well.But the best part is that they are affordable so it felt like we can just point and try everything in sight. You have to be in a hurry since when we went on a weekend, the place had a line and it moved quickly. It's a cash only place too.Also, there's not a sit down place so it's pretty much food that you eat as you carry... But you won't regret it... maybe you'll even be thankful that you can exercise as you gobble your way through multiple servings :) awesome pot stickers right in Pike's Place Market!Very affordable too. I am a big fan of BBQ pork bun and I have been looking for a place to satisfy my craving .. so, one day, I found MEE SUM PASTRY .. &#160;and seriously, they live up to their name and the raves here on YELP .. it was one of the best BBQ bun that I had ever have in a while .. and omg I also loved their red bean sesame ball .. it was just so delicious and not too sweet .. Also, I did not wait long in line .. I think it depends on what day you visit the market .. of course, if you go on the weekend, it will be a bit worse first time ive ever heard of a hombow....i got the BBQ pork hombow and it was amazing, i love the bread, it was fresh and best of all, it was cheap for what it was, its a good place to stop by and grab a hombow and just walk around and enjoy pike place, i definitely wanna start trying the other stuff on the menu The line may be long and look intimidating but it moves quickly. However, it's not worth it...I had the BBQ pork hombow and the meat filling tasted bitter. The bun itself was pretty big but not that moist. I would suggest going to Harbor City in the International District and get an order of the baked BBQ buns there. Comes in three mini per order. It's about the same price if not cheaper for way better tasting. The hombow here at Mee Sum was a little shy of $3, not worth it considering you can usually find it in ID for around $1.50.I also had the BBQ pork stick here and I felt sick afterwards, they definitely use MSG. The aftertaste lingered for a while and the inside on the meat lacked flavor. Quick stop for a hum bow. &#160;Grab some BBQ pork skewers and take home to add to your homemade fried rice - if you can wait to take them home. Wish this place was closer to home. This place is legit. &#160;Although I think the owners are Cantonese, I was still able to communicate with them in Mandarin. &#160;And they are so nice! &#160;I asked the man working the counter what he recommended since I couldn't decide between the pork and chicken hom baos, and he said to get the char sieu hom bao. &#160;His reasoning was "pork is better than chicken, therefore this one is the best." &#160;That made me LOL. &#160;We ended up getting both because that's just how we roll. &#160;They are so different and both are delicious in their own way. &#160;I honestly would not be able to choose between the two if/when I come back. &#160;The dough on the chicken hom bao was thicker but the filling was generous. &#160;The chicken was spiced with peppers and other wondrous seasonings and the chicken was fatty and tender. &#160;The pork hom bao, on the other hand, was sweeter and the meat inside tasted like it was marinated in alcohol. &#160;The bao to meat ratio was better in the pork hom bao, but seriously, both were fantastic.I only took a star off because I think it's pricey relative to Asian prices. &#160;But it's still really good and pretty much a must-have if you're in the area. Mee Sum is essential to any trip to Pike Place. The barbecue pork hum bao is hands down the best thing down there especially for the measly $2.50 it costs. I can't speak for much else though the bite of the chicken hum bao I got off my GF was good. Every trip downtown requires a stop there. I've never been a big fan of bao. &#160;The chicken hom bao here is probably better than others, but it doesn't blow me away and I was a little surprised at how greasy it was. &#160;This place is as down to earth as it gets. &#160;Food on display on shelves and in steamers, workers cooking in the background and a somewhat harried employee up front exchanging cash for steaming food in paper bags. &#160;But I *love* the steamed dumplings here! &#160;Eating them when they're fresh is like heaven, but steaming them again to eat at home works too. &#160;Not too doughy wrappers, lots of pork with a hint of ginger. &#160;Lovely stuff. &#160;On top of it all, it's cheap! &#160;$5.50 gets you 6 large dumplings and that's more than a meal for me! &#160;It's almost worth it braving the weekend parking in Pike Place just to pick up a bag to take home with me for lunch alone. &#160;Almost. &#160;I suppose that would depend on how hungry I was. &#160;;) Takes me back to when i was a little girl...eating the seasame balls, steam pork buns and sticky rice.The location and the set-up of the place even reminds me of a store front in Taipei, open and expose so you can truly see what they are making. &#160;I got a couple of seasame balls, one (LARGE) steam pork bun and sticky rice with pork. &#160;I can tell you that after eating my steam pork bun (which is a large portion), I was full but I must have the seasame ball stuffed with sweet red beans and it was worth stuffing my face!Now the sticky rice that was wrapped in leaf I wan't too impress. &#160;Perhaps I grew up with the rice being less sticky and more brown. &#160;The meat was one large chuck in the middle of the bun and there was a egg yolk which is new to me. &#160;I'm used to hae the meat shredded and distribute through out the sticky rice bun (if that makes any sense) but the flavor was good though. &#160;Just don't think I would get it again. &#160;As for the steam pork bun and the seasame balls, I would get in a heart beat! I didn't plan to come to Mee Sum, but I couldn't pass up the chance when I saw 6 Chinese people rolling fresh buns in this small little shop.The BBQ pork bun is huge... but it's also more than 2x pricier than the average BBQ pork bun. While it was good, it was not the best &#160;- you have to enjoy large chopped onions in the meat mixture. Also, the bread fell apart easily, and I prefer a chewier and more sugar glazed bun.Lung Fung (in SF), you still have my heart when it comes to BBQ pork buns. The hombow seemed a little overrated when I first got. Too much bun, not enough bread.But as I slowly ate it, the pork filling became more noticeable. And more tasty. Yet, I was still left with a bit of an underwhelming feeling.Is it worth it as street food? Sure. But it's not the BEST THING EVER as some have proclaimed either. I have not been here in years. I recently starting working downtown right next to Pike Place Market. I was out today trying to think of somewhere for lunch. As I passed outside the market I remember one day when I tried a hombow many years ago from the same place. Luckily I found it quickly and ordered two humbows. One was sweet curry and the other BBQ pork. The lady was very nice and gave me change for my big bill (it was all I had on me). Tthe I took the rolls and headed down to the water front. Definitely an awesome lunch break. Love this place, usually stop for sesame balls w/ red bean filling when we are in the area. &#160;Today they were sooooooo oily it was almost weird. &#160;I will be back but wanted to mention my surprise when they didn't rock like they usually do. Worst Salty Fish Fried rice ever. But awesome pork chop and bubble teas. Enough said. Wow, I'm shocked at the rating for this bakery....like really wow!This bakery is extremely a tourist rip-off location, and the food is so-so. Stream buns, were dry, and the baked buns wasn't hot.Finally verdict: Pricy and not good. perfectly located at pikes place market. cheap, fresh and ono! im from hawaii, so hombow is the closest thing to manapua that i can get. their baked hombows are nice and warm with a thin crust on the outside. i usually get the pork which is a no-miss choice. can be fatty, but thats how pork is, its the luck of the draw really. they also have pork sticks that are cheap and have big chunks of bbq pork with pineapples. ive had hombow at a few places, but everytime im at pikes ill end up here. This review is only for the BBQ pork hum bow.The bread is fluffy, delicious, and yeasty. There's not much filling, but I didn't mind. I found the flavor and texture of it to be a little off-putting. For $2.75 after tax it's definitely worth trying if you're in the area. The toasted BBQ pork bun was great. It was fresh and toasty. The meat to bread proportion was good and it was $2.75 with tax. No complaints here. I don't think it's the best I've had but it's among the best. I expected to snack on some other goodies from nearby stands but it was surprisingly filling. holy crab rangoon batman. Best thing ever. mandatory stop every trip to the market. Giant Sesame Balls, incredibly flakey curry hum bows, decadent bbq... I just laugh at all the tourists who elect to eat in the other shops. Price has gone up since my parents started taking me here 20 years ago, but the food is better than I remember each trip. Maybe it's the salty air, but I love Mee Sum Pastry! on the street that fronts pikes market. &#160;pork bun was fluffy, soft, and had a natural sweet/savory taste. &#160;filling has chunks of meat, so it actually tastes and feels like meat. Steamed BBQ buns...very good. wow, $2.50 for a bbq pork bun is very expensive. it was also very disappointing. it was not a very traditional bbq pork bun at all. the texture and consistency of the bao was just weird and too doughy. unless it was suppose to be like that, since they were specially called a humbow and not a bun. Wait...hold on a sec... I never wrote a review for this place! Mee Sum Pastry IS my childhood. So many days after school my carpool used to swing by here and pick up some amazing hombow. Sooo good and cheap! The staff is super nice and a lot of times at the end of the day will cut deals on some of the items. Baked or steamed I love all of the different buns and guarantee you can't go wrong. This is a great option for a quick treat if you are down at the market. Best pot stickers ever! I once spent a week downtown taking a class for work, and got pot stickers from Mee Sum every day but one, and on that day I wished I had gotten the pot stickers too. Douse them in hot oil and the sweet vinegar they have there. So good. Humbao=Noms. &#160;Perfect to nibble on while wandering around the market. THIS IS MY FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT. The Humbow is beyond amazing. A great place to bring friends from out of the country. BBQ pork hombow. Huge at a reasonable price. Eat this after you try all the clam chowder around the area. Snack time. Love the BBQ pork humbows. The homemade fortune cookies are awesome too. Great if you are looking for something quick and good in the market. Seems like i've been eating these since i've been born, i love the curry and bbq hombow. This is a staple at the Pike Place Market
All I had here were cha sao bao (BBQ pork buns), and I was starving so they tasted pretty good and were super fast. But I've had better. $4.50 for two, and they were kind of salty and doughy. Once again, as a New Yorker, I hate to admit to the fact that I had the BEST cha shu bao (aka &#160;baked pork bun) in Seattle. &#160;The pork bun was freshly baked. &#160;The bread was warm, soft and chewy. The roasted pork bun blew my mind. &#160;The price was cheap. &#160;Friendly service. &#160;Awesome buns!Damn shame Mee Sum Pastry is in Seattle. &#160;You will never starve while walking through Pike Place Market. Maybe because my friend and I went later in the day, but the bread could have been warmer and fluffier. Ohhh.......so good..... If you want a quick bun or a skewer of BBQ pork, this is it. &#160;They also have shrimp chips which I absolutely love. &#160;Pot stickers are also good, but need some soy sauce. &#160;The BBQ pork hom bow is really really good, and probably my favorite thing here. &#160;The baked version (golden brown outside) also has onions mixed in with the BBQ pork, and the steamed version (amazingly soft white bread) is just BBQ pork. &#160;There is definitely more bread than meat in the steamed version, which I would normally complain about, but this bread is just so soft and supple you really end up not caring. &#160;They are always consistently good, and I've been coming here for about ten years now. &#160;So i'll say that this place is a must when you come to the market. &#160;mmmm... can't wait for more!~ Whenever I'm close to Pike's Market, I dream of BBQ Pork or Curry Hom Bow. &#160;As I've only had the Hom Bow here, I can't really say anything more about their other offerings. &#160;The Hom Bow is huge! &#160;Mostly they've been super filled inside with your choice of meat and they're always warm. &#160;Make sure that you have cash so that you have a quick transaction.Yum! My bf and I have been going here for their hombows for years. They are the closest thing you can get to a manapua from Hawaii. He loves them, I always just wish I had a manapua when I'm eating them. They can be really fatty which grosses me out. They also have BBQ pork sticks which are tasty but yet again can be really fatty. Fair Chinese pastries and goodies. Have to say that if it's Chinese goodies that you crave... go to the local source - International District. Lots of little places to try. I do so enjoy me a snack here. I love the pork buns, the red bean pastry and the barbeque. However, I don't understand them and they don't understand me. &#160;We always attempt to communicate, but always revert back to pointing at what we want. Despite that they do provide friendly service, are speedy and the prices are affordable. I also believe they ship some of the products available from what I remember. Their hom bao is one of the best things I've ever eaten! This thing alone is worth heading to Pike Street Market. Trust. Yum cheap cha shu baos! &#160;Coming from California they were REALLY good, especially when they were made fresh and warm.I also tried the zong zi (Sticky rice with filling wrapped in bamboo leaves) but it left me feeling sick. &#160;I'm used to the one filled with just pork, but this one had egg yolk, shrimp, pork and lotus seeds. &#160;Bleh wasn't that great, should have stuck to the basic baos. Okay...today there were 2... low cost and fun Pike place on the go food!!!xoxox Nom nom, slurp, mmmmmm! &#160;Oh, sorry, I was enjoying one of Mee Sum's lucious hum bow in my dreams. &#160;This is our go-to place every time we are at the Market. &#160;The bun is sweet and soft with the center so tasty and moist. &#160;But, that's just the bbq pork humbow. &#160;There are pot stickers, buns and cookies, OH MY! &#160;All their selections are wonderful, but, being the purist that I am, I always return home to my favorite, BBQ Pork Hom Bow. &#160;At $2.29, it's a very inexpensive snack or light meal. &#160;So, this is a must-have if you are at the Market. &#160;Nom nom slurp, mmmm - I'm returning to my hum bow dream! Located in the heart of Pike Place Market, this is one of my favorite places to grab a snack while walking around and doing some shopping. My favorite item is the BBQ pork stick, but often have a hard time deciding between that or the BBQ pork bun, crab rangoon, shrimp purse, and pot stickers. Take your pick, you won't be disappointed.With the high volume of traffic in the market, you may have to wait a couple minutes to get your food, but they do get through the line quickly. There are also plenty of things to keep you occupied while you wait like people watching or salivating over all the different options.Quality food, fast service, and great prices all equals a must visit destination while visiting the market.
I just had my birthday party there, and the drinks are sooo strong. &#160;It's INSANE. &#160;How would you like a rum and coke, but drop the coke? &#160;The night started innocently enough, but the next thing I know, I'm face down in a fried rice eating contest and throwing rice at my friend. &#160;Then, I'm face down on the floor underneath the table. &#160;Then, I'm lying down on the ground outside. &#160;Whaaat?In general, the lounge is very laid back and usually quiet and comfortable. &#160;But the booze is so strong, that you wouldn't really want to go there for a casual drink. &#160;Were it not for the insanely strong drinks, I would picture myself coming here regularly with a group of friends, because of the comfortable feel of the place. &#160;But it has never worked out that way. &#160;There are Christmas lights swinging from the ceiling, which gives the place a very boozy (in a just-tipsy, warm way), and slightly debauched but not too much, feel to it. &#160;I think the food is good too, although not excellent. &#160;I recommend the fried tofu with garlic sauce. &#160;I have been coming to this place for years, and it's like my Chinese home. I honestly think the cooks here are comedic geniuses and they're pulling the sheets over anyone who orders food. &#160;The food is a laughable, downright ludicrous attempt to pass off what they serve as something remotely edible.You never expect Chinese take-out to move mountains, but you should at least expect some level of consistency among the staples (fried rice, chow mein, Mongolian beef, etc.) between Chinese restaurants. &#160;I'm just bitter because I was expecting to gorge on some no-frills staples after a 4:20 session. &#160;If I couldn't even stomach eating, let alone looking at their food with a major case of the munchies, that should tell you something. Great "basic" Chinese food, i.e. Almond chicken, moo goo gai pan, etc, you get my meaning.The real reason to visit is the bar and the drinks! &#160;One word....POW!!! &#160;Mixer? &#160;What mixer? &#160;Stick to the basics, no fancy shmancy stuff. &#160;I think if you'd order a "Sex on the beach" you might just get that!Typical American-Chinese food establishment circa 1970.... "Best Chinese in Wallingford" the flyer proudly proclaims. Yeah, that's cause it's the ONLY Chinese in Wallingford. I have eaten here a few times and every menu item is either deep fried, greasy, covered in sauce or a combination of those three. I think this place survives on the alcohol sales alone. If you order a drink that doen't have the ingredients in the name, i.e. Jack &amp; Coke, Vodka &amp; Cran, etc....don't expect it to be what you wanted. The drinks are 90% well alcohol with a splash of mixer. If you want cheap stiff drinks, then this is the place for you! Eat the food! &#160;Resplendent in the mouth-watering vapors that will send your senses sky-rocketing into an orbital zone only known to the truly impaired, one must languish in the torporific and lassitudinous dusky dark of the moon temple in order to get ones Buzz Aldrin waxing or waning a gibbous inebriate.
Great Banh Mi "Vietnamese Sandwiches" in Lake City. &#160;I couldn't believe my luck today. Heading towards another sandwich location, I noticed a small business establishment that has changed a number of times, with a sign in the window that read, "Banh Mi." &#160; I went in and the owner looked up from his Ipad which doubles as a credit card machine, greeted me with a smile and friendly "hello". &#160;Seems like a small thing, but if you have ever frequented some of the deli's, your order can seem as if it is an imposition. The owner at the Lake City Bakery had a nice friendly attitude.You get good, fast service, a nice conversation and a fantastic Vietnamese sandwich. The atmosphere was pleasant, nice upbeat and modern cafe style furniture. &#160;I normally drive many miles south in Seattle to get a decent Banh Mi. I will no longer have to take the long drive again, nor will I have to push my way to the front of the line, hoping the cashier decides to take my order. &#160;I never take the unfriendly service personally because they are just trying to get you a fresh sandwich quick, no matter who you are. &#160;There is not much about Vietnamese food that I don't like, but I really like the sandwiches. &#160;The Lake City Bakery past my initial test. &#160;The Viet/French baguette was fresh (crackly crust and light), pork was seasoned well, the shredded pickled carrots and daikon, fresh cucumber, jalapeno and cilantro were perfect. &#160;I will certainly become a regular at the Lake City Bakery. &#160;If the sandwiches stay fresh, reasonably priced and the service remains good I am confident this business will stay! Oh Yum Yum!SITREPI love when a good "bakery" and "coffee shop" come together, and I have to say BRAVO for the good people at Lake City Bakery for adding significant deliciousness to our Lake City community.SETUPAlmost around for a year, this bakery makes some of the best fusion and eclectic offerings that I've seen. &#160;From sandwiches to specialty breads to pastries, you are not going to find a bad item in the lot.My mom - an avid blue cheese fan ever since I can remember - was pleasantly surprised when I picked her up a loaf of their Blue Cheese bread. &#160;Like Asiago bread, cheese breads seem to be coming out in abundant varieties -whether at this bakery or others - and for me that is an OUTSTANDING culinary treat!COFFEE STOPAnd though not really known for it's coffee, this can still be a great stop now to get a java dose - I love the espresso - and chill for a bit, while munching on some cake or pastries.THE LOWDOWNLake City Bakery is a most pleasant stop for baked good deliciousness! Popped in on a lazy Sunday for a cup of tea and ended up getting a sandwich and pastry along with my drink.Great little cafe. &#160;Love the sitting area. They went with a really simple contemporary look which is a break from the Starbucks-esqe look nearly every other coffee shop goes for. &#160;Super friendly staff. &#160;A nice little menu that offers really good pastries and a selection of soups and sandwiches, smoothies and bubble tea, and coffee shop stand-byes.The sandwich was outstanding. &#160;Excellent flavor, the delicious crusty french bun I love, and fresh abundant toppings. &#160;Their pastry selection includes European, American, and Asian choices. &#160;I went for the croissant and wasn't disappointed. &#160;I forgot to ask if all the pastries were made in-house but judging by the mixing equipment visible in the back room I suspect that they are .I hope this place sticks around, I might just have to make it a regular stop on my lazy Sunday afternoon wanderings. I was battling insomnia last night and decided to do some searches on Yelp.I stumbled upon Lake City Bakery as i was searching for top rated Banh Mi and Pho restaurants. &#160;I read all the previous reviews and made the decision that i was going to give this place a try today 4/18/2012. &#160;I worked through lunch today in an effort to "save" myself for the much raved upon Banh Mi. &#160;It nearly killed me. &#160;:)Chris and Jeanie(sp) were so very hospitable as i entered their place. &#160;I decided to try the pork banh mi. &#160;A few minutes laterJeanie provides me with a pretty hefty sandwich. &#160;Surely they mistakenly gave me a large sandwich instead of a regular sized one. &#160;But they only have one size and this was it for $4.75!!!. &#160;The sandwich was so good. &#160;I mean damn good. &#160;I am originally from Houston, where there is a huge Vietnamese community, with exceptional food. &#160; The Banh Mi at Lake City Bakery was the best i've had since i lived in Houston. &#160;(15 years ago) Very tasty bah mi sandwich and under $4! Fresh fruit smoothies are very good and the pastries? Delicious! Great Asian Fusion bakery in Lake City... I always stop by after getting off the bus at LCW and 125th.  &#160;Chris and Jeannie are awesome, and bake all of their amazing pastries and bread in-house. &#160;Their Banh-Mi are delicious and authentic, &#160;and I can't express how glad I am that Lake City finally has a decent BUBBLE TEA joint!!! &#160;I'm picky about bubble tea and the places where the only option is "slush" just don't cut it. Can't wait to try one of those killer cinnamon rolls one of these weekends...
The minute i walked in, the staff was totally accommodating, and genuine- &#160;Our waitress was absolutely fabulous. We ordered the pan roasted chicken and the pork ragout with spaghetti, paired with the tempernillo wine, and for dessert the lemon cream with brown sugar shortbread and a glass of sherry.I would have to say that the ambiance and service will bring me back again. Not that the food wasn't delicious (because it WAS) but I enjoy being made to feel at home, so I'll be back.Great place for a date night or dinner with friends. I found this amazing place on a little website called Yelp. &#160;I had just installed the app on my new IPhone and decided to test it out. &#160;I had lived 5 minutes from this place for almost 2 years and never knew about it! &#160;From start to finish the service and food was excellent. &#160;I personally love it when your waiter/waitress is blunt about what to order and so after giving her my two options she immediately told me the chicken wrapped in prosciutto was the way to go. &#160;And it sure didn't disappoint! &#160;We ordered the cured meats &amp; cheeses for appetizers and all but licked the plates. &#160;We thought that might be socially unacceptable. &#160;My cocktail was perfect (wish I could remember the name but grapefruit vodka was in there).Now on to my favorite part of any meal, the dessert. &#160;I'll be honest. &#160;The names of the desserts weren't all that appetizing-sounding when I viewed the menu online but it just goes to show you should never judge a book by its cover.We ordered 1 of every dessert, which is totally the way to go because all of them were equally delicious. &#160;Most surprising was the eggnog semifreddo that just sounded strange to me but ended being a favorite.You're missing out if you haven't tried this place yet! Our experience here was excellent. We arrived early for our reservation and were still seated immediately. This was at 6pm on a Thursday. The environment and ambiance was great, darker with a little tealight on our table. There are tables or you can sit at the bar and watch the cooking action and talk to the chefs. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful in answering our questions. We ordered a wide variety of dishes including, the cheese platter, the celery and potato soup, the ribs, the lasagne, and the chicken. Everything was cooked to perfection and just the right temperature. The green beans were crunchy and very tasty. The only complaint was the noodles on the lasagne were very well done so there wasn't much chew to that dish. It sort of melted in your mouth. I wish we could have stuck around for dessert but we were very filled by the portions they offer. Al around a wonderful experience and one we are eager to repeat soon! Loved Crow!!! &#160;Can't believe I have never been here before.Came here last weekend with a big group. &#160;My bf and I ordered a few of items (cheese plate, bread salad, lasagna and proscuitto chicken) to share. &#160;Everything was awesome. &#160;The cheese plate was great! &#160;Good cheese, with nice rosemary crackers. &#160;The bread salad was wonderful with grilled huge pieces of bread, arugula and tomatoes. &#160;The lasagna was pretty good, but nothing spectacular...but the chicken - to die for. &#160;Very juicy! &#160;So, so good! &#160;I also tried a piece of the rib eye which was ok...but the chicken was what I remember the most. &#160;The ambience was warm and gorgeous. &#160;Service was attentive. &#160;I really enjoyed my dinner here. &#160;Can't wait to go back! We really enjoyed our experience here. &#160;We went in early on a Friday evening without a reservation, hopeful at trying a new spot. &#160;They found a table for us and were lovely about ensuring we were comfortable. &#160;I enjoyed the lasagna while my husband had the fish of the day. &#160;His fish was under cooked in a two inch section which was a bit of a bummer. &#160;It would be our only reason for four stars instead of five. &#160;We also had green beans which I am thinking about still today and a great salad. &#160;The chocolate mousse cake was a delight too. &#160; &#160;The service was wonderful and for us, what makes or breaks a meal. &#160;Will go back for sure! I love the portion to value ratio and the food is very yummy. I had the gnocchi and it was amazing, and the soup of the day (Celery Root and Potato) was balanced very well with a great texture. I really liked the space and service was very attentive. But, my favorite is the $20 wine bottle special, that is a great deal. I can't wait to try this place again sometime. I came here during restaurant week. Crow was one of the two restaurants that I had visited twice during my 11-week project in Seattle back in 2006 (It's one of those foodie thing not to repeat restaurants while on the road unless there is a good reason to). I remember having the seared scallops and the rack of lamb on its menu. I was keen on returning to see how the place has changed. Interior-wise, everything remains as I remembered. Although the menu was very different than I had remembered, so much so that I wonder if there was a chef/ownership change. Gone were the big protein items (no more rack of lamb) and there were more pasta dishes. I had the fried green tomato for appetizer. Incidentally, I've always considered fried green tomato as a southern dish (brings back memories from when I did a project in Columbus, GA) &#160;so it was interesting to find this dish in a Seattle restaurant. The dish was very nicely executed. For entree, I had the prosciutto-wrapped chicken with spring beans. Once again, nicely executed but lacking the surprise elements. For dessert I had the chocolate mousse cake, which was pretty decent. Overall, I thought it was ok value for the price. Although I have to say for the same price level, there are other Seattle restaurants that may give you more to write home about. Unusual name for a restaurant and I would say appropriate name considering the atmosphere!It didn't blow my mind but overall it was OKGood serviceReasonable priceGood food although not my favorite Fancy, dark, semi-pricey, semi-uppity place to get drinks and/or food.They make the best spaghetti evar: perfectly cooked noodles, yummy sauce, big tender chunks of wild boar (what?), and big squares of Parmesan. I wanted it to be 5 stars but it's definitely not from my experience. I sat at the chef's bar since I was dining solo. My waiter was a zero personality wise but I don't know if it was his fault, maybe he's just boring.I ordered the pinot which was pretty good and thought it would go well with the ribeye that I ordered. I specifically ordered it "Rare, very rare." and watched the gent cook it thinking the whole time "You're burning it, you're cooking it for too long, etc." while I sipped my pinot. Guess what! I was right and it came out slightly rare to medium rare on one side and medium rare to medium on the other... I was hungry and didn't bother sending it back.The mushrooms, onions and peas that came with it were all quite good but I couldn't understand why he poured the sauce over my ribeye and had it floating in sauce. A ribeye is supposed to be one of the most flavorful steaks and I don't think it needed a swim to accomplish this.I wavered between 3 and 4 stars but it's definitely better than A-OK and it is close to me being a fan so I rolled with the 4 stars. I would definitely come back but next time I'll be sending my overcooked steak back or ordering something else.Also, clean the table mounted can opener, it looks disgusting on the customer's side at the end of the bar! Yum, yum, yum, yum, YUM!I honestly don't even remember what I ate here, but I know we left dinner full and salivating in recent memory.What stood out to me, however, was our incredible waiter.He carded me when I ordered my wine, and much to my dismay, I opened my purse to discover I had left my ID in the bag I had been using during the day. I *never* forget things like that and was mortified, to say the least. The waiter, bless his heart, explained that since he had asked, he couldn't un-ask and very sadly couldn't serve me alcohol until I proved my age.He was probably as beet red with embarrassment about this as I was...Knowing I would need my ID later in the night, I called my boyfriend and asked him to drive over with my wallet. Flash forward, I have my ID and finally am able to show it to our waiter. All through the process, he apologized again and again, saying that he wished he hadn't asked, of course I look old enough, etc, etc.That glass of wine had at least two and a half servings in it. Oooohhhh, and it was worth the wait! We had wanted to try something different. We loved this restaurant. It was easy to get a reservation the night of. We had great service, great food and a great experience. Had a really great dinner at Crow on Saturday night. Four of us, one with an onion allergy, two vegetarians, and me -- well, I can eat and do eat anything as long as it's not still moving. &#160;The point I'm trying to get at is that everyone enjoyed their meal. Even though they have a very small menu (hooray for that!), everyone found something they wanted and enjoyed and they could accommodate the onion issue despite the ubiquitous-ness of onions these days (if the dish doesn't have it elsewhere, throw a handful of it on top). We went from there to the Rep -- a pleasant 15 minute walk -- and returned a couple of hours later for dessert. They remembered us and promptly seated us at a table (though ordinarily they wouldn't give up a table for dessert until later in the evening). The desserts were wonderful. The lemon custard/pudding (can't remember what they called it) was tangy and light and nuanced and . . . we'll be back for more! If I wasn't referred here by the hotel staff, I would not have picked this restaurant due to it's location. Located on a quiet street with very limited parking, the restaurant looked extremely empty. As I walked in the door, the smell of different foods and wine made my stomach growl. The interior is very nice and unpretentious. The service was great and the food was awesome. I would definitely go back again. This restaurant smelled great the moment I stepped into the door and the food lived up to the aroma. Beef rib eye was tender and perfectly cooked. Bib leaf and apple salad was fresh and flavorful. Grilled manchego a tasty treat. We sat at the kitchen bar and watched two organized and meticulous chefs work in concert. Cozy atmosphere, delicious dinner, friendly staff. I AM going back. Definitely make a reservation, this place was packed, for good reason. Service was excellent, very attentive. Our water glasses were never empty and our waiter was friendly, helpful, and very attractive (never hurts). It's Restaurant week so they were all busting their butts but everyone still seemed very happy to help us. We started off with the fried green tomatoes, which had a heavenly tomato jam on top. Next was the chicken wrapped in prosciutto with green beans, we wanted to lick the sauce off the plate but it would have been unseemly. For dessert was a goat cheese cheesecake. I did not like the fig sauce it was served on top of, I think it had whiskey in it. But I just pushed the sauce away and feasted on the cheesecake, which was incredibly smooth, not too sweet, and made me want to moan. My friend had the green apple ice cream, which was surprisingly excellent. Green apple flavored anything is hard to pull off without seeming 'artificial' but they did a great job with it, it was served with a caramel sauce and crunchy nuts that really provided a fascinating taste experience. FANTASTIC Meal here. Will be back soon. Ordered the salmon and have been dreaming about it ever since! I had a great experience here on Saturday night. &#160;We were with a large group of approximately 20 people. &#160;Service was good, food was good, and the ambiance was nice. &#160;I was impressed that they were able to bring the entrees to all of us within a few minutes of each other.I ordered the Lasagna and a side order of the Green Beans. &#160;Both were good. &#160;The Lasagna is a generous portion and a great value for $16. Crow is a no frills establishment with a menu of a few items. However, this is a place that prepares these few items with perfection. I was conflicted between 3 and 4 start, although everything we had was flavorful and well executed, it didn't wow me enough to put Crow on my "I must come here again soon" list.The ambiance of this restaurant is warm, inviting and casually upscale. Staff was attentive and cordial. As I mentioned earlier, the menu will not overwhelm you with selections, but pretty much anything you order will be very satisfying. Before we made reservations, I looked on Yelp and determined that we had to order their signature Pan Roasted Chicken. I can always trust my fellow Yelpers, the dish did not disappoint. Perfectly tender, juicy chicken flesh, with salty prosciutto on top to create a harmony of flavor, accompanied by sauteed green beans. Other sampling included: - Fresh oysters: buttery, creamy, delicious - Fried Green Tomatoes: Crispy batter on the outside, tender sweet and slightly tangy tomato on the inside with a slice of fresh mozzarella on top. - Fish of the Day - Halibut and Prawn Stew. I love it when seafood is cooked just to the point of the tender flesh changing color. Stewed in a house tomato base.Great bottle of malbec to round up the meal.P.S. One big suggestion: something has to be done about the floor surface. The polished concrete of the restaurant is a death trap for ladies in heels. It's like an ice ring, very dangerous. I watched a few women struggle with the floor, including myself. Great atmopshere and delcious food! The gnocci was fantastic and my friend who had the lasagna loved it! I would definently go back! Went here on a sunday night and had their 4 course special! &#160;Food was amazing!! &#160;I had the lasagna and the wine pairing was perfect!! &#160;Waitress was great too!! muscles and clams!pan roasted chicken!everything is delicious.the menu changes often though.dining alone? they have an awesome back bar where you can watch the chefs work the kitchen. that way you don't have to and stare at your iphone at a table for one. I've been here twice in the last two weeks and will definitely be making it a regular spot. Menu is somewhat limited, but what they offer is good. On one occasion I had the pan roasted chicken as my main - it is enormous and very, very good. Excellent flavors and a high quality piece of meat; it made me really want to see them do quail or squab as I am sure they'd do a great job. The second time I went I had the crab and avocado salad. Also a generous portion (I think if you did three full courses here you wouldn't be able to move afterward) with some of the best butterhead lettuce I have ever had. Dressing left something to be desired, but it was good nonetheless. MMMMmmmmm! I've been wanting to try Crow for years and FINALLY made it in. Started with the fava bean and english pea bruschetta (with fresh mozzarella and cherry tomatoes) and it was deeeeelish. I'm super stoked that fava beans and sweet peas are so "in" right now. Just sayin'. For entrees, my boyfriend had the ribeye topped with blue cheese on a cucumber tomato salad... he didn't share much with me but the bite I did have was tasty. I had the pork tenderloin, and it was cooked to perfection! Never in my life have I has such succulent, tender pork. It came with a corn/pepper/arugula salad. Good and good for you. I was too full for dessert, but will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu, and their sweets. Oh yes, and our server was quite nice as well. Solid choice for dinner. &#160;The tenderloin was cooked perfectly with a hill of green beans and mashed potatoes. &#160;The braised lamb shank was even better as the tenderness melts in your mouth with an accompaniment of buttery, soft polenta. &#160;The dining environment was nicely laid out and seemed to be a date friendly place. &#160;Crow is the standard I look for in moderate Seattle restaurants and prices are reasonable to boot. I have heard about Crow from several people and had been really wanting to try the place. &#160;My first visit did not disappoint! &#160;Stopped in after a concert at McCaw Hall, at about 9:30. &#160;We were able to be seated right away, and the service was great. &#160;We weren't too hungry so we shared a salad and an entree. &#160;The chicken was soooo good. &#160;It was incredibly moist. &#160;The waiter didn't give us any 'attitude' about us sharing dishes, either, which was refreshing. &#160;Had a couple glasses of wine, and it was a great end to the evening. &#160;I would go back anytime! One of our favorites. &#160;Always consistent.Great meal for the money! Loved the food and atmosphere of this place. The area of town it is in is a little sketchy and we had a homeless lady stare at us through the window which was a bit weird. Overall, if you are trying to find a great place to take a date or a new foody adventure, try it out.
Today, I NEEDED a cookie. &#160;I had planned to head over to Specialty to get some of their fantastic cookies (see my review of the San Francisco branch), but due to circumstances beyond my control, I was unable to make it over there.So, I suppose Essential Bakery Cafe was already doomed since they're not Specialty, which is what I REALLY wanted. &#160;However, to be fair, I actually really like the atmosphere of Essential Bakery Cafe, and I had high hopes for my Plan B Cookie Run.The woman behind the counter seemed a bit distracted (or high?), but took my order and got it right. &#160;I decided to order a ham sandwich in addition to my sweet treats, since I figured having only cookies for lunch while breastfeeding a baby is not exactly responsible parenting. &#160;I watched as my sandwich was put on the "order up" area several minutes later. &#160;I waited.And... waited. &#160;Hello?Eventually, she called out "Bert?" &#160;I went over to the counter and smiled. &#160;She said, "Yes?" &#160;This is the woman who, not 10 minutes ago, took my order and WROTE MY NAME on the order slip. &#160;She clearly had no idea who I was. &#160;So, I talked her into giving me the sandwich (she had also not given me a receipt to prove it was mine), and my baby and I were on our way.And, then, as I crested the top of the hill, pushing my heavy stroller full of baby, I realized... she had not given me the @#$^% cookie! &#160;Dammit dammit dammit! &#160;I knew I'd pass out if I had to climb the hill again on so little sleep and with such a heavy load. &#160;Besides, I still had no receipt.It was not to be.On the upside, I got a soggy, mediocre $7 sandwich for $10. &#160;Boo. Essential Bakery is too rich for my blood.My wife and I each had an omelet (we didn't add any extra toppings); she also had a caramel latte and I had the basic drip. We walked out having spent almost $30. The meal tasted good &#160;enough but did not warrant the price tag; the portion was just too small and the flavor was actually a bit bland for the omelet and potatoes. Also, they did not have any gluten free offerings from the bakery, which really sucked (I'm not sure if they normally carry GF options though). Concerning the restaurant facilities, the place is quite clean and open with lots of seating and big windows to let in the natural light. They also offer free WiFi. Despite this, it got crowded really fast; this was a problem only because it got so loud that it was hard to study, which was the main reason for giving this place a go. I ended up feeling more like I was in a restaurant than a cafe. Still, I won't count the crowds against EBC, but I feel that it should be noted for anyone looking for a place to study or read that the large open design of the cafe makes for large, loud crowds.I attempted to make up for all this by getting three free refills of my drip (which was definitely the best part of the meal), but I won't be making a trip back here any time soon. There are far too many cheaper places that offer a tastier selection of coffee and a better atmosphere for studying. Great neighborhood cafe. My favorite items there are the grilled sandwiches (the reuben with pastrami or the Rachel with turkey), the fresh loaves of bread (Rosemary goes great with beef stews while the Columbia is crusty with a hint of sour - good with butter and soup), and the French toast which is a decadant bread pudding. Their vegetarian soups, crepes, omelets and pastries are ok, and their desserts are pretty, but expensive for what you get - would go elsewhere for cakes, cupcakes, cookies, etc. I have to say, I was a little critical in my past reviews of Essential Bakery. I had found a lot of the staff very snotty and obnoxious. Well, they must have gotten rid of those folks because my recent experiences have been great. Very friendly, flexible, easy going. No attitude. And thanks for getting the second register! The ham and cheese croissants still are the best! Thanks! Kinda spendy but SOOOOOO good! &#160;Make sure to ask for basil on your breakfast sandwich. &#160;And for peat's sake get the hot chocolate with whipped cream!!!!!! Would give less than 1 star if possible. Visited again after my last bitchfest and this time I used the bathroonm which was disgusting. If this place didn't rake it in I would be easier on them, but considering how busy it is, I feel no mercy. Never will go here again or buy their products off the shelf. I feel like this place is having an identity crisis. It can't decide if it's a local version of Panera or a bakery coffee shop. Or maybe I just need to recalibrate my expectations.I really wanted to like studying here, but the place seems more conducive to lunch meetings. It's really not a place to plant your laptop and get some tasks checked off your list.The traffic at this location is predictable. If you visit around the lunch hours, you'll be greeted with congestion. The place peaks around 12-1pm and then dies slowly until it's practically empty around 4-5pm. The building carries voices very well and there were times where I was yelling across the table so that my study buddy could hear me. The furniture is dense and contributes to the crowding of the cafe.This location does not provide WiFi, but there are some networks around the area that provide service. It's unreliable, so I wouldn't go here if you were doing something internet heavy.As for the food, the Mazurka bars are always delicious and wholesome (see photo). I also had a Peach dessert tart, which was made of the tastiest shortbread. I approve.Major bonus: BOTTOMLESS COFFEE. I could imagine bringing a book here, getting comfortable on the couch, and reading for a couple of hours.At this point, I'm ambivalent about this place because I'm not sure they know what kind of place they want to be: coffee shop/bakery/study spot? Sandwich shop/bakery/meeting place? It's worth a visit, but a return is questionable. Friendly associates behind the counter greet you honestly when you arrive, which only makes you want to stay longer in the presence of such beautiful and tantalizing scents abound!The baked goods here are lovely, though I wish they used puff pastry instead of tart dough for their quiches... And the sandwiches! Oh I'm a total sandwich snob so when I say they are good and creative I mean it. My flanksteak sandwich was a total party in my mouth with tingling horseradish and perfectly marinated flanksteak as well as crispy accompaning vegetables all stuffed between two pieces of beautiful peasent bread with some of the best crumb I've ever seen.My only dislike for this place is their chai, morning glory is my least fave variety and its all they have so sadly I have to go elsewhere's for that. But they do have a great selection of lightly fizzed beverages and juice works juices to keep me happy in the place of more palatable chai. Really not worth the visit. &#160;I was hosting a friend and we wanted a bite of lunch in Madison Park. &#160;I hadn't tried Essential Bakery Cafe, and thought it looked like a decent spot. &#160;I was wrong. &#160;The experience began with very disjointed and not particularly friendly service at the counter. &#160;They didn't particularly seem to care that we were there. &#160;We took a seat at the outside tables, which would have been nice enough had they not been accented with several hanging baskets of dead plants! &#160;The sandwiches were ok, though not particularly tasty or plentiful in terms of serving portion. &#160;(The best part was the pickle.) &#160;And the salad was completely flavorless with giant hunks of greens/herbs which should have been pared down a bit to fit the serving size. &#160;Not a value for the price. &#160;Don't recommend or plan to return. As one of my coworkers likes to say, "This place gets so much of my money!" (In a good way...although we do wish the prices were a little bit cheaper)Although it is mainly due to convenience (Essential is downstairs from my workplace), the food and beverages here rarely disappoint. I tend to get nonfat lattes from here more than food, but the sandwiches and salads are absolutely fantastic....especially the caprese sandwich and the Pacific Northwest Salad. To die for! The food here tends to be &#160;healthy/organic as well.The staff are very friendly and down-to-earth as well. Lots of indoor seating, outdoor seating (when it's warm/not too cold outside), photography and/or paintings from local artists on the walls, and usually indie music playing. It's nice to work upstairs from such a great little bakery. :) To be fair I like to try a place at least 2-3 times before writing a review but this experience was such a let down I'm hoping someone will read this and help me understand what happened. I live in Wallingford and use to frequent that Essential Bakery location until I gave up bread (that latest a hot second). I'd grown accustomed to the yummy, gooey crusty-bread grilled cheese sandwiches at the Wallingford bakery and was craving one when I happened to be near the Madison location. The person I was with opted for a sandwich. Okay, this is what I got: 3 slices of processed cheese fresh from their plastic wrappers (they didn't even bother to try and melt the square edges of the cheese away to hide them!?) semi-melted between what looked like paper-thin Safeway wheat bread. Am I dreaming? Is this Seattle? One of the top restaurant cities in the country? How did I end up with dorm cafeteria-grade grilled cheese?! The person I was with did not fair much better; his soggy "Safeway-style" sandwich was underwhelming to say the least. The coffee and tea we had were decent but that's not so hard to pull off. The food deserved 1 star. The atmosphere and service however were much better hence my second star. I think I'm going to have nightmares about that grilled cheese. I recently moved into the madrona area and was dismayed to find that the Essential was the only quick coffee/breakfast joint within walking distance. &#160;It's overpriced, more than once i've received potatoes with my omelet that were not cooked all the way. &#160;The service was laughable, I've never had more rude or patronizing help behind a counter in my life. &#160;The breakfast sandwiches are bland, the mini desserts are nothing to write home about. &#160;The entire place disappoints me to no end. &#160;HOWEVER, after religiously returning for lack of other places to eat, I've found that there are two employees, a tall friendly brunette male with a slight beard, and a blond man with glasses, who deserve none of the wrath of this YELP review. &#160;they are the only reasons i didn't give essential 1 star. &#160;If you can get in on a day these two are working, and maybe don't order the potatoes, you'll bask in the mediocrity of this cafe. I have been to this bakery in Madison twice in 2 months and both times I have been met with extreme disappointment. All I ask from a bakery is freshness and if it's not fresh and ready to be purchased at their premium prices, it should be noted that the goods are not fresh (day old, etc). The Pugliese bread and almond croissants both times were old and stale. It angers me to pay such premium prices for stale bread and pastries! I will never partonize this bakery again. I will consider its other locations but the business owner(s) should take note of this.
I don't know what the hype is all about at this place. &#160;This place is ridiculously overrated. &#160;Burritos are big and aren't a bad deal for the money. &#160;They just lack quality.Saying this place has good burritos is like saying McDonalds has good burgers. &#160;They don't. the burritos are about the size of a baby seal - and i know that for me, that is definitely an important food-evaluation factor to consider when contemplating the bountiful smorgasbord of The Ave. any day in which i frequent chipotle is almost guaranteed to be a "one-meal" day - which, for a poor art student, is the best kind of day. their chicken is as dear to my heart as most newborns are to their mothers. though i would steer clear of the Guacamole scam - as far as i'm concerned, an extra glorified topping or condiment should never cost more than fifty cents. This is the best Chipotle I've been to; their food is consistently good, and their service is fast and friendly. &#160;I'm addicted to the green tomatillo salsa. &#160; Miles away from places like Taco Del Mar, which is nearby but the ingredients are never as fresh. &#160;Free student drinks are a big plus as well.
Lovely place! Great neighborhood feel, excellent food and top notch service. Most recently my friend and I shared a meal here after a long day. We were well taken care of from the moment we walked in... started with a great recommendation for a cocktail, moved on to wine with a fabulous dinner and had a great evening. My recommendation: share a bottle of Pinot Noir to go with the Entrecote w/the truffle butter (it is served with whole mess of awesome frites) - and split and order of Profit&#233;roles au Chocolat for dessert! You will NOT be disappointed.It's really more like 4.5 stars... :) I've had many a tasty evening here. I've enjoyed the cassoulet, seared scallops (when they have it as a special), and the pork chops! It's rich food in a dark, intimate-ish (neighborhoody) setting. The waiters and waitresses I've had here and at their other business a few doors down (La Cote) always have accents which sound frenchy and add to the 'frenchy' experience, lol.I would have given this place a five, but the last time I came here with friends, the service was a tad slow, and my friends got hungry and impatient :( But every place has an off night, and I'm sure Voila will redeem itself next time.Reservations have always been nice and easy to get. The place has a bunch of small tables normally filled with couples on date night ;) . But we have had a large group outing here of about 12 people, and they were able to accommodate us nicely. The clientele here are generally late 20's or older (more often older), and a little bit better dressed. OK I haven't had anything to eat or drink here. But after eating at Nishino Tuesday night a friend and I stopped in so she could get some coffee. I was planning on getting tea but unfortunately they didn't have any caffeine-free tea. I decided I was just fine with water.Anyway, the reason I am still writing this review is that the staff there was very friendly and didn't charge my friend for her coffee. We also noticed it was getting empty and felt like we should leave but they told us to take our time.With service that great I will definitely be coming back to try the food and drinks at some point. We stopped in here after dinner at (and at the recommendation of) Nishino to have a cup of coffee. The waiters were very friendly and let us sit down even though I was just getting a caffeinated beverage, and they were pretty empty at that point (10pm). They didn't even charge for my coffee! &#160;Nice. So we tipped them. &#160;And that was it. &#160;Didn't get a chance to check out the menu, but I'd come back based on the cute neighborhoody ambiance and the nice French waiters alone. Cute little place with a great feel to it. &#160;Very much a neighborhood restaurant with the small bar area and perfectly sized dining room. &#160;I made reservations for 6:30 for a friends belated birthday dinner. &#160;Upon arrival there were only a couple of tables occupied but as the evening wore on it filled up a bit more. &#160;My friend ordered the steak frites (hanger steak) and I ordered the Kobe beef burger with frites with the plan that we would split dishes. &#160;The beauty of this idea is that we each got our own serving of fries which is what we were both craving. &#160;The steak was good with a nice shallot sauce on top and the burger was delicious as well, grilled perfectly with sauteed ontions. &#160;The fries were yummy with herbs and garlic on them and a good ratio of mushy and crispiness. &#160;One of the servers suggested aioli for the fries which was a great addition.We lingered at dinner for a while without ever feeling like we were being rushed out. &#160;Overall, a good value for the quality of food and a great neighborhood spot for the locals. I discovered Voila quite by accident, and what a happy accident!Great French food, cozy atmosphere, good service, friendly staff - Voila has it all. &#160;I go there almost weekly. &#160;I love the specials and the profiteroles are amazing (_great_ chocolate sauce)!I've had almost everything on the main menu - nothing has disappointed. &#160; Love Voila! Hands down the best meal I've eaten all month. &#160;I cant imagine anything on the menu being less than fab! &#160;I recommend this cozy place with good drinks, good food, good service, and atmosphere.Loved it! Didn't really live up to my expectation based on the reviews, but food was good and we had an enjoyable evening.I had artichoke ravioli with a side of haricot verts, boyfriend had halibut cheeks (daily special) and a house salad. My ravioli was alright, but there wasn't enough cheese to balance the harsh acidity of the lemon sauce. I didn't try the halibut but he says it was decent, I'm pretty sure he was so hungry that he didn't even chew it :) The house salad was by far my favorite, the greens were SO fresh!We also ordered the mussels as an appetizer, and they were alright. Basically this place is decent but not overwhelmingly amazing. I'd go there for a lunch or a girls night dinner but probably not a date night again. I've been wanting to try this little gem for years. &#160;I've always liked the space (trying to recall what it was prior to becoming Voila!) and comment to JP each time that we drive by that we need to go there...well last night we made it happen. &#160; It was packed when we arrived around 8PM on a Wednesday but we were able to get a table for two (and as another reviewer mentioned, there is the need to slide the table out in order to get seated since the tables arethisclosetogether.) &#160;On Wednesday nights they offer 3 courses for $27, but it excludes specials and items like the cheese plate so we opted not to participate. &#160;JP ordered the spicy lamb sausage to start...he said hands down it's the best sausage he's ever had. &#160;I ordered the french onion soup and it was spectacular. &#160;For entrees JP went with the cassoulet and I ordered the scallops special. &#160;The cassoulet portion was HUGE (but delicious). &#160;It came out piping hot. &#160;JP said it got even better as it cooled down because it allowed the sauce to thicken. &#160;My scallops were seared, buttery bites of deliciousness. &#160;It was served with an excellent tomato risotto. &#160;They do not have their wines by the glass on the menu so JP was a bit taken aback when the bill arrived to discover his were $13/glass and mine was $10, but I in part chalk that up to the fact that we were recently spoiled with wine prices in Spain. &#160;All of the dishes coming out looked incredible so I am looking forward to coming back to try other items! &#160;The staff was accomodating and attentive. &#160;Great little neighborhood place! Had a nice dinner here a few weeks ago. I had the hanger steak frites and the onion soup. She had the beef bourguignon. Both meals were very good. Steak was cooked to perfection and the frites were pretty good. Her beef was very flavorful and tender. Loses a star for slow (very slow) service at the conclusion of our meal. A bill should not take 15 minutes to process. Also they need to do some improvement to the front windows as sitting close to them gives you a nice cold air breeze throughout your meal. The food is usually very good to excellent. &#160;Mica is a great waiter. &#160;But beware if you get a second-string server. &#160;We went a couple of Sunday's ago and our waitress did not know the wine list; had this deer-in-the headlights look about her; and when we mentioned that we had received an e-mail about the birthday dessert, she said, "well, I don't know anything about the e-mail," and didn't care to find out. &#160;Suffice it to say, regardless of how good the food, second-string wait staff diminished greatly the quality of our experience. &#160;But if you get Mica or other top-notch sever, you'll have a great time. Their kobe burger is pretty amazing. &#160;You should have it on their back patio while the sun is still here. Best find in very long time. &#160;This little hidden gem was perfect for a French Bistro and an early dinner on a beautiful Saturday. &#160;We went down to Madison Park to visit some friends and my girlfriend couldn't stop raving about the burger she had at Voila! so we decided to walk there for dinner.The only negative I have about this restaurant is the proximity of the tables. &#160;They are set so close together that you have to move your table if you need to get out from the bench for any reason - just FYI.That being said, we started our meal with an assorted cheese plate. &#160;The cheeses we received were a nice variety: a triple cream, manchego, goat cheese, and a double cream. &#160;The entire cheese selection was delicious and we left nothing on the plate. &#160;My boyfriend and I also ordered the salade maison (house salad). &#160;The salad was very light with a mixture of greens and a wonderful vinaigrette - a perfect salad before a main course. &#160;For our entrees, I ordered the Saumon &#224; la CR&#200;ME (salmon), my boyfriend ordered the Onglet &#224; l'Echalotte (hanger steak), and our friends each ordered one of the infamous kobe beef hamburgers. &#160;The salmon I ordered was very fresh and cooked perfectly. &#160;The lemon creme fraiche atop the salmon was a perfect complement to the fish. &#160;I haven't had an order of salmon that good in a long time, and that's saying a lot for Seattle. &#160;The hanger steak that my boyfriend ordered was AMAZING. &#160;It was prepared in a nice shallot sauce and was devoured. &#160;After he finished the first order he ordered another one!!! &#160;Believe me, even though he is a grown man eating two steaks is a lot of food, but he successfully finished both orders and was content. &#160;Two days later, he was actually asking to go back for more! &#160;The kobe beef hamburgers were also wonderful. &#160;The thick patties and fresh made buns really made for a great burger. &#160;After we were through eating, everyone was extremely impressed with the meal. Voila! was a truly enjoyable experience and made for a wonderful dinner at the end of a beautiful day. We will definitely be going here again, probably sooner than later. Went there the middle of last week, having been there a couple times before, and we won't be going back soon. There was nothing wrong with the food, exactly, though I've tasted better mussels at Brouwer's and 35th Street Bistro, and the profiteroles are worth having. But the ambience was off-putting and not relaxing, though the place wasn't crowded, nor was there loud music or bustle.The maitre d' seemed unhelpful, almost to the point of gracelessness. For instance, our table was getting a blinding ray of early evening sunlight, so we asked whether that would change in a few minutes, failing which we'd move elsewhere. No, it wouldn't change, he said; the only other table was this one (right outside the kitchen). Well, he was wrong on both counts. After fifteen minutes, every table was in shadow, and there were tables available out back. Meanwhile, we were talking in hushed tones because one or another of the waitstaff was standing right behind my chair. I felt pretty uncomfortable, and my wife did too. When the maitre d' served us, he reached across me, not once but three times. I thought that was the first thing they taught you not to do when waiting tables, and he's European, no less. The other staff seemed to be dragging themselves around. Only the fellow who served our profiteroles cared enough to smile.Not a terrible experience, by any means, but not one I'd care to repeat. I went to Voila on gorgeous sunny day and sat out on the patio. I had heard great things about the restaurant and was very excited about finally getting a chance to dine there. Let's just say i was left very underwhelmed. I went with a friend and she ordered the mussels which was a main focus of excitement only to find out they were completely out. I was shocked and since it was only 6:30pm inexcusable in my book. So I brushed it off and my appetizer was the onion soup and great traditional french dish but it was a little too salty for my taste. MY friends has the endive salad which she enjoyed but i thought it was lacking. My main course was Seared scallops with a leek risotto which was very tasty &#160;and I quite enjoyed the dish. Unfortunately the service was terrible, the food was also quite pricy and the negatives greatly outweighed the pros of the evening. Went for dinner to Voila after couple years - mainly to check out their Kobe Beef burger! it was perfect except for the bun, which could have been better, still overall an awesome burger! also had amazing escargot, laden with tons of green garlic &amp; butter &amp; a great Zuchini salad. We were 6 people so ordered several things &amp; no one was unhappy with what they ate...the server was a nitwit so not the most pleasant experience from that standpoint but the great food more than made up for it :) We came to Voila with a decent sized group on a weeknight (with reservations) and they were fabulous! The waitstaff was attentive and accommodating. My partner, who is vegetarian, was concerned about what he could eat. They ended up making him a special risotto, which was not only delicious but looked gorgeous. My ravioli with butternut squash were perfectly cooked and flavorful. The house salads were simple but quite large. They had an excellent wine selection to boot. Very solid neighborhood French bistro. &#160;No big surprises on the menu or the plate but there's nothing wrong with a well prepared, classic French bistro dish. &#160;Maybe not the kind of place you'd drive across town for, but definitely a place I could see myself going to often if I lived nearby. &#160;Also quite affordable. &#160;Service a touch slow, but good. I had stopped in for a salad and a drink with a friend, thought the place was cute. My husband mentioned he saw a french bistro and wanted to try it. We went in last night for dinner. We started with the escargot special and the french soup. The snails were ridiculously delicious and the soup very tasty. We asked for recommendations on glasses of wine and were very pleased with what we received. We fought over who would order the hanger steak in shallot sauce- I decided to the duck special and was sad I did. The hanger steak was delicious and came with really nice mashed, velvety smooth potatoes. The duck was in a cognac sauce and came with a potato gratin, which I sadly enjoyed more than the duck. But all in all, really tasty and will be back again! Great Spot. &#160;Would give it a 3.5-3.75. &#160;Bistro in Madison Park that consistently delivers. &#160;Cassolet is pretty good. Salads are always fantastic. &#160;Their Steak and Moule Frites are really tastely - especially the Moule Frites with Blue Cheese. &#160;Last night the rabbit on pasta was very tastey. &#160;They have an adequate bar area for waiting for a table and is not a bad place to eat if it is not too busy. &#160;Wine list is a collection of French and local. &#160;And their is a &#160;killer Kobe beef burger if you are simply in the mood for a burger and a big red. Had dinner there last night and it was just a great experience. &#160;The staff was excellent. &#160;I had the Belgium endive salad w/ walnuts and blue cheese in a shallot and champagne vinagrette. &#160;It was awesome. &#160;I also had the cassoulet which was good but not great. &#160;(hence 4 stars and not 5) Others at the table thoroughly enjoyed the porkchop and "rillete de porc". &#160;I will definitely go back! We tried this for the first time last Sat with another couple. &#160;Originally we were supposed to go to Luc across the street but the reservation was lost and it was unclear when we could get a table there and Voila could seat us pretty quickly. &#160;The decor, greeting and service (bar and tableside) was quick, friendly and responsive. I was impressed that they serve mussels in 3 different sauces, something I have not seen in Seattle. All the courses were very good (mussels, cassoulet, hanger steak) accept for my ribeye steak which was only good. &#160;The cut was too thin and it was overcooked. &#160;Taste wise the truffle butter was excellent as were the accompanying frites (albeit more american in style). &#160;We all liked the dessert (profiteroles) and coffee. I will return and do recommend. Voila! has been exactly what I've been in search of for months now, a French bistro that wasn't pretentious nor pricey. It's a causal neighborhood place on a woodlined street in Madison Park. When trying new places I start out simple, trying the popular items on the menu. However this time it was difficult because there were several specials including a not often seen, trout almondine. Although tempting, I went for the "Onglet", also know as the French Bistro (Hanger Steak). An inexpensive cut deep in flavor served medium rare topped with a housemade herb butter and pommes frites. Comfort food for the soul if I say so myself. Perfectly grilled and so tender that it could serve as a distraction if on a first date...A meal to serve as a perfect compliment to the classic bistro scene with the dark wood decor and endless selection of French wines. The place even has a dining patio in the "backyard" that seems appealing to the locals. I'll have to try that the next time...
This is a great bistro. Wish there were more of them in the city. Nicely decorated, service good and the food was excellent. Yum! I had the salmon with lemon butter and my husband had a meat dish - can't remember what it's called. We split a sald and the dressing was to die for. We cleaned it out after with our bread. We each had a dessert after - tarte tartine and I had the profiteroles. Wish there had been more! I would highly recommend this place. We didn't get the chatty waiter - maybe next time! This was my second visit to Voia! This visit was just as good as the first. I tried the Cote de Porc Grillee (Grilled Pork Chop in Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Lemon, Garlic &amp; Herbs). The Pork Chop was very tender and the combination of the oil, lemon, garlic and herbs was delicious! This is one of my favorite bistros in Seattle. It's just the right size. It's not too small that you feel cramped, and it's not too big that it gets too noisy on a busy night. The service is just as good as the food. Our waiter was very knowledgeable. This is the perfect bistro for a nice date or a special occasion. I had a lovely dinner with friends at this small, cozy french restaurant. &#160;It has a great atmosphere and the meals are really affordable ($12-$15). &#160;I had the Cote de Porc Grillee &#160;(pork chop!) which was awesome.
Happy Hour Review! &#160;A short visit to Madison Park and a quick eat. &#160;We opted to situate ourselves outside on the patio, taking in partial views of the park and the lake. &#160;A pulchritudinous server, her name Ashley I believe, provided wonderful service and intriguing dialogue on gourmet fare. &#160; What we consumed:A dozen Treasure Cove pacific oysters - savory with a crisp, clean finish. &#160;The absolute best tasting oysters on the half shell I have had in a long, long time!A mini dish of MPCeasar salad with dreamy house made croutons (chewy texture w/ infused anchovy olive oil, addicting!), fresh greens, and cheese - amazing, however I wished for more on my plate!Burger: &#160;not really what I had expected and was more a medium rare cooked patty then what was requested (medium) and on the bland side. &#160;I would pass on this one next time; it seemed a bit out of place amongst the other items ordered. &#160;(Quick question: why did I order a burger here anyway?) &#160;Best of the night: &#160;grilled beef tongue - unbelievably soft, delicate and perfect with minature pickles, mustard, pickled grapes and toasted bread. &#160;So goooood!I enjoyed my visit and hope to return for a lovely dinner in the near future. &#160; On a related note: &#160;congratulations to Chef Cormac Mahoney for winning Food &amp; Wine's 2012 Best New Chefs award!! We could not have picked a better place to dine for our anniversary - from the warm, thoughtful service to the outsanding watermelon salad (seriously, the combination of Serrano ham + watermelon + pistachio and feta = perfect summer salad) and our amazing meals, we are delighted that we chose MPC for our evening out. You kindly held our table when we got caught in traffic and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. &#160;You even packed up our desserts so we were able to get home on time to put the baby to sleep. We look forward to coming back soon to enjoy your exceptional service and inventive dishes. It's not a surprise that Madison Park Conservatory was featured in Food &amp; Wine. Starting from the appetizer to the drinks...to the very cozy setting...we loved (almost) everything about this restaurant. Drinks: Dark &amp; Stormy is where it's at. Ginger beer + bitters (with a very herbal/earthy taste). I didn't like it at first but it definitely grew on me. The other drink that we ordered was the Reviver. This was more of a girly drink for me...tarty, sweet, but with enough alcohol in it to make you feel a little ...something something. Appetizers: As recommended by the waiter, we had the beef tongue. This was probably the BEST beef tongue I've ever had. It was incredibly tender! They must have poached it and braised it for hours!! To help balance out the plate, it came with perfectly pickled GRAPES and delicious cornichons! It was definitely our favorite dish of the evening. Entrees: The special of the night was 20 oz of brined porkchops. The dish came out with 2 porkchops stacked on top of each other. Incredibly moist and flavorful &#160;-- this dish was practically inhaled. The second dish that we tried was the tagliatalle with spring lamb bolognese sauce...a bit on the small side but I appreciated the fact that it didn't feel too heavy. The ground lamb was very lean and I loved the pecorino shavings on top -- it was very beautifully presented. Two Food and Wine Best New Chefs of 2012 last night @ MPC. &#160;Jenn Louis (from Lincoln in PDX) made the drive from Portland to do a little collaboration with Cormac last night featuring albacore tuna. &#160; &#160;While waiting for the main course Jenn took a little time to come over to our table and chat with us for 5 minutes and that is where I got my temporary tattoo! &#160; &#160;Yes, you are thinking...wow how do I get one of those?? The answer is, damn I don't know, you just had to have been there.Our meal consisted of albacore belly poke, a pasta pocket filled with some spinach and a hint of ricotta (strozzapreti), the main course of albacore loin over israeli couscous, and finished with dessert.Each course was great....well prepared, not delivered to the table on top of each other, simple and damn tasty! &#160;The fail of the night was the dessert though. &#160;An 'ugly cookie" is what the translation meant and it was not really that ugly, just impossible to eat. &#160;The cookie was shaped like a baseball and so I thought I would attack it with my spoon. &#160;Epic disaster as a piece shot from my spoon covered in the blueberry compote. &#160;After ricocheting off my napkin (thankfully) it fell to the floor. &#160;I continued to eat the egg white cookie full of nuts a lot more carefully. &#160;It didn't really go with the meal and kinda was a disappointment at the end. &#160;The bar was closed so I didn't get the opportunity to try one of their manhattan drinks, but next time for sure! &#160;I would absolutely come back for another event, monday night dinner series, or regular day to try other dishes up MPC's sleeves. MPC5 starsI did not know they had Happy Hour or the upstairs bar with patio overlooking the lake. &#160;I was so surprised. &#160;We popped in and did not want to leave. &#160;The drinks were only so-so. &#160;I am going to say that is because the bartender, self admitted, was not a bartender and was just filling in. &#160;I would say, based on how the bar is stocked... this place would normally be amazing.The food is awesome. &#160;I started with the oysters, $1.50ea. &#160;They were huge. &#160;My wife started with the cheese plate. &#160;It was a good portion with bread and fruit. &#160;She was extremely happy. &#160;She also had the nettle soup. &#160;It was bright green and had a wonderful fresh flavor with a light mouth feel. &#160;I had the charcuterie plate and the duck fat roasted potatoes. &#160;The meat plate was great. &#160;The pate that comes with it is one of the more disgusting things to look at, but it was so tasty. &#160;The service was friendly. The prices for the Happy Hour were great. We were recommended to have dinner here by a Seattle foodie friend and were so happy we came in! &#160;We ate here in June so I don't remember all that we ordered: &#160; 2 appetizers, 2 entrees (some rice-type dish and the red meat option) and 2 desserts (cake and and ice cream dish). &#160;It doesn't matter what you order. &#160;All of them were phenomenal and honestly much better than they sounded on the menu. &#160;It's unique to see into the kitchen as you enter. &#160;The service was great and the chef came over to chat with us. &#160;He's so down to earth and passionate about food that it made our experience all the more enjoyable. A friend and I have a date night every couple of months and MPC was on our list. &#160;MPC is a place I wanted to try for some time so I had a lot of anticipation. &#160;It was worth the wait. &#160;The space is comfortable, pleasant and light. &#160;All people who worked there greeted us warmly and were friendly and attentive. &#160;The food was excellent. &#160;Some of the best I have had in Seattle. &#160;My favorite was a wonderful starter of wood baked Pecorino Fresca, shaved washington asparagus, truffle. &#160;Very tasty. &#160;I recommend the place. What a difference 6 months makes. &#160;MPC must have gone to charm school and it shows. &#160;On my first visit we were ignored upon arrival and service was chilly. &#160;Now you are warmly greeted at the door, even the chefs in the kitchen shout "Hello!" through their peek-a-boo window as you enter. We were given menus and told to sit anywhere we wanted, upstairs or down. &#160;What a welcoming feeling. Our server was excellent. &#160;He knew every little thing about the food, its origins, the producers and cautioned about ordering too much as the portions were "shareable" and might be too much. &#160;He actually sat down as we discussed this. It reminded me of the" Portlandia" episode about ordering &#160;chicken and discussing its social life and lineage if you know what I mean.The food was excellent. &#160;We had the Cesar with anchovy-ized croutons, covered in a dusting of reggiano. I had the salmon which was done perfectly and a nice size portion. The GF had squid in black rice which was also well done, reminded us of Spain. Finally, because Yelpers seemed to agree- the Olive Oil Gelato- wow that was good. &#160;Yes, do get it. &#160;Salty, olivey creamy goodness. MPC has got it's groove on and they really have hit their stride. This hidden gem has always been my go to spot when friends and family come into town! &#160;Brian and the rest of the staff always make it a fun and enjoyable night. &#160;Thanks again!!
When I came to visit Seattle for the first time I came to Portage Bay. &#160;It was quite a wait, but at the time I felt it was worth it. &#160;Since then, I've been back every time someone comes to visit (only for breakfast/brunch). &#160;After the last time I went, I feel like it's a little overrated.I've tried the Organic Pancakes, Wild Berry Compote French Toast, Organic Apple and Whole Wheat Pancakes along with some other weekend specials. &#160;And quite frankly, if it weren't for the toppings bar, everything would be really dry and kind of bland. &#160;The breakfast bar is the only thing that is worth the money and the wait here, and that's only because I hate cutting and peeling my own fruit. &#160;The potatoes are also pretty decent. &#160;But you can't really go wrong with potatoes for breakfast.I get that Portage Bay is organic, but there are a lot of other restaurants in Seattle that sell that same message and actually put out an above average meal. After reading great reviews and only hearing good things, I was psyched to try Portage Bay - In my opinion, I thought it was highly over-rated but then again it's probably my own fault for going savory vs sweet. &#160; Apparently, they're famous for their waffles/pancakes/french toast and even have a toppings bar with fruits, nuts, and organic (of course) maple syrup. &#160;Everything is locally grown and organic (that seems to be a trend in Seattle). &#160;Beware though, the organic ketchup tasted funny/gross. &#160;However, I do love their motto - "Eat like you give a damn", which I definitely do :) I had the Italian egg white omelette (substituted the andouille for chicken apple sausage) and it was only mediocre. &#160;The potatoes were fine, but I'm a big fan of ketchup on my potatoes, and the organic crap they had wasn't cutting it for me. Their coffee was crap as well and the service was good at the beginning, but became almost non-existent towards the end. &#160;Not worth the 20 minute wait. A great place for breakfast. I've heard there are a few around the Seattle area, but the UW one is the only one I've visited. The place is always PACKED! That tells something on its own right?My spouse often talks about this place because of their organic menu. Everything is well prepared and presented. Breakfast never looked so gooooooood. The wait can be from 10 minutes to 30 depending on the size of your group. It's well worth it though. =) I take one star off for not offering any lunch fare on the weekends. &#160;I think it's silly that they only serve breakfast/brunch.The food is good, as long as you're looking for brunch food. &#160;They use all organic-like stuff, so things like the ketchup can taste odd if you're not used to that. &#160;They have their berry bar that has a crap load of additional toppings for your pancakes or french toast. &#160;Prices are reasonable for the massive portions.The place can be loud and the service spotty. &#160;Expect a 20 minute wait on the weekends. First off the wait to get in the door was almost an hour, but that doesn't bother me, I knew that would be the case when I went. I waited expecting a great brunch from what I've read/heard, but that was not the case. I had the crab cake benedict which I did not find appealing at all. I honestly had a better crab cake at a greasy spoon for lunch the day before. The potatoes were good however. My fiance had the blueberry and peach blintzes which were somehow missing the peaches. One cool aspect was the toppings bar which allows you to load-up (eat what you take the menu warns...and don't share!) on berries, whip cream, etc. Unfortunately the fruit wasn't great. So instead of waiting for an amazing brunch we waited for a sub-par attempt at brunch standards. I've been to the Portage Bay Cafe twice so far. &#160;Here is my 0.02 about this place.Pros: - if you call ahead and put your name on the list, you can reduce the waiting time-there is a tofu scramble dish on the menu ( I am not a big fan of eggs)Cons:-the wait time is long-the tofu scramble is blend-the fruit bar is underwhelming. &#160;it looks like various canned food- not very appetizing-poor service - as an example, last time I went in a group of four and before we ordered, we asked to separate the tab into two. &#160;When the bill came, it was not separated and so I asked again if we can separate it. &#160;Our waitress gave me a VERY dirty look and her displeasure was so evidently to my entire party. &#160; So understandably, I was really irritated. &#160;And then she said, ok I will split it down the middle for you. &#160;But, I had ordered a few mimosas and didn't think it was fair that my dining companions had to financially compensate for my lush ass. &#160;So I told her to split it by order. &#160;Is that too much to ask? &#160;Maybe it is me? &#160;Well, either way, she made the paying process a real pain in the ass. &#160;If it were up to me, I'd tip 0.01 for the nasty attitude. &#160;But my better half insisted that I tip 18% (he used to work in the industry). &#160;In conclusion, the waitress that we had last time left such a negative impression and the food is really. &#160;So I definitely would not be back anytime soon.Thanks YELP for letting me vent. &#160;It feels SOOOOO good! I'm sorry, but could someone please explain the hype about this place? Honestly, I've always been skeptical of any restaurants with the long lines out the door. Were they handing out $20 bills or something? I've eaten here a few times and I've always left rather disappointed. &#160;Last year I bought a gift certificate through an auction and decided to invite a few friends for brunch. We made the mistake of coming here on a Sunday, undoubtedly the busiest day of the week. The place was a freaking zoo, with the long line of lemmings waiting to get in. Once a seat finally opened up, they placed us next to the "waffle bar" area in their non-descript overflow room. Bowls of frozen berries sitting in their own diluted juice. Yuck. Some of us made the mistake of ordering pancakes or waffles, and were stuck with the soggy toppings. The other dishes including the migas were mediocre at best. Perhaps I should the PBC during the week to give it a fair shot, but there are far better places for breakfast in this town. I'll leave this place for the college kids.
Our first experience was more like a 5 star...our last experience was a 1 star experience, I don't think we'll go back sadly...The menu is interesting and we love the fact it has locally sourced, organic ingredients..Our first visit, we enjoyed the omelettes and hashes. &#160;On our last visit we did unfortunately have some misses the crab cake benedict wasn't that great, some of the potatoes were undercooked, and the porridge was awful (not at all like what I've had in India or abroad)...The major rant for the service was the miserable service experience we had on a Monday for our little one's two year old birthday. &#160; Breakfast is her favorite meal and we took her here before and she loved it but this time was a bummer. &#160; I've never seen so many scowling faces in one place and so many eye rolls. &#160;Eye rolls from the hostess when she misunderstood that our party doesn't want to sit outside but would rather sit inside. &#160;Eye rolls from the waitress when I sent my order of crab benedict back because I asked for the hollandaise on the side instead of on it (not smothered all over the thing with an extra helping on the side). &#160;After our first experience, we really thought we had found a great Seattle breakfast hot spot... Back to searching I guess.. &#160;A good breakfast place is about having good service and this one doesn't deliver. It has been a while since we last visited and while it did what it needed to-fed us breakfast- it was not as wonderful an experience as I would have hoped. We called before &amp; were told once we checked in we would be "first on rotation". There is no waiting indoors so we were out on the street. We weren't sure if that would be good enough considering the long wait out the door, but it was! We were in &amp; seated within 10 min. You can supposedly get a water of coffee while you wait from the barrista, but we were stoically ignored. Once seated, the enormous cacophony of noise enveloped us. It is just noisy here. We had to shout to talk to each other. This is in the original room, I bet the garden seating or the new room is better. Hopefully the server was just having a bad day because her sour face it became a joke to us. She did the bear min (take order &amp; deliver food) without smiling once. Mumbled "Your waters will be out in a min" was only heard by the person she was closest to. Anything she could put off to her busser- she did. As a former server I hate to leave a bad tip, but felt justified in 10% for her. The menu is extensively marked with "organic"! Too extensively. Even ingredients are marked as organic or not . So much so it had our friend noting that the bathroom isn't so eco-friendly with paper towels &amp; 2 gallon toilets. It's not like us to be catty about eco-ness, but the setting brought it out in us. And the menu was pricey with average menu items at $12. Not outrageous, especially considering that most are delicious. All-you-can-eat fruit bar is no joke &amp; comes together with fresh whipped cream, brown sugar, &amp; nuts. Sadly, the more expensive ($15)dungeness crab cakes were flawed. Poached eggs had 3/4 no runny innards. A small disappointment, but still a disappointment. Maybe we will try one of the other locations, but I doubt we will check out this spot again for quite some time. I just love this place for the Breakfast Bar so I would just get whatever dish gets you access to the fresh fruit and homemade whipped cream. The portions are pretty big so if you don't eat much in the mornings I would recommend sharing with someone. We had a big group, which I wouldn't really recommend for this place unless you come really early! I've always seen those looooooong lines, and I finally made it inside today.I ordered the Southwest eggs benedict. &#160;Meh. &#160;It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't phenomenal either.It looked like the pancakes was the item to get -- especially with the "help yourself" pancake topping bar.Service was ok. &#160;The place was so busy; you can't really expect superior service.Portage Bay -- check. &#160;Been there, done that. &#160;Next. This is what every breakfast place should be. Everything I need. The portion size is humongous, the menu is diverse, and the coffee is always piping hot. It can be spendy, but you get what you pay for. The quality of food is superb, and waitresses are very friendly. I love the benedict section of the menu, but occasionally get one of the enormous omelettes. Although I'm not a pancake/french toast guy, I do enjoy once in a while getting some buckwheat pancakes and raping the toppings bar. One of our favorite Breakfast joints! We tend to eat late which is better at either of the Portage Bay locations because you either need to get in at 8:30 or after noon to get around the crowds. I love their fruit selection and tend to order something plain and load up at the breakfast bar! I am particularly fond of their porridge which I load up with fruit.The special french toast or pastry specials tend to be pretty sweet so if I am in the mood for French Toast I just get the plain one which is great and load it with fruit. (You see a Fruit biased trend on my part right?!) Their coffee is excellent so I tend to go for plain coffee rather than a latte here. The food here is just alright to me. I don't get what all the hype is about! I appreciate that it is all organic but I feel like it's overpriced. There are plenty of other places around Seattle, where you can get a really good, hearty breakfast for the $30 spent here!The toppings bar is a good idea, but not all of it tastes very fresh and choices are limited. Staff is friendly and I don't think I've ever had to wait for a table though many people complain about it cause it does get busy. They have good challah French Toast here, but that's about it. I'm not a fan of their eggs benedict, which is my favorite breakfast dish.Sorry!! I love Portage Bay Cafe! &#160;The food is always wonderful. &#160;I often order french toast and take full advantage of the amazing toppings bar. &#160;As others have mentioned, the fruit bar features tons of fresh berries, yummy whipped cream, and nuts. &#160;I've had the Wild Berry Compote, Bananas Foster, and the Buckwheat french toast - all perfectly sweet and fluffy. &#160;The red skinned potatoes are always hot and seasoned well. &#160;The menu has plenty to choose from, for both carnivores and herbivores, which I greatly appreciate. &#160;The only time I went for lunch instead of brunch, I ordered the organic grain salad. &#160;It had lots of veggies and greens, protein from the garbanzo beans, and was very filling. &#160;My companion ordered the prime rib dip, reported that it was scrumptious, and had enough leftover for lunch the next day.Street parking is pretty easy. &#160;I took a star off because of the EXTREMELY long wait for weekend brunch (although, the wait is very quick if you go for lunch on an weekday) and it's pretty expensive. Seattle's best breakfast spot!! I've been here several times...through my hungover college days till now and they have never disappointed. There's always a wait, but after being seated the service is impeccable and the food comes out in a hurry. They use all organic and locally grown ingredients which is a plus.If you order any of their pancakes/french toast you get a all you can toppings bar that includes nuts, fruits, butter, syrups &amp; a to die for hand-whipped cream.Other don't miss yummies...MigasEggs scrambled with smoked chipotle peppers, organic mediumand sharp cheddar, cumin, fresh basil, homemade salsa andsour cream wrapped in a flour tortilla. ADD CHORIZO!!Ranchers BreakfastEggs any style, your choice of pepper bacon,black forest ham or Isernio's chicken-basil sausage and twoorganic pancakes or two slices of French toast (which also includes a trip to the toppings bar).The bonus that puts Portage Bay over the top is their free parking lot lot. Be careful and don't miss the entrance, otherwise you'll be doing a big loop around. If I could, it would be 3.5 stars. My friends and I planned to have brunch here one day, but left after no one paid attention to us and hearing from other customers in line that the wait was 45+ minutes! A couple of months later, we decided to try again and came extremely early. Luckily we got there before the rush.I ordered the Seasonal Compote French Toast, but I'm not sure if it was worth the trouble. There were 3 substantial pieces of Challah french toast covered with if I remember correctly, Blueberry Compote. The toppings bar was nice, but I was expecting more fresh fruit... I think there were a lot of thawed berries. Despite all that, I thought the french toast was delicious and filling. I really appreciate the fact that Portage Bay Cafe uses organic/sustainable foods... that alone = +stars! I definitely want to return, but it will probably be at the other location. Let's see how long I will have to wait there... Portage Bay Cafe is always super super busy when I go, and I always end up getting seated right next to the open door or outside, and then being cold the whole time. &#160;Also, having to wait to be *seated* for *breakfast* really sucks.Their Swedish pancakes were just okay. &#160;I've never been to Sweden, but I know Swedish pancakes are supposed to be more like crepes, which I love... &#160;But these were more like slightly-thin American pancakes, which I only like. &#160;The lingonberries were pretty good, but there was too much butter and not enough lingonberries. &#160;Also, they were kinda expensive.Their curried tofu veggie scramble was pretty blah. &#160;It turns out I still hate olives, and the dish had a lot of them; without them, it wasn't very flavorful. &#160;It was also super greasy. &#160;The greens were basically just romaine, I think, which is not what I was expecting; it was weird. &#160;The orange juice was okay, but when I ordered tea, they gave me the smallest tea pot I have ever seen. &#160;It made about 3/4 a mug of tea (thx to the lid not being secured and me pouring a good bit of it into my lap through the mesh of the outdoor table). &#160;And, unlike some nice brunch places (namely Cafe Flora), there was no timer with the tea to let me know when it had steeped for long enough, which was a little sad. &#160;I was also expecting loose leaf tea, but it was a tea bag. &#160;Why am I paying $2.50 for a tea bag and a tiny bit of hot water? &#160;I'm sure the french toast is good, and the toppings bar looks mostly okay, but other than that, meh. &#160;Portage Bay Cafe hasn't really impressed me yet. My gal pal and I stopped at Portage Bay for brunch to reward ourselves for 10 long weeks of school! We both ordered scrambles -- she ordered the scramble with sauteed mushrooms and I ordered it with bacon, of course. My favorite part about the scrambles is the sweet potatoes! It adds a nice sweet taste that contrasts with the savory flavors. The portion is huge and it comes with wheat toast. Neither of us finished and took the leftovers home to our sweeties. I highly recommend Portage Bay. It's very comfortable, relaxing, simple and classy. It emphasizes the use of seasonal and organic ingredients without being pretentious. Make sure to get there early on weekends. It fills up quickly! I have to admit, this place is kind of overrated, in my opinion.The toppings bar sounds really appealing to folks but there aren't really many options to select from. If I recall, there were strawberries, blackberries, blueberries and some nuts. I was craving bananas and I asked my bf to grab some since he had the only dish that included the toppings bar... and there were no bananas. I was disappointed.I ordered Phil's Breakfast with sausage. The sausage was probably the best part of the whole ordeal. I was really not a fan of the potatoes. My bf had the french toast which he enjoyed so that was good. My other friend had the crabcakes and he thought that was okay as well.Overall, I know the appeal of this place is that everything is locally sourced and the ingredients are organic and what not, but I think that's pretty much it. The service didn't really stand out for me and the food was so-so. Not really worth the 30-minute wait. Just got back from the Ballard location and I'd have to review this location similarly. I dropped a star because they should be able to learn from their mistakes at the U-district location, and 2 stars, according to Yelp, means "Meh. I've experienced better."The food is really good, but the biggest issue is the surly servers. Why are they so upset that people are eating there? Perhaps their attitude is drawn from the manager who, during our breakfast, sported a badger's scowl.Another issue with both locations is the lack of space between tables. Bring your shoe-horn to ease yourself into your seat. I think when restaurant owners balance the wait time with the available space, the latter gets sacrificed for the former. Which makes sense from a fiscal standpoint, but not from a customer satisfaction standpoint. I don't give many places a 5 star rating... but Portage Bay was awesome! &#160;I liked the fact that their slogan is "eat like you give a damn."Makes you think about where you food comes from, what goes into your body, how animals are handled before they come to you, how the food tastes, and how it affects the environment. &#160;What a great philosophy!We were seated immediately, even though it was during a busy time. &#160;The service was quick, we received our bill in a timely matter AND our food was amazing.I ordered a cafe scramble with ham, mushrooms and cheese (with egg). It was the first time in a long time that i could actually taste how delicious the mushrooms were in the scramble. &#160;I can't do that anywhere else!Food around me was devoured quickly and quietly. Vegan friendly, Vegetarian friendly, gluten free friendly and Very Organic.... Its a great place to go to. &#160;Find one in a location near you!! This is my favorite breakfast place in Seattle. I'm always so conflicted when going here, though. Should I get the oatmeal? the granola parfait? or the rancher's breakfast with the challah french toast? I am the type of person who wants some meat/eggs for breakfast because if I fill up on pancakes I'll just be hungry again in a few hours. So my normal strategy is to make my husband go with me, then he orders a hash or something and I order french toast, and then we share.I know they have good lunch stuff too, but I just can't pass up breakfast food when I go here, no matter what time it is. Yay yay for Portage Bay Cafe. Don't let the line keep you away. Come early in the day, and you'll be okay! Ooooh. Tough.Still love the concept and most food is good, but... the limited breakfast menu after 11am on weekdays made me lose some of my appreciation for this place.If you're going to continue some breakfast items during lunch, please do it right!We spent $9 each for some eggs, some potatoes that were lukewarm by the time we got 'em (and tasted like they'd been sitting around for a while), one okay sliced sausage, and some barely-warm toast. Thankfully the service was pretty good and my guy's coffee got about three refills.I wasn't particularly interested in their lunch options so I think I'll limit my future visits to regular breakfasts here (before 11am on weekdays, weekend brunch) and skip the "limited breakfast menu" that they have during lunch-time.I'm thinking more of a 3.5 in general and it's the best breakfast place I know of in the U-District... but I think I need to be a tad bit more impressed to move it up to the "I'm a fan" level. I've tried egg benedict at every single restaurant in a 10 mile radius of my house. &#160;Seriously. Portage Bay has some damn fine eggs benedict and big ol' mugs of coffee (I had three this morning!) to wash them down with. &#160;The potatoes were also fantastic. &#160;My friend had Swedish pancakes with Lingonberry butter that she said were also fantastic. &#160;It's a little &#160;more than I like to spend on breakfast (18 for breakfast/coffee/tip for one person) but it was a good treat.My only complaint is that there was no hostess. &#160;I sat in the chairs in &#160;front waiting for someone to notice me for about 10 minutes before I just went and sat down. &#160; I watched several other people come in and have the same confusion. (About 4 waiters walked past me and didn't even look at me) &#160;wanted someone to offer me a cup of coffee, at least, while I waited for my friend. Maybe there is a hostess on the weekends? &#160; They should at least get a "please seat yourself" sign. The sweet treats are what it is about here. The hash was okay, but under seasoned and I hate when places top a hash with scrambled eggs instead of over-easy and it did not specify this. The toast was a hard crunchy little bit of toast... The berry compote, graham cracker crusted french toast was awesome. You can take a trip to the toppings bar, where they have fresh berries, pears, peaches, whipped cream, butter and syrup that you can load up on as much as you'd like. I also took advantage of the slivered almonds ;)The portions are HUGE and you could easily share, but they charge like $6 per plate shared or something absurd like that. They aren't cheap, but decent breakfast for the price. I really, really wanted to like this place. &#160;Mostly because I'd had a string of fairly disappointing dining experiences that were severely lacking in both vegan protein sources AND flavor. &#160;I checked out their menu and - yes! &#160;Tofu! &#160;I don't think I'd ever been so excited to eat me some friggin' tofu.Unfortunately, I was foiled AGAIN, and this time by an error of management. &#160;I go there for brunch with my family and while we enjoy delicious "choose your own juice" mimosas (brilliant! &#160;Grapefruit is extra yummy!), I peruse the menu and see three whole vegan options on this otherwise omnivore menu! &#160;My parents were happy with their options - lots and lots of different kinds of scrambles and omelettes - and I was perfectly happy with my options - one curried tofu scramble, one vegan hash with tofu and potatoes, and a vegan pancake! &#160;I was tempted by the vegan pancake because it would allow me to partake of their cool toppings bar (you can top your own pancakes, french toast, and oatmeal with fruit and things) and because it's so rare to see vegan pancakes on the menu of a non-vegan restaurant. &#160;But I was dying of severe protein deprivation after a long weekend of eating out at high-end and relatively vegan unfriendly places. &#160;So - tofu hash it is!Unfortunately, when I get my hash it looks surprisingly...um...lacking. &#160;In tofu. &#160;They forgot the tofu in my tofu hash.It takes me about 5 minutes to flag someone down who goes "d'oh!" and takes my plate back to the kitchen. &#160;Okay, fine. &#160;A weird mistake, but I'll live. &#160;When my plate comes back I'm told that they are OUT OF TOFU. &#160;The whole restaurant. &#160;Out of tofu. &#160;So here is a plate of potatoes! &#160;YUM.To make matters worse, she didn't give us any break on the bill (she "forgot") and we had to track her down and "remind" her. &#160;She ended up comping my entree but, really, that should be expected for that kind of error.Other than my tofu debacle, the menu does look nice and the food was decently executed (my potatoes at least) and barring any silly oversight, vegans SHOULD have three options, so pretty good for vegan friendliness - IN THEORY. &#160;But flighty (at best) to unfriendly (at worst) service, plus a pleasant but uninspired ambiance to my parents being only mildly impressed with their omelettes and pancakes respectively still doesn't elevate this place in my esteem, even tofu aside.Needless to say, when I got home I ate an entire block of tofu. &#160;Smothered in BBQ sauce. &#160;Yes, yes, I know - I'll open a restaurant soon! Yeah yeah, the wait can be really long, and it's a bit on the spendy side, but they have a toppings bar, people! A TOPPINGS BAR! Keep your eye on the prize!I had the french toast--three slices of bread about 3 inches thick. Then add the berries, fruit, whipped cream, and nuts from the toppings bar, and I'd say it's about 500 cubic inches of pure deliciousness. I was still eating long after The Boy had finished his bacon and eggs, and he commented "I've never seen you eat so much!". (But in a nice way) I think he was just jealous. The service was just OK. We kind of got ignored for a while, which resulted in my never getting a coffee refill, but also allowed me to eat 2/3 of the meal without feeling like I needed to ask for a box. I've heard lots of great things about the food here, but I didn't think my dish was all that great... I ordered the omelete with salmon and guacamole on top. Firstly, my omelete was dry. The salmon inside was also DRY. The guacamole usually can help compensate the dryness, but there was a tiny spoonful ontop that was devoured in two bites. There was barely any cheese ontop.The service was also kinda crappy. It was really busy and the place was a little understaffed, but still our waitress wasn't that great. She never stopped by to ask us about our food and never came back to refill our water, which I desperately needed from eating my dry food. We finished and waited for 20 minutes for boxes and our check. In the end, we flagged down another waitress who ended up helping us.The food was also overpriced. The concept of the restaurant is great, all natural and organic food that helps out the local farmer. I love it! But the price was too much considering it was a restaurant in the U District where everything is usually less than $10. Eh oh well. Free ParkingIt's one of life's simple luxuries, especially if you're living in rainy-seattle. &#160;Thus, my eyes lit up from seeing the sign that said "free parking" in Portage Bay's Roosevelt Menu. &#160;This small gift is not the only great thing about Portage Bay. They have a wondeful selection of vegan friendly, organic, locally bought ingredients that will satiate your appetite. &#160;Though i have heard great things about the all you can top toppings bar, i opted for the egg-hash with corned beef. &#160;The dish was delicious, but i thought it was a bit over cooked. &#160;The only thing that I could really taste were the potatoes and the eggs. &#160;The red bell peppers and other veggies ended up losing it's flavor during its burning process. &#160;With it being $13 bux a plate, i guess i was expecting more. &#160;Will I come here again? &#160;maybe. &#160;but only if i'm sharing a plate and/or someone else is paying and i need the "free parking". Portage bay, you're good but really, you're not worth my money. Very tasty, but a bit spendy, with breathless service which I found to be friendly, but a little erratic. It's important to expect a wait--in some cases 30 minutes or more--but I don't deduct star ratings for that; I don't think a restaurant deserves to be penalized for popularity! However, a restaurant this busy should be staffed and prepared for this reality.Our food arrived lickety split after we ordered, which was great. The kids' drinks took considerably longer, but I believe this was because it was a challenge to locate the specific sodas they ordered; I wasn't entirely sure. My friend had a Crab Benedict and loved it. I had a Risotto Cakes Benedict and would definitely order it again, as the Hollandaise Sauce is one of the rare restaurant versions that was both very good, and clearly made in-house, and not from a mix or powder or a can. I like mine a little tangier, but that's subjective; this was a really good quality and nicely flavored Hollandaise despite that.The eggs my son ordered, sunny side up, were almost there...but there were those transparent, gelatinous slimy bits to them that we always hope to avoid in our quest for a cooked egg with a still-runny yolk. It's a challenge, but then...it's a breakfast place, above everything. Like many other reviewers, I find the sharing fee of $6 unreasonable. The portions are rather large and I don't think people should be penalized for not eating until their snaps blast off under high pressure, blinding other diners. It seems there are other solutions to this; even a lower sharing fee would be nice, or perhaps a small a la carte menu, where they might recoup some of that (perceived) lost profit of plate-sharing.I can't help but compare that policy with other breakfast spots. I often dine alone with my sons, and plate sharing just makes sense for us sometimes because they don't eat full portions (well, one eats until he's engorged like a tick, but...the other one doesn't!). I think that factor alone is discouraging to me; it just feels petty somehow.I ordered a yerba mate and although it was very good it tasted NOTHING like mate. It was from a tea bag called "Rain Forest Mate" if I recall properly, and it tastes berry-ish, almost like acai, fruity and perfumey...nothing like the mate I drink regularly nor like what I had routinely in Argentina. But there was no reason for complaint; it wasn't an error or an oversight, just a peculiarity that was tasty in its own right. Only worth mentioning in the improbable case that you like your burgeoning plates of eggs and spuds accompanied by a nice cup of mate!Overall I think it has a lot of good things going for it; I'd suggest venturing there during off hours when you have a blaring craving for a reliable Hollandaise. I'm more on the savory than sweet side of the breakfast vice scale, but I've heard from friends that the french toast and pancakes are great, too. With such a reputation I don't know how, but it exceeded my expectations. &#160; &#160;A big part of Portage's mantra is finding quality ingredients and it's represented in the way their dishes taste. &#160;I had the banana and chocolate french toast. &#160;The french toast bread was thick &amp; moist and the most delicious I've ever had; I believe its fresh from a local bread company. &#160;I was a little skeptical about ordering bananas and chocolate on french toast, it's something that would need really good ingredients to not taste cheaply sweet, but considering their reputation for quality ingredients, I gave them the benefit of the doubt, and was rewarded. &#160;Ate here with my mother who had an omelette that came with roasted potatoes. &#160;They're seasoned such that they work well with breakfast, and were a nice touch. &#160;Only downside to this place is the wait you have to deal with since it's so busy. &#160;Our table was a little wobbly as well so that was a minor annoyance, but in situations like this where the food is so good, I look past it. &#160;Best breakfast I've had. This place is busy, even on a weekday! &#160;This review was from way back this past February, so I am going off of what I can recall.While I was a bit jealous that my friend had access to the toppings bar with her blintzes (I quickly scanned the online menu and couldn't find it. &#160;Maybe it was a special?), looking back on it, I wonder how much of the fruit was from cans or jars and not fresh? &#160;I hardly minded because I was blinded at the time by my delicious Wild Salmon Omelette.Here is the description from their menu:Wild Salmon Omelette House smoked wild Northwest salmon, Spanish manchego cheese, organic green onions and tomato, topped with organic avocado salsaFour stars because their WIld Samlon Omelette is that good.I always associate salmon with Seattle so after a year spent abroad, this was a nice way to welcome me back to the warm arms of the Pacific Northwest.I should have substituted the organic fruit for the organic local herb-roasted potatoes but I cannot help loving potatoes. I was a bit overwhelmed by the potatoes and should have focused solely on the omelette. &#160;Like many breakfast joints, the portions here are pretty big.Our server was rude and a bit snobby but I was so caught up on the omelette that I will return again, in hopes that she was just having a crummy day. I will give them the benefit of the doubt and try again and hope for the best! &#160;Sometimes we just have those days. Visit 1: Great experience, the misses and I got our brunch on. Despite the wait, the food and service were good and came fast once seated. Visit 2: Completely different from the first visit - Portage Bay is too focused on making money, why? Because their breakfast orders are fairly large in portion, the misses and I thought we'd just share the order, but guess what? The waitress said there's an additional $5.50 charge if an order is shared. Here I am thinking... you have got to be kidding me... WHAT?Visit 3: Came here because it was the only place opened in the AM. The waitress forgot the potato hash in one of our orders, so we asked for the extra hash. The waitress blanked out for a minute, and went on to respond "oh yeahhh... that does come with potato hash doesn't it?..." And the worst part is it took a long time for the side order to arrive after we told the waitress.Overall, I'd only come back to Portage Bay if they lowered their hunger for revenue and increase the consistency in high service. I really like Portage Bay Cafe, and I'm not so sure if it isn't because of their marketing campaign -- "Eat Like You Give a Damn!" &#160;They use organic ingredients and strive to source them locally. &#160;So maybe it's psychosomatic, but I feel healthier and more virtuous after eating here.My wife and I always get one sweet breakfast dish and one savory one. &#160;We get the savory one because there's plenty of good stuff to get (e.g., the dungeness crab eggs benedict is good); we get the sweet one (my favorite is the french bread w/ cinnamon, crushed pecans and raisins) because it entitles you to a trip to their fruit/toppings bar, where you can load up on some fruity/nutty goodness. &#160;While the winter months will have more preserved/canned fruits (these ingredients are sourced locally, remember?, so we're not talking about flavorless raspberries shipped from South America), the summer months are times of plenty -- with fresh berries, alongside their preserved counterparts. &#160;My favorite selection from the fruit toppings bar is the fresh whipped cream with preserved strawberries, which I presume is available year-round. &#160;(The coffee is mediocre, though.)Strictly speaking, I'd say that the food was about 4-stars, especially given that it's a tad pricey. &#160;But the show of bounty in that toppings bar and that boost of good feeling I get from their organic/local angle earns that extra star. As much as I love breakfast places usually, this hyped up place turned out just to be OK to me... I've been here twice so I don't think I'm just ordering the wrong thing. Yes, it's all organic and the best stuff for me. Yes, they have plenty of seating even though for some reason, every sunday I go by and still see masses of people waiting outside. Why? I'm not entirely sure. My guess is that they're all pro-organic-hippies-turned-into-parents and want nothing less for their family.Taste-wise, I'm a little partial to the less healthy. But really, it's OK to use a little more oil guys and not overcook stuff. The sausage I had? Tough and dry. The pancakes? I think I prefer my buttermilk ones over these organic-grainy kind. The fruit-bar is a nice touch, but it'd be nice if they kept the fresh fruit stocked so I wouldn't have to settle for jam all the time. In terms of pricing, you definitely pay your premium to get this organic stuff. Their prices are certainly higher than most other places I've been, but I'm not sure I would pay it when I know of many other local breakfast places. Portage Bay Caf&#233; has a slogan, "Eat like you give a damn." I have a slogan for Portage Bay Caf&#233;, "Serve like you give a damn." I've been to the Ballard location once (today) and the University District location once (last fall), and my slogan for this restaurant is appropriate for both locations. At least today we didn't have to wait an hour and a half to be served by a surly waitress. Attitude aside, while not worth an hour and a half wait, the food is delicious, which is why my rating made it to 3 stars. My husband and I like to share our breakfast. We order one savory dish and one sweet dish and split them. Today at the Ballard location we had the migas (without chorizo) and the bananas foster French toast. I can't remember what we had in the U District last fall, but I remember that it wasn't the food that kept us from wanting to visit the restaurant again.Portage Bay Caf&#233; is a great idea. I love restaurants that try to use local and organic ingredients when possible. The thing is that you can go to other restaurants that are doing similar things and actually have a pleasant dining experience along with great food, like Wild Mountain &#160;Caf&#233;. Room service wasn't available at Hotel Deca, so a quick search on Yelp for great breakfast nearby yielded me Portage Bay Cafe. Skimmed their website, organic? natural? Cool, hopefully it tastes good.Called in an order to-go. chorizo sausage scramble and pork sausage omelette. AMAZING. I started off with the omelette, I normally throw ketchup on my eggs, NOT THIS sucker! The potatoes are so delicious. Seriously, no condiments needed, they cooked these foods ready-to-eatMy girl started with the chorizo, they give you the tortilla (next time I'll order the migas as it comes wrapped already). It was a bit messy, and the contrast was more than I wanted from my scramble, but I had both and both are very tasty.I WILL RETURN! SOON! I love this place for weekend breakfast. There's always a wait - usually between 10 to 40 minutes - but every time it's been worth it. Someone on foursquare suggested calling ahead and making a reservation; seems like a good idea but I've never tried it.The various Benedicts are good (with home-style potatoes) and the self-serve fruit topping bar is a fun complement to the organic buckwheat pancakes. Some of the seasonal menu/specials look really tasty too.Seems to be a very popular breakfast spot when the Huskies are playing an early-ish game so be warned. The wait is long, but what can you say, it's a good restaurant, that's why there are so many people, hence the long wait. &#160;But look it's the best breakfast food in town!I always try to look for something heavy and filling, like an omelet. &#160;Delicious fresh vegetables, potatoes, spinach and tomatoes in my omelet. &#160;I can't wait for my next trip. &#160;I've never had bad service here--great restaurant if you don't mind the wait for a delicious breakfast. I know there are a million reviews of Portage but since I went again last week I'll review again and give some specifics. I took my sister and mom and they were wowed by the pure flavors and organic ingredients making traditionally comforting yet inspired dishes. Everything is fantastic, but here are my favs: Sweet - Lemon curd french toast. Nope, I'm not kidding. Makes me cry. Savory - Prosciutto and sun dried tomato omelet - ask for the potatoes extra hot Everyday - porridge with toppings bar I'll say it again and again - Volterra or anywhere else has nothing on this brunch. Added bonus - 100% consistent at SLU location. if you are ever in the situation where you wake up with a fierce hangover, next to a beautiful person you had never met before, i suggest that you bring them here. it says two things about you. first, that you are kind of a hippie and totally cool with whatever happened the night before. also, that you have pretty good taste but don't have to be pretentious about it. there is always a wait to be seated. it doesn't matter if you have a reservation or not. although they are a pleasant bunch, the wait staff are a bit slow clearing tables and seating people. maybe they're high? but once you are seated, they won't keep you waiting for food. so it's all good. share with your lover (or the stranger you met in your bed) an omelet and a serving of french toast. most all omelette's come with delicious fishes or sausages. and the bananas foster french toast is as heavenly as it sounds. the resteraunt can be kind of tricky to get to if you arn't familiar with the south side of roosevelt. &#160;just keep left after watertown and keep your eyes peeled for the parking lot. Went here for breakfast. &#160;They have a fruit topping bar that looked amazing but we didn't order it because there were so many other great things on the menu. The fruit bar comes with any pancakes or waffles you order or you can get it separately as well.Great menu, lots of unique dishes (risotto benedict, curry omelet, root vegetable hash, etc).This place boosts sustainable eating, which I love and the service was great. &#160;The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because there were little things about the actual dishes that could have been better. &#160;I ordered the risotto benedict which came with a Gruyere cream sauce. &#160;The flavors were great but the cream sauce was very thin and watery. &#160;One of the reasons that I love benedict is the thick sauce, so I was a little disappointed in that. &#160;My friend got the curry omelet and had the same complaint about the sauce that came with his. &#160;Over all it was a great meal, good service, excellent menu, lots of vegetarian options, organic local all that jazz. OH MAN you have to eat their challah french toast. Sandra W and I arent much of a french toast fan, but we LOOOOVED it.I've been to Portage Bay 3 times now, and every time i get the Rancher's breakfast. So i cant say much about the other dishes, although, i see all the other orders every time i'm there and it looks amazing. I always tell myself "the next time, i'm getting that. or that one. i'm going to try something new" but i never do. i knwo what i like and i stick to it!minus one star for the splitting charge of $6. Then again, you cant blame them too much, especially when they have crazy diners like us that top their french toast till there is no french toast visible on the plate! So many options for a healthy eating lifestyle! &#160;Service is somewhat slow but worth the wait. &#160;The Banana's Foster french toast was amazing if you have a sweet tooth! My bf and I went in for brunch on a busy Saturday afternoon. &#160;We were told there would be a 25 minute wait, and it was about 25 minutes. &#160;Our server greeted us quickly, was friendly, and brought us our drinks right away.I got the french toast so I could head up to the fruit bar, and some poached eggs, he got ham and eggs. &#160;The french toast was fluffy, flavorful, and delicious! &#160;The fruit bar was wonderful, lots of fresh fruit and fresh whipped cream. &#160;Bf loved his food, he finished it before I could blink and said his was tasty.My poached eggs came out overcooked, and as soon as I mentioned it to our server she whisked them away to be re-done, and before I really noticed, I had new eggs dropped off.The food, in short, was fresh, delicious, and worth a measly 25 minute wait. &#160;The service was attentive, friendly, and not at all what some of these reviews claim - our server was awesome and I would ask for her personally again; but then all around me I saw servers stopping by tables, smiling, and keeping busy.My only dislike is the layout of the space - because Portage Bay is so popular, it is CRAMMED, and the tables are shoved so close together you have to keep your elbows tucked close to not whack someone next to you. &#160;A little more cozy than I prefer, but I will definitely be back (and request a window seat). So I decided to take my hungover girlfriend out for breakfast after a hard night of drinking, speakeasy's and various moments of indulgence. We both needed to delicious food to fill the aches in our bellies!I had heard tell of Portage Bay and was eager to see what the hoopla was all about. We got there around 12:30 p.m. and were greeted by a busy and well functioning staff. Both dinning rooms &#160;were full and the wait for a table was about 10 minutes (not bad by most estimations on a Saturday). While waiting, we saw several patrons taking advantage of the fruit bar and our mouths began to water. Everything was starting to look like the hype was not unfounded. Within that 10 minute estimate, we were seated and began to peruse the menu. I ordered black coffee, she ordered raspberry apple juice. We both decided on the Ranchers Breakfast, mine with fresh fruit, bacon, scrambled eggs and french toast, hers with the fried potatoes instead of the fruit. When the food arrived we quickly went to the fruit bar and went a little wild with our french toast toppings. Blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, black berries, whip cream, syrup and sliced almonds! Overall, the food was delicious, the service was good and we had a great time. I cleaned my plate and she got a to-go box for her leftovers. I am impressed with their ethos and how they strive to be as organic and local as possible. I'd like to go when they are less busy to see how much more attentive the wait staff can be, but on a Saturday I can't expect perfection. Other than that, zero complaints and lots of high praise. If you haven't been here, you've got some splainin' to do! &#160;This place is the BEST!Everything is locally grown/farmed and all organic. &#160;Their motto is 'Eat like you give a damn' (about your body, the environment, your fellow man etc.) and their food definitely proves that they do give a damn.I haven't tried everything yet (partially because I'm a vegetarian, partially because I love what I have tried so much I'm hard-pressed to try something new), but here's what I will say:Goat Cheese Omlette---awesomeGreek Omelette-----awesomeGranola Parfait----awesomeMigas---awesomeBuckwheat Pancakes---awesomeLemon Curd French Toast-----the best breakfast of my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Quesadillas ----awesomeSpinach Salad (minus the bacon) ----awesomeCeasar Salad with Tofu ----awesomeGive this place a try. &#160;They serve breakfast all day and have a toppings bar with organic fruit and homemade whipped cream for pancakes and granola. &#160; &#160;It's take all you want, but eat all you take :) I love their food here and have always had great service even though they're always busy. Once we were waiting for a friend at our table who was 30 minutes late, I thought we might get kicked out but the waitress was still really nice so we left her a huge tip. I usually order breakfast food and they've always given generous portions. I like coming here in the summer too when it's warm so I can sit outside. The food is a lil pricier but it's because everything is local and organic and it's worth it! I love their french toast and they have a little bar set up with tons of toppings which are unlimited. Wish they were open all day but it's just a breakfast/lunch joint so it's understandable. I love this place its so delicious! I just wish it was a little more affordable but what do you expect with organic? What can I say that hasn't already been said? I love this place. When I went to UW and lived in the U-District, we spent many hungover mornings at this place. Everything I've had there from the breakfast toppings bar to the hot sandwiches are really good. I especially love the breakfast menu though, such as the crabcake benedict. I'm not usually that particular about eating organic, but sometimes I do try to buy things at the grocery store or eat at certain restaurants or order certain dishes that are. I like that so many of the dishes at Portage Bay feature fresh and organic ingredients. You don't have to be a vegan or vegetarian to appreciate that. Better yet, the restaurant has been this way long before the current trendy green movement. Years ago when I first started to come here (as I lived right around the corner), this place was wonderful with great service and awesome food. &#160;Lately I've moved away but managed to stay at the Inn and came back for breakfast/brunch twice --although it is just as busy as before, it's not as good as I recall and I have been here MANY times.I must say that things have changed. &#160;The graham cracker encrusted french toast is a huge plate which I am always able to share with another my date, but now there is a $5.50 sharing fee. &#160;Additionally if I want a trip to the breakfast bar (to get some fruit or toppings) that's another $5.50 on top of the $12 dish of three slices of challah bread. &#160;The bar now has canned, or frozen &amp; thawing instead of fresh fruit. &#160;I'm not sure what happened to the service, too. &#160;We ordered orange juice and waters, along with the expected silverware but never got them; so, after several inquiries so finally had to get up and ask the owners (who are still very very nice btw). &#160;So, since they were going to charge the four of us for sharing, we ordered separately. &#160;The greek omelet ($10.50) ordered was good, but the fillings were cut in half. &#160;The side order of french toast was average ($8.50), and Phil's breakfast ($8.50) was just o.k. &#160;Maybe it was just a bad, busy day, but for $50+ dollars for 4 people during brunch, not sure if we'll be back for awhile. Portage Bay Cafe is a great location tucked away near UW. My girlfriend brought me here during lunch and we had to wait about 45 minutes to get seated. Sipped on a latte and spoke with people around me while waiting. When I got our food it was amazing and everything is organic. You definitely must try out the french toast w/ trip to the fruit bar along with the eggs benedict. If you go there during an off-hour (around 9-11am) or when it's rainy you don't have to wait in line. This place is growing on me the more I go. I have no complaints about this place. &#160;Everything on the menu, from breakfast to lunch, is amazing. &#160;I am never disappointed. &#160;Expect to spend a little more for this meal, but the portion sizes are large and you are supporting local businesses. &#160;The chai tea was amazing. &#160;The toppings bar makes everything better. Too big for anybody but a teenage football player, but I had a nice vegetarian hash, though with an alarming 3 eggs. &#160; Needless to say I didn't eat it all. It was very crowded on Sunday morning but they do accept reservations, which seemed surprising considering the crowds. Luckily came here 10 minutes before they opened on weekday! &#160;I can see why this place would be jammed packed for brunch on weekends. &#160;There was already 8 people milling about outside wating for them to open at 7:30 am. &#160;Some of the many positives. &#160;If your into the whole organic/free range/sustainable food philosophy then this is your place for sure. &#160;For the amount that I eat, sometimes it makes me sleep better at night knowing my meat had a nice life before it ended up on my plate! &#160;Aside from that, the food is good and creative. &#160;I ended up with the Chicken sausage with fennel and manchego cheese scramble which was very good. &#160;I was eyeing the toppings bar for I guess the pancakes/waffles and or oatmeal and figured I would hit that next. &#160;The staff seemed nice and service was quick. &#160;Free parking if you can get it! One of the best brunch spots in Seattle. &#160;Back when we started going here, about 8 years ago, I would usually get pancakes with the breakfast bar. &#160;Now I usually go for the omelettes. &#160;My only complaint is that, especially in recent years, it has started to seem a bit greasy spoonish. &#160;That said, I like that it is vegetarian-friendly and has an emphasis on local ingredients and organic foods, and I'm definitely going to keep visiting when I'm in town. I met a friend this morning at the Portage Bay Cafe in the University District. We both ordered pumpkin spice lattes but he asked for a double shot. Me? Well, I had already had a cup of coffee before I got there and I am sensitive to caffeine--I am not ashamed to ask for decaf if I have already had my daily dose but in this case I asked for just a regular old single shot. &#160;When we were handed our drinks, my friend asked which one was the double and the badass barista replied, "They are ALL doubles." I was like, "Oh." So I drank the &#160;double &#160;that I didn't order because I really just wanted to hang with my friend who I had not seen in 2 years and did not want to waste time arguing with an opinionated barista. And now I am at work suffering from mild caffeine intoxication. There was also some weird crunchy stuff at the bottom of the cup. What was that? Aw yeah! This place is rocks. I've been twice. On the first trip, I had the Dungeness Crab Cakes Benedict and a coffee. Oh my goodness, it was amazing. Today, I went again and had the Bananas Foster French Toast. Holy mole it was spectacular. Challah bread french toast with Meyer's Rum Caramel sauce and warm bananas, plus whipped cream. I went through the toppings bar and added raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, maple syrup, and extra whipped cream. OUTSTANDING! Plus free parking! You can't beat that:) I like this great breakfast, brunch, and lunch place in the U District. Portage Bay Cafe is always crowded and there's a good reason. The food is amazing and I believe that all of the food is organic. If the sun is out you can take advantage of the outdoor seating. Otherwise, sit inside and enjoy the amazing food.The breakfast/brunch menu consists of many combinations of eggs (benedicts, scrambles, and omelettes), grains, and pancakes/waffles/french toast.. I've tried a number of eggs benedicts and scrambles and I've always been pleased.This is a great restaurant for food that's prepared with fresh organic ingredients. And by far my favorite breakfast and brunch restaurant in the Seattle area. I wish we &#160;had Portage Bay Cafe in Portland. Simply put, go there! Everything is tasty. Fresh fruit juice drinks. Berry compote challa french toast - battered in graham crackers I think. Honestly, anything is good. And, Suzanne is an amazing server. Ask for her section. She's not only excellent, she's in school full-time so a good person to support as well. FoodiesHere's the problem -I appreciate that that Portage Bay is much loved &amp; has been for awhile so expect the wait for both seats &amp; your meal if you don't arrive at opening; plus its loud and crowded; I dined alone &amp; sat at the bar near the front door &amp; there is a parade of people walking behind youBUT that doesn't forgive management's inability, by this point, to reliably figure out how to deliver hot food to my table [Was my server overworked?overwhelmed?] - I urge everyone to practice zero tolerance in this regard &amp; send all cold food back so they get the message...I had the Ranchers Breakfast [which, for the budget conscious, can definitely be split, assuming this is tolerated] for $13.00 + Tax 1.30 + Tip $2.00 = $16.30 - granted its an enormous portion - but my Scrambled Eggs [lukewarm eggs? put a cover over my dish, for Pete's sake!] &amp; Cinnamon Toast, though tasty, were tepid at best &amp;, at this price, that's unforgivable - so I don't see how this place is special or twice as good as your neighborhood Denny's.The Toppings Bar is a welcome addition;I think you are better off driving over to The Dish or Senor Moose in Ballard for your omelette fix... Went here for brunch with my cousin when I visited Seattle for Thanksgiving. &#160; I had the salmon omelette that came with a toast and roasted potatoes. &#160;Also had a huge mug of unlimited coffee. &#160;Good food but quite expensive. &#160; Very crowded place. My fiance and I go to Portage Bay Cafe almost every weekend. This is the best breakfast spot ever! Their slogan is "Eat like you give a damn!" They really do give a damn too. All organic, fair trade, and delicious! I would suggest the Migas or Eggs Benedict for a savory meal or try the Bananas Foster and Cinnamon french toast twister for a sweet tooth. Either way bring an appetite. They have a fresh fruit and whipped cream bar for your sweet stuff and oats, and they now have their own coffee roasted for them. I love this restaurant and I know you will too if you love good food. I really wish I like this place more, but I'm always disappointed by their service. I'm fairly easy going and usually don't mind waiting, but having to wait and then have service that is below expectations? No thanks, I'd rather spend my money elsewhere. Honestly, their food is so-so, but some of their staff members just don't seem to care, and that alone makes me not want to go back. I used to go here all the time, especially since it was one of the first places I was introduced to after moving to Seattle. &#160;That was back in 2006 when I was in school and rowing the ranchers breakfast always seemed like a good deal. &#160;And the pictures of friends all over the walls are always something nice to look at. &#160;Since this is not a five star, I guess I will start out by explaining why.1: There is no toast with the ranchers breakfast. &#160;I like my eggs poached, and with poached eggs (or almost any style of eggs) toast is a must. &#160;What should I do with all that delicious savory yolk? &#160;2: The price is pretty high for breakfast food that, while using quality ingredients, does not require any culinary training to create. &#160;Serafina is comparably priced for brunch.3: The wait is always out the door when I actually want to go there (i.e. mildly hungover on a Sunday at 11:30). &#160;The owner is a rowing enthusiast though and my party usually gets the next available table. &#160; But it must suck for everyone else....4: I feel like they are a little too proud of their local, seasonal (though not really) fare. &#160;"Eat like you give a damn" sounds way to preachy to me. &#160;Luckily, the list of things I like far exceeds this very nit-picky list.My personal favorite breakfast is the granola parfait with a healthy toppings bar visit and a coffee. &#160;By the way, the coffee here is excellently strong and flavorful. &#160;The granola parfait is a full, healthy meal as long as the whipped cream is avoided. &#160;A quick warning: The fiber and fruit of the parfait along with the strength of the coffee combines to create a potential disaster about thirty minutes after the meal. &#160;I have had the hilarious but stressful experience of rushing to the nearest restroom along with three friends who all ordered the same breakfast. &#160;It was a photo finish to say the least. &#160;There is a lack of good breakfast places in Seattle and Portage Bay Cafe fills a niche. &#160;Unfortunately nothing is surprising or pleasantly unexpected about the food. &#160;Except for one duck and lobster mushroom omelet. &#160;I have been here bunch of times for lunch and it is also pretty tasty, relatively healthy, but not remarkable. &#160;The Niciose salad is pretty good, as are the burgers. &#160;Again, kind of pricey.
Absolute love the fruit bar idea, creative, fun and interactive. &#160;Service = the last couple times i've been here, I had to wave down the waitress, considering the limited amount seating service should not be a problemAmbiance = Great location, nice setup especially before a big game! &#160;Go dawgs!Food = Everything I've tried has been spectacular!Crowd = good mixed of students, professionals, familiesPrice = $$, a bit pricey for breakfastFavorite = &#160;the high ceiling, loud noises, and outdoor seating during summer. &#160;Worst = Service is the only reason that I can't give it a 5 starMeal for two = 40Final Say = If you have the money and don't mind the wait, go for it! Portage Bay is our favorite place for breakfast or lunch- or catering! The freshness of their food, the expansive and fantastic menu for sweet or savory (and really healthy!) options is just outstanding. &#160;It's always great to know that they use locally grown foods as much as possible too. I have never gone wrong with anything here.CATERING is also outstanding! &#160;Portage Bay catered our wedding, several hours outside of Seattle and two hundred people, last September. &#160;We did not use a wedding planner, and Amy and all her staff were absolutely invaluable in our planning, preparation and coordination. &#160;The execution was not only seamless, invisible, flawless, but truly added to our day. We STILL have friends and family who comment on how amazing the food was, and how wonderful the staff (who ever remembers food from a wedding?). Our favorite place in Seattle- hands down! We're excited there are now TWO places to visit them! Super yum! &#160;This is one of those super packed, get on the wait list, big-portioned and big-priced deliciousness, weekend breakfast hot spots. &#160;Locally foraged fiddlehead fern and mushroom omelette was the special, and that should tell you almost everything you need to know about Portage Bay. &#160;I'm on sort of a locavore kick, so I dig PB. &#160;My ever discerning husband posed a few ponderous questions, as he is wont to do when anxiously awaiting hangover breakfast: - Since everything here is organic, why isn't there organic Tobasco? &#160;There must be some kind of organic hot sauce that would fit the bill. &#160;"Consistency," he says, "that's all I ask."- Don't they have regular sugar for your coffee? &#160;All that's on the table is Sugar in the Raw and Splenda. &#160;To him, 5 stars is a freely flowing, white sugar pourer on every table.- Where the F are the biscuits and gravy? &#160;For a menu with such impressive heft and girth, he thought there was surely room for this staple. &#160;Why not make it with local Cascioppo sausage in the gravy, since that's clearly how Portage Bay rolls.Someone's gotta ask the tough questions. &#160;And it wasn't gonna be me, with my mouth crammed full of Crab Cake Eggs Benedict. Very delicious and worth the wait.We ventured out for a yummy breakfast with baby in tow. &#160;I forgot this place was close to the University, so of course on the weekend expect the hangover-let's-gorge-after-drinking-cheap-beer crowd. &#160;Luckily for us, the staff were super kind and bumped us up on the list because of the little one. &#160;And they also gave us a nice big table so we could spread out. &#160;They totally embrace cute kids here. &#160;I guess it's from staring at weary college kids all day. &#160;You would much rather be nice to someone that just drools and coos.The food is absolutely lovely. &#160;They make me want to cook organic all the time. &#160;It makes such a huge difference. &#160;The french toast is hardy, the fruit ripened perfectly with no chemical aftertastes in their berries and bananas! &#160;And their crab Benedict is such a rich indulgent treat. &#160;The little one loved their toast and juice.We will definitely be back and be taking visitors here. &#160;It's one of those places you want to show off about your city. &#160;My only complaint would be, they need to expand. &#160;They definitely have the clientle but the space is getting small even with the outdoor area. Breakfast/ BrunchCreative, but taste/portion is just ok. I love a good breakfast or brunch, and this is a great place for it. The portions of tasty food are ginormous and the sweet and savory options are numerous. I don't even like sweet stuff in the morning, but the french toast here is to die for. The only reason this isn't a five star is that I'm not a fan of their potatoes, and potatoes are one of my most favorite parts of going out for breakfast. They make herbed red potatoes instead of traditional hash browns and they never taste quite right to me. They're not terrible, but not great.Portage Bay gets quite crowded on the weekends, so be ready to wait for a table, or make reservations if you have a large group. Okay, I have lived in the Seattle area for 2 years now, and there's something that my friends and I comment about on a regular basis. &#160;The fact that really lackluster restaurants often get good reviews.Portage Bay Cafe is one of those places.We got there and waited for about 50 minutes (we were told 20), and while being outside, we perused the menu. &#160;Very promising. &#160;Finally, they sat us right by the back door, which is always open apparently to let the kitchen get the cart of dirty dishes which is filled right by the "toppings bar" (we'll come back to that). Then it gets dragged out the back door and a new, empty cart returns. &#160;Apparently in Seattle, we have the weather to allow the doors to be open all the time. &#160;I finally shut it, but had to do it another time after they filled the next cart.The food was edible. &#160;Nothing special. &#160;I liked that it's all organic. &#160;But the flavors were muted. &#160;I had the flat iron steak omelette. &#160;My friend got the crab cakes Benedict. &#160;It was so depressing. &#160;It looked like a boiled eyeball and we think it sat for awhile because the hollandaise sauce either walked off or it got soaked up in his English muffin. &#160;My husband got the french toast, which was pretty darned good. &#160;Both of them received a side of eggs and potatoes that were ICE cold. &#160;"Brown-rubbery eggs." &#160;They came and replaced them promptly. &#160;And they tasted OOOOOKAAAAAYYYYY when hot. &#160;Are they afraid of seasoning, here, or something?Finally, my husband's trip to the toppings bar was equally ho-hum. &#160;Just chopped up fruits, some fresh and some frozen, and a bowl of whipped cream. &#160;Eh.Over-all, I must have missed the magic that so many others have experienced. &#160;Or maybe the Labor Day crunch stressed them to the point of breaking.2 Stars .... 2.5 maybe because the support AM1090, and use all organics. My favorite for brunch! Hope you're not in a hurry when your planning to eat brunch here on the weekend- there is always a wait for tables but trust me, you won't be disappointed!! But since the South Lake Union location opened it may be less crowded!?All organic &amp; fresh ingredients. Everything I've eaten here so far is money.It's always a toughie to choose what I want to eat: omelettes, pancakes, scrambles, eggs benedict, just eggs, bacon, and hash browns...omg and the bananas foster french toast! These are only a few options out of many. PLENTY. :)**Toppings Bar! Fresh fruit, syrups, butter, whipping cream to dollip over your pancakes or french toast It's not tough to get me to love a restaurant, as long as the food is tasty and they clearly mark the gluten-free items -- or especially if they single them out and make it seem like they made them specifically for you. I was really excited to discover that our hotel in Seattle, the University Inn (which was decent, by the way), was next-door to this place once I looked at the menu. Everything is fresh and organic, they have a really extensive and yummy-looking breakfast menu, and the prices are quite inexpensive for the massive portions of food they give you. Although all the scrambles looked really tasty, I HAD to try one of the gluten-free pancake options (they have buckwheat or rice flour). I've had rice flour pancakes before, so opted for buckwheat. Two huge pancakes bigger than my head arrived at my table, slathered with honey butter. They were nutty and tasty, almost chocolatey -- and the serving came with a trip to the "toppings bar," a table laden with fresh and preserved fruits, more butter, whipped cream and so on. I got a couple of eggs on the side as well, and couldn't finish my food. The leftover 'cakes made a great snack later. Unfortunately, I have to ding them a little because the service was so-so -- while we got everything we asked for, the waitress was slow (as was the cashier the next day when I came back for a cup of tea to go) and seemed unfamiliar with the idea that it's good to bring menus, utensils and so on to your hungry patrons. Still, the 'cakes made me feel very loved. I'd definitely come back here -- though perhaps on a weekday when there isn't a line out the door. OH THANK YOU YELP!!! We woke up at the buttcrack of dawn... (literally since it felt like sunrise and sunset are obscenely early and late up here in Seattle!) and wandered out to have breakfast. I busted out my trusty smartphone and meandered over to the Yelp mobile site and found us a 4 star 90+ review place. 15 minute drive later with the crappy Magellan GPS system, we found ourselves a parking spot and the last available table at Portage. The service was prompt and friendly and the menu looked amazing!! It seemed like it was a place that was really jumping on the local specialties/organic bandwagon. They did a great job with it and melded the menu beautifully. I ordered a fiddlehead fern with crimini mushroom omelette and S got some kind of apple chicken sausage scramble. I was really eyeing the pancakes and french toast since they have this amazing topping bar filled with oodles of fruits and yogurt for you to top off your pancakes and french toast. Unfortunately after seeing some fellow patrons with their overly browned pancakes standing in line to use the topping bar, I ended up with the omelette. The fresh squeezed apple juice was kick ass and my breakfast was made perfectly!! I wasn't too fond of their country potatoes as they were overly generous with the thyme. I also had to add some salt to it as it kind of had a sweet aftertaste. Overall... it is a must go to place... Can't wait to hit it up again next time I'm in Seattle!!! We were there at 9am on a sleepy Saturday and the line was out the door when we were finishing up... Wow... if the place can fill up like that for breakfast on a Saturday...... I was in the overflow room- but totally ok with it because then I didn't have to wait too long for food while looking at others eat... and it was Easter. I know going on Easter was probably not the best- but I had to fit multiple parents into the day and Portage opens at 8am. We must have frustrated the server because we took forever to decided on our orders because of an overflow of options that sounded delicious... he held his cool though. I caved and did the Bananas Foster (based on a Yelper's suggestion) and WOW! The bread was perfect and not over soaked, the bananas half cooked and wonderful, and the caramel sauce somehow had the right amount of sweetness without being overwhelming or keeping me from finishing off the plate. I was so stuffed that I didn't even take advantage of my free pass to the fruit and toppings bar. Did I mention that the whipped cream was beyond fresh. My father and brother also loved what they ordered with my father constantly trying to get everyone to taste his veggies out of the hash. Somehow an organic celery piece tastes so much better. The fresh sheet pancakes were a winner with the brother a picky 19 yr old. The restaurant lists were they source their ingredients from on the wall and most is local or organic. Portage Bay elevated my standards for organic, healthy, or local dishes. I like knowing where my food is coming from and what is in my dish. In basic... YUM... I have found a favorite and I will so be back to try the pumpkin pancakes. The only downside is the crowding and locations road access... We couldn't even get out because it was so jammed that people had nowhere to step to so we could pass. Healthy and huge portions, this place is great. The lines can get very long but that's only because the food is unanimously delicious. The price is reasonable for the quality of the foot you'll get. Given that's it's organic doesn't diminish the taste of anything. I couldn't tell if it really made anything better but it sure made me feel like I was eating healthier. Also made me feel in a small way that I was bettering the world, like picking up litter, petting a cow, or giving a tree a huge. This place really does belong in Seattle. I went here for brunch with my friend and it was amazing! The place was filled but the wait wasn't too bad, the food delectable, and the service timely.Food: I had the greek omelet with fresh fruit and can you say delicious? Perfectly sauteed baby spinach, onions, feta in 3 organic eggs. I inhaled the whole thing with the help of tabasco &amp; ketchup. The fresh fruit included raspberries, pineapple, blueberries, and watermelon. Mmmm. My friend got the dungeness crab benedict with potatoes and man it looked great. He ate it in about 2 minutes. Service: For such a busy &#160;place, the service was great. We only waited 5-10 minutes to be seated, then our waitress was right with us. We got our lattes in 2 minutes, tops, and our food in about 6. Wow. She also managed to split out bill even though it was super confusing. She was a little detached but very friendly and timely.Price: Okay, so I paid $20 for brunch. Yeah, it's a lot. But still, for a treat for a guest or an occasional splurge, so worth it. Ambiance: Noisy; there's a lot of people. They have a heated patio but it wasn't heated today so we sat inside. The toppings bar taunted us in its closeness. You can smell the food cooking since the chefs are right in the small space with you. My throat was sore from talking (because I talk a lot and I had to talk loudly) but it was fun. Go here if you're in the Udistrict for breakfast/lunch! Well worth the wait and the price. Plus, everything is organic. I was visiting my brother for awhile in Seattle, and he and his girlfriend took me to Portage Bay.Living in the South, there are NO organic restaurants, besides the Rainbow Grocery. &#160;If you asked any typical Mississippian if there were any organic food selections in the area, the reply you would get would be, "you g'ddamn libAHrals, there ain't no wAIY in HAIL you be putten a good-foh-nuttin,' hippie EET place in our fine state."Anyway, the food was incredible!I ordered Phil's Breakfast and loved every bit of it.The staff was wonderful, and the atmosphere was great!There was a little bit of a wait, but it was definitely worth it.If there was a place like Portage Bay in Mississippi, I would eat there every morning, no matter how far of a drive it would be. First, this restaurant probably deserves three stars. &#160;I'm giving it two to try to counteract the currently inflated total. &#160;The Portage Bay Cafe is one of the most overrated restaurants in Seattle. &#160;I live close by, and weekend mornings there's always a long line out the door.The restaurant is the equivalent of a web site back in the days before Google that repeated important keywords in a large font to trick the search engines. &#160;Look, I have no objection to organic food, but organic isn't always a surrogate for healthy, and healthy food is what you really want, right? &#160;Everything I've ever had at this restaurant was about four times as greasy as it should have been. &#160;Even the salad I once had was greasy.On second thought, my analogy is pretty bad, just like the restaurant. RED ALERT: Portage Bay Cafe is now serving breakfast all day long. &#160;This is very important to us folks who like to stay out all night and can only pry themselves out of bed to get food around 3pm when most places have already stopped serving breakfast.The scrambles are very simple but oh so good. &#160;Combined with the spicy potatoes they have and I am in heaven. &#160;One day I will try the pancake/waffle bar goodness lined with many different fruits and sauces. My favorite breakfast place!!!! Best pics:- Banana foster french toast..... made with rum and challah bread with fresh fruit and berry all u can eat bar and good homemade whipped cream.. - Seasonal mushroom omelet... when this is on the special menu, get it-Eggs benedict with crab... yummy!-Curry, seafood omelet... I'm sorry to rate them so poorly. I was really looking forward to eating here after the reviews I read. So here's my story:I made reservations Fri. morning knowing they'd be busy for Mother's Day. This wasn't a mom's day meal but a belated birthday breakfast with my dad. Got the res. for 9am no problem.We arrived a bit early and I was told there wasn't a res. under my name- could it be under another? Um..no I always reserve under my first name. So they wrote us in...30+ mins after my 9am time we finally get seated. I had to check in twice since walk-ins were being seated before us. If I called in days ahead and made a reservation I should have priority over any walk in! I wasn't happy.Our waitress was nice and quickly took our drink order and delivered them promptly. No problems with her service at all. However, our order arrived in barely 5 mins. She said "They're quick back there". We ordered off the day's specials, my dad a crab omlette and french toast for me. My dish was cold! I took 3-4 bites before deciding to send it back. It wasn't just warm or lukewarm, it was room temp like it'd been sitting. The waitress brings me a new dish and it's barely any warmer. I didn't complain a second time- didn't want anything funky in my breaky. My dad's omlette must've been okay- he didn't complain and I saw steam rising, so I knew it was hot at least.But I must say I'm still dissapointed. I've done meals out on Mother's Day (Cafe Campagne, Cafe on the Terrace, ect.) and never had such a bad time of it. From other reviews I can't belive this is the norm but I probably won't try them again. Too many other good breaky places. I'm not going to go on and on about the food and the wait and the service and the organics and the blahblahblah....I just want to share one anecdote.After waiting for the first forty five minutes in sleet, gripping what was once a hot cup of coffee I turned to the street. What I saw was one of those glorious traffic moments. A mid nineties caddy floating down the street at a casual 15 mph with a BMW SUV swerving back and forth, desperately trying to race past the grandma. after a long block the guy held down his horn in what could only be described as "a dick move."The host poked his head out and shouted with a defiant "20 to 30 minutes!!!!" at the car, shaking his fist.I couldn't help but laugh and coincidentally, the guy looked our way and we were seated.It was a pretty triumphant moment in an odd way.Bah I gotta mention the food. Briefly, -Toppings bar = super lame pie fillings (looked canned??)-Did not enjoy sausage.-French toast was outstanding.Not even close to worth the wait. Reservations don't seem to make a difference, but they do take them. We were visiting Seattle from out of town and as we were heading to our hotel room in the elevator, we were given advice from a random couple - go to Portage Bay Cafe for breakfast. "Trust us, you will love us forever even though you don't know us" they said. If anyone ever says that to you, I urge you their advice is driven by passion for something really good. We went to Portage Bay Cafe the next day and we weren't disappointed.The staff were friendly and accommodating. When we asked our waitress her what her favourite dishes were, you could see the love she had for the food on her face - it is rare that the wait-staff believe in their menu so much. We mostly took her advice and the table of 4 each chose a savoury dish and we shared a mixed berry and graham cracker french toast as a "sweet finish". Everything was perfect including the special apple and raspberry chapagne cocktails that accompanied our meal. The outdoor seating was comfortable and added to the ambiance. For organic, in season food, the prices were extremely reasonable. This is a must visit when you go to Seattle. If you were the couple in the lift at Hotel Deca, thank you, you know who you are!!! With so many positive reviews from so many Yelpers, it had to be good (Wisdom of Crowds theory). &#160;So we had to try.I should've seen there was a location closer to where we were staying.Oh well, it gave us a reason to check out the University District of Seattle and the University of Washington.The experience:A half hour wait became more like an hour wait.The pork sausage omelet with Gouda was meh: too dry and not enough sausage.The Berry Blintzes were pretty good and almost made the wait worth it.The Toppings Bar was the coolest thing about this place. &#160;When I first saw some folks walking towards the kitchen with their plates in hand, I thought they were going to try to return their food. &#160;That would've been fun to watch. &#160;Anyway, I made sure to pile on the berries and whip cream on the blintzes to give it an extra berry kick. &#160;It worked.Was the experience worth waiting an hour good? &#160;Maybe not an hour wait, but it's worth trying at least once.It's a good breakfast place. &#160;It'd be even better if you timed it just right and only have to wait 15 minutes max. Uhm.................. &#160;LOVE! &#160;Seriously, there doesn't seem to be a bad dish here. &#160;Breakfast; you HAVE to try the challah french toast. &#160;Includes UNLIMITED fresh fruit/fresh whipped cream/real maple syruyp/creamed butter. &#160;Also, it's the BEST french toast I've had!I love that they use locally grown and distributed organic foods and beverages. &#160;Discovered Annie's organic ketchup; the most brilliant ketchup known to man. &#160;The best part is their motto: Eat like you give a damn.I do believe that I will be dragging everyone that I know, friend or foe, to this place for breakfast. &#160;Drunken French Toast, here I come!!! Eat here. If the little things matter - well chosen &amp; cooked ingredients, prep, presentation, quality in every detail - Eat here.Only problem, victims of their own success. &#160;The place is crowded, waits are common &amp; long. &#160;Food can take some time, as well as the bill - servers are wonderful, just terribly busy. &#160;They opened up a 2nd location, so hopefull the crowds will spread out a bit.Did I mention...Eat here. I went with a friend who prefers to eat organic/vegetarian. I'm fine with paying a few extra $ for good organic food, but these people have NO right to charge the amount they do for their food! I ordered a side of fruit instead of hashbrowns, as I always do anywhere, and what do I get?! CANNED/FROZEN fruit! WTF!!! I can go to a F@$*!ing Denny's and at least get FRESH fruit. The last place on Earth I expected to get the shaft on good produce was Portage Bay, the infamous organic cafe`. Anyway, I will most likely never go there again. The injustice! Great savory and sweet breakfast options. Migas are VERY tasty.The potatoes that come with the dishes need to be worked on.Be prepared for a wait on saturday and sunday mornings. Very tasty brunch. &#160;Migas were excellent (and huge), and french toast was delicious. &#160;Friendly service. &#160;Gets crowded fast, so get there early or be prepared to wait. My bf and i decided to check out this place out one morning after 4 years of living near the restaurant. We'd drive by every weekend and see crowds of people standing outside waiting for a table. Everything on the menu looked delicious and best of all everything you get is organic! Also, a super duper bonus is the fruit topping table where you can pile on all the toppings you can fit on your dish. I got the scramble with chorizo sausage and it was dlish!! I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a place to gather with friends/family. The caveat is to come early or call in to make reservations. This is one of my favorite places to go eat breakfast at. &#160;I love how all the food is so simple but so much flavor! &#160;The Omelets and scrambles are yummy. &#160;My favorite are the french toast with the berries. &#160;MMMM.... And the portions are big that you'll be more than satisfied! &#160;oh and you'll have fun with the topping bar too! Watching all the food go by at breakfast, I was definitely thinking this was a 4-5 star place. The sweet dishes of pancakes, french toast with the fresh fruit bar toppings looked amazing. Alas, I'm more of a savory fan- so I was thinking eggs. My roommate was there with me and thought the veggie hash sounded good- with 3 eggs on top, what could be more perfect? &#160;Well, actually, it was probably the most disappointing breakfast I've ever had. Partially, it was my own fault. I didn't realize the eggs would be scrambled (I had in mind over easy gooing into a nice hash of thinly sliced bits of potato sauteed with mushrooms, but since i wasn't asked how I would like my eggs and I didn't read it so closely, I take the blame here). &#160;BUT, whatever they're thinking when they named this dish a "hash" is what I'm wondering. The potatoes were small wedges, the sautee was a stir-fry. The eggs were completely over-done and just plopped over it. Tasteless. It didnt' even look appealing. My face was a sad site when it arrived, sadder after a few bites. I didn't come close to finishing, which is unusual for me. There was no composition, no way in hell anyone who made the dish actually ever ate it. It made no sense! &#160;It's breakfast food, i know, it's not some feast but hello, in this day and age of Top Chef and Iron Chef, I've come to have some expectations. And if I can make the dish, better just by imagining it - with just the name in mind, and make myself drool, what are they thinking?! Were they thinking?Fortunately, my roommate's dish was better- the coconut curry shrimp omelette. &#160;Although under-seasoned, it was more on par with the description. So, in any case, my recommendation would be to go sweet- I was sorely sad that I wasn't in a sweet mood that morning. The fresh fruit bar looked amazing and the other patrons all seemed to know what was up. For eggs, go elsewhere. The breakfasts here are so freaking good I want to punch myself in the face! AND, get this, they have gluten-free pancakes. I have never seen a restaurant with that option before, and I almost soiled myself when I saw it on the menu. As someone who is allergic to wheat, it was increadibly enjoyable to have pancakes for breakfast. I also have tried the herb-roasted potatoes (super yummy!), the bacon, and the chicken sausage as sides, which are all wonderful. The real experience is getting pancakes or waffles though, and then piling them up with fruit and syrup from the toppings bar. Oh, the coffee and OJ is pretty darn good here as well.Weekend mornings are packed at the U-District location, but lucky for Seattle they recently opened another location in South Lake Union with the same fab menu. I may have to go to the new location next time and see if the weekend brunch line is shorter.To summarize: I love the Portage Bay Cafe and the food they have there - especially the gluten-free pancakes. I took my family here for mothers day brunch and went to the one that just opened in South Lake Union for my first time - I think it lived up to its hype. My mom ordered the crab cakes and I had an omelette (forget which one). My baby cousin loved their fruit bar - she kept wanting to go back for more. The space was big and the decorations were nice. Overall atmosphere was perfect for brunch. And with all their products being organic and sustainable gave me a pleasantly surprising benefit for eating there. The toppings bar for the pancakes and french toast is top shelf. &#160;You only get to go through it one time, but you can stack it deep on the one pass (fresh berries, mixed berry compote, syrups, whipped cream, apples, the whole nine). &#160;chicken, basil sausage is grade a. &#160;this stuff is kinda dry at most places. &#160;At Portage Bay, it has virtually the texture of regular italian sausage links. &#160;There can be a wait, but you can usually game it by asking to sit in the back room which has pretty much the same view as the main dining area or sitting outside. &#160;Wait staff is friendly. &#160;oh yeah the pancakes and french toast are both outstanding toppings bar or not--definitely not a greasy spoon kinda joint. Down with naysayers! PBC is quite possibly the best place I've ever eaten and would eat there every day if I had the money to blow. They offer counter seating for those who are impatient and don't mind not sitting at a table; three course breakfasts with a delicious berry bar (their lunches are excellent too); fare for vegans/vegetarians/carnivores/omnivores/pickyvores&#173;; a friendly and sympathetic waitstafft that has let me eat for free on at least two occasions, and reasonably good prices for all that. Enough written. Best damn breakfast ever. I love their french toast. Whenever I'm in town, I make sure to go to Portage Bay. Oh and the waffle/fruit bar is amazing.I knocked it down a star because I hate the wait and that you can never make reservations. The food was spectacular! The coffee, was perfect. The mimosa's, were totally rock and roll. The service...well, what can one say when it takes 15 min. just to get coffee. Super slow service. The waitress looked like she had no help and the bus boy wasn't interested in picking up any slack. I will absolutely eat here again, I just may load up on a few cups of joe before I venture out. By the way, if you eat gluten free, the rice pancakes are perfect. Nothing to complain about there. Also, we had the mushroom hash, so good. The cinnamon twist french toast had people moaning and the topping bar was super fun for the kids. By the way, they don't give you a kids menu but you can ask for the Mickey Mouse shaped pancake.Go there, Just be prepared to wait, the food is worth it. I really don't understand the rave reviews about this place. &#160;It seems like they are using very high quality ingredients. &#160;And I have to say that the orange juice was clearly fresh squeezed and was outstanding. &#160;But the menu was totally uninspired and ho hum. &#160;My husband and I both ordered egg dishes. &#160;Mine was fine but definitely not "good" and his was actually a little bad. &#160;I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone for anything EXCEPT for a great glass of orange juice. I went here because of all the wonderful reviews, but I was quite disappointed. &#160;Service was better than I expected maybe because it was on a weekday, although the server put whip cream despite my very very emphatic request to skip it. &#160; I had the berry blintz and of course, the much loved fruit bar. &#160;I couldn't eat more than half of the blintz, but piled up on the fruits. &#160;I thought the food was ok, but my stomach really didn't like it. &#160;I don't know what it was, but I had indigestion all day long and felt like crap. expensive and over rated. &#160;not sure why it is quite so popular, sure the toppings bar is nice but the food is quite ordinary.
Be careful!!! This place does bad things to your debit card!!!Two of us went to this place yesterday noon. Food is below average but later experience is worse.We had lunch buffet. After tax, the waiter charged me 9.85 and my friend 8.95. This is the first weird thing since we paid separately for same buffet!My friend gave one dollar tip in cash and crossed out the tip when signed the receipt, today his bank account shows that there is 10.95 dollar charge. The waiter charged two dollars tips more. This is the second weird thing.As I mentioned, the food is just ok. I didn't write down any tip because in buffet I served myself. I just signed my name and left rest blank. I assume that they should not fill out tip themselves. However, today my bank account shows that I have been charged 11.85. Apparently they filled out 2 dollars tip themselves! This is the third weird thing.I am not sure their behaviors: charge different prices for same order; change tip amount; fill out tip themselves are appropriate or even legal. I can't believe we are forced to pay five dollars tip in this way! Shame on Garam Masala! I will never go there again. Wow, lots of hate for this place in the reviews. &#160;Granted, most of it seems to revolve around coupons, card payments and gratuity. &#160;I've never noticed anything amiss, but then I don't tend to pay attention too closely as long as the amounts look about right.As far as the food goes, this is the best Indian I've had in the U District out of at least 5 places. &#160;The prices are less than Shalimar and the portions are larger and the food is better. &#160;It is a big on the small side and there isn't anything fancy about the decor. &#160;If that's what it takes to get better food for less then I'm all in every time. Summary: good food, terrible service.I adore Garam Masala's palak paneer and lamb korma - once I tried those, I stopped ordering anything else besides those two dishes - but their delivery service is terrible. &#160;I only get my food about 2/3 of the time when I order through foodler; the rest of the time, the driver is out or sick or traveling or has a broken car or... something. &#160;They don't always call to let you know, either.I've also observed that the amount of meat in my meat dishes has been decreasing in the year or so since I've started ordering from them. &#160;It's a pity, because I really like their lamb korma, but I can't get two meals out of one order any more like I used to. If you go for the lunch buffet at Garam Masala, you have no excuse for coming out hungry. Well, unless you hated everything they have, but that's not likely. There are already a lot of Indian buffets on the Ave, and this one is really nothing special in comparison, but it's still good enough that I have to give a positive review. The service is attentive, the naan is complimentary as always, and there is a lot of food you can get for $8.95 plus tax. The place from what I saw seemed fairly clean.The rice is interesting; it's long and has some orange pieces in it that I can only assume is carrot. Everything else is pretty standard. Their curries range anywhere from okay to good. The potato slices in particular are very good, but the chicken seems very dry and probably left heated for too long. They have a sizable selection for vegetarians, and their desserts are also great. Overall, a good small restaurant that doesn't appear to have any major problems. My wife and I bought a Groupon for this restaurant a few weeks ago ($20 value for $10), and went there for dinner yesterday around 6 pm. She got there first, and I hunted for parking. (I got lucky, and found a metered spot about a block away.) No one was there when we arrived, but others trickled in while we were eating.My wife ordered nan for us, and it was very good. The sauces were good; the sweet sauce and the hot sauce were on different sides of the same little saucer, and ran together a bit when we dipped.We got tea also. It was fine.For the main course, I ordered chicken biryani, medium hot. My wife ordered chicken tikka masala, hot. Different restaurants do different things with food hotness; often ethnic restaurants adjust their scales depending on whether a customer looks like someone of the restaurant's ethnicity, and tones it down a bit for others. I delicately mentioned that to the waitress, and both our dishes were just as spicy as we expected it.Both dishes tasted good too. My wife's was a bit too hot for me to have more than a taste, but I did try it out. The heat built up gradually.The problem with the food was that both chicken entrees seemed very light on chicken. Sure, they weren't getting paid much because of the Groupon discount, but if they're trying to show off their stuff for a first-time customer they should be doing their best rather than giving us half as much chicken as most Indian restaurants serve in the same dishes.The server was very pleasant, and fairly on-the-ball. She said she had only been there for two weeks, but that wasn't obvious.As for the star rating, I am giving them the benefit of the doubt on the too-little chicken, since the whole tab was only about $4 after the credit for the Groupon. I might not be so happy if I had paid full price. I didn't notice the automatic 18% gratuity others have mentioned, but maybe I wasn't paying attention, and I tipped the waitress on the full tab. I wish I would have read the reviews first.... I'm not sure if I was taxed that extra 18%.I ordered the garlic naan &amp; okra &amp; chicken entree. The food was okay - the service was not.I'm used to getting served the naan first - but the waiter came out with my main dish. I then asked for the naan and when I ordered I asked if it came with chutney - the waiter said yes. When he brought the naan - there was no chutney - I figured he'd be bringing it out shortly. He came out several times, but never returned to my table. (there were only 2 other tables occupied while I was there) I finally got up and went to the kitchen window &amp; asked for the chutney.When we were done my son asked for dessert - I noticed ice cream on the menu and I didn't feel like going to another place with my 3 year old - so we ordered the mango ice cream.... DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!!! I don't think they've served that ice cream in quite some time - it was frozen SOLID. No joke. I had to use a knife to cut the ice cream in small pieces in order to make it edible. I won't be back - too many other great places in the U District to pass up. If I could rate this restaurant NO STARS, I would. A year ago, after a long plane trip we came home starving and ordered delivery from them. An HOUR LATER we called them wondering where the order was...apparently the person who took our order never filled it so they didnt have food for us. We ordered again....ANOTHER HOUR LATER we called back asking AGAIN where our food was and they said they had stopped delivery for the night, without calling to tell us anything!Then today, thinking we could give them another chance a year later because their rating is so high on yelp, we ordered delivery through http://Eat24.com. AN HOUR LATER we received an email saying they are "sorry for the inconvenience...we cannot perform any deliveries at the moment."I AM SO PISSED OFF that they seem incapable of accomplishing a delivery even though they keep saying they are an indian food delivery place! NEVER ORDER FROM THEM. You will not get food, just really crappy service and lack of any accountability. Quick overview of their lunch buffet: &#160;excellent channa masala and aloo baingan with a perfect balance of spices for each dish, delicious and plentiful basmati rice, decent curry chicken (from what I tried; most of it was gone by the time I came to eat there), tasty (complimentary) naan, and killer mango chutney. Tried the gulab jamun and wasn't overly impressed (Jewel of India and Cedars make better versions, in my opinion) but it's not horrible or anything. Staff are very, very friendly. I like the food at this place, but they REALLY need to get their customer service together. The husband and I went for lunch 3 weeks ago. We didn't order anything fancy or complicated, yet we watched 4 other tables that were seated after us get food first. Our appetizers and our main dish came out at the same time, and my husband had to ask for his chai repeatedly beofre they remembered it. I chalked it up to them being busy. These things happen. Fast forward to last night, I had friends over to visit me because I'm recovering from an illness, and we all thought it would be nice to order Indian food and watch some movies. I called them at 9:30, ready to place a HUGE order, and was told they weren't delivering. The restaurant closes at 11. I figured 9:30 was early enough. &#160;We were all super disappointed. My friends wound up leaving to go to the International District for Chinese. At this point, I'm pretty sure I'm not going to give Garam Masala another chance to upset me. I woke up late this morning and rushed to school without a single bite of breakfast, and suffered from a growling tummy up until 1 pm. As I wondered up the ave I wanted to get some Thai Tom but decided to drop into this place for their lunch buffet deal instead. Pretty good service and very friendly too. You get as much freshly made naan as you want with your buffet. The buffet line itself lacks a bit in the meat department and doesn't even have butter chicken, which in my opinion is a must have staple for indian cuisine...but that's okay cuz the food was hella tasty nonetheless. They have a bunch of masalas which are absolutely delicious..they also had some decent chicken masala as well as tandori chicken! Beware! I hauled my fatass into this place all arrogant thinking I could down three or more full plates. This stuff hits like a damn brick in ur gut with all the packed carbs...The second full plate kicked my ass....the only down side to the meal I could say was that some homeless guy who was also eating there had gotten up to wash his hands, and then came back standing behind me and swinging his arms back and forth for a full five minutes to dry them. I was like wtf r u doing u weirdo ur gettin water on me ! &#160;...anyways lunch came to out to about 10 bucks! not bad!
Reasons to not go here1) They add 18% gratuity to every check, regardless of party size or quality of service. I call this a scam, straight up.2) Not authentic Indian food. Several items were misnamed or just not made correctly. For example, I ordered a paratha (layered bread) and they just brought a naan with butter on it. It appears as if this restaurant is going out of business and desperate to make a quick buck. It might have been good in the past but its current state is sad. I won't be going back.Edit to respond to owners comments:1) Are you saying servers in other restaurants don't work hard?? Why don't all the other restaurants in U-District also add automatic 18% gratuity for serving just two people? The answer is : it's a scam.2) Your food is neither 100% traditional nor 100% authentic because both those things essentially mean the same. You are selling cheaper items in the guise of something that is usually much better. Also, I don't think you are an authentic Indian restaurant at all.3) YES you are desperate to make a quick buck. That's why you resort to these cheap scams that are fairly transparent to customers. And YES you will go out of business unless you turn yourself into an ethical establishment with better customer service. Naan.... I love Naan...and Garam Masala makes really good Garlic Naan. I've been here several times, mostly to satisfy my Naan cravings and Garam Masala makes my stomach happy...plus it's so close to school! They have pretty good service. Last time I just ordered food (actually it was just Naan) to go and sat down to wait for my order and they served me water for my wait. I thought that was a real nice gesture especially since I wasn't actually going to dine there and pay tip =/ Regardless, I was a happy camper. While I think their dishes are really good and full of flavor, I do wish they would serve more meat in their dishes. I feel like it's mostly curry and I'm stuck eating curry and rice for most of my dinner. Cafeteria tasting Indian foodParking: Ave. &#160;You've got to fight for it.Service: Got seated, then got blasted with windex - the waitress was spraying copious amounts of the cleaner all over the next table. &#160;I kept wondering if droplets were landing in our water. &#160;After we got our dinner, I groaned inwardly as the table on our other side emptied and the waitress with the blue bottle approached. &#160;Food tasted like windex for quite a while after that. &#160;Other than that, okay, not a lot of service going on, but the waitress seemed nice.Ambiance: Kinda chessy mish-mash, they didn't spend a lot of money here.Food: Rice - not Jasmine, not basmati, &#160;was it Uncle Ben's??? (Don't think they spent a lot of money here either). &#160;Butter chicken - have never quite had butter chicken like that before (and I've had LOTS before) - very, very sweet, and kind of a strange reddish color. &#160;It was okay - actually, I kind of liked the sweetness but my husband couldn't stand it. &#160;The Aloo Gobi - cauliflower &amp; potato dish was okay - I'm used to more spices in it, but at least this dish tasted more authentic Indian. &#160;Also had the lamb mango curry - don't get this one, it's heavy on the lamb taste and light on the mango taste - I wished it was the other way around. &#160;Naan was good.Recommendation: I think there's other nicer Indian places on the Ave - try those first. &#160;Otherwise I'd stick to the naan - to go. This place used to be my definite favorite for Indian food in the U District. They've tried to fancy up their restaurant over the last year or so, but it isn't working. At first, they had great food and good prices, served on paper plates, which was terrible for the environment, but modest and kind of cute. And they served beverages out of an old Quizno's drink case. But now they've got waiters in fancy black outfits, tablecloths, and bizarre decorations (what is with those creepy bronze statues??), and the food is basically the same, but every few months, it seems like they jack up the price a dollar, without any additional quality.They offer coupons every single month in valpak, and each quarter in this coupon book that students get at the UW bookstore, and they have a yelp deal now too, but they seem frustrated at allowing people to use them. If you don't want people to use coupons at your restaurant, don't hand them out so freely!The food was worth it when it was almost all $7 a plate a couple years ago, but now that the food is more in the $11 range, it just doesn't cut it.I think that in their rush to become a more popular and higher quality restaurant, they didn't actually think about what makes a restaurant successful. The prices were raised much too quickly, and they give out way too many coupons.I miss the old Garam Masala. We checked this place out cause they were offering a $8 off coupon when you order three entrees for take out. Once we got there they started ringing us up and we were surprised to see them add a 18% surcharge! &#160;Apparently when you use a coupon they "have to" add a mandatory gratuity which is complete crap. Their "coupons" are a total scam!The food was so so and all of the "meat" dishes were so scarce on meat you'd think they were vegetarian. Never going back here. I think this is a pretty underrated Indian restaurant. It's a little grimy, but the service is excellent. Friendly staff that seems family oriented. Sometimes you can see their little girl running around.I really love the butter chicken!!!!! It's my favorite dish here. There are a ton of naans to choose from. They're smaller than Cedar's, but still tasty. They give you a ton of rice. They also sometimes give you a complimentary appetizer or dessert. One time I got rice pudding. Then the last time I went, I got this dessert that was kind of like a beignet, but saturated in some sweet sugar.There are always deals on this place, like buy one get one free entree in the survival kit or on http://restaurant.com for cheap gift certificates. The reviews seem negative for delivery, which I have never done.I recommend this place especially if you want cheaper Indian food If you're thinking about using a coupon here, it's not worth it. I decided to use their $8 off of 3 take out entrees and I seemed to get ripped off. It was lunch and I ordered 3 lunch specials and when I gave them the coupon, the price ended up being $36, Last time I checked, $6.95 x 3 - $8 is $12.85.He then said that I can't use the coupon on lunch specials so he had to charge me with dinner prices. I asked him to just throw the coupon away and I would just pay for the regular lunch special prices without the coupon (which would make my total about $20)He then started rambling on and after 5 minutes of frustration and a hungry family, I just paid the $36 and quickly left.When I made the order on the phone, I asked if he could write which entree was which on each box because I have family that's allergic to certain ingredients so we needed to know which one it was, but when I opened the bag, of course there was nothing telling me which was which.And to top it off, they forgot to give me any plastic spoons or folks and I was at a place where I didn't have access to any silverware.I will most likely not go back here, and would definitely not recommend this place to anyone. My boyfriend had found three hairs in his food between two servings and again a week before...my boyfriend let the owner know what happened. The owner immediately brought up the cleanliness of the kitchen and said everybody in the kitchen was wearing gloves and hairnets (not true). My boyfriend then asked for a discount. The owner started to get flustered and made it sound like if it was our fault and accused us of not &#160;having money and &#160;trying to scam free food. He called the police on us and told them that my boyfriend was pulling out &#160;beard hair and putting it in the food. We were in utter disbelief!! He took our photo and began YELLING at us that this is his 'bread and butter' and 'we're doing this wrong'. &#160;I was speechless! A woman, maybe his wife, came between the owner, my boyfriend and me and pushed him back into the kitchen-- this guy was literally yelling...she very quietly told us 'it's ok you can go'.It was unreal that he reacted like this with other people in the restaurant.Overall the food was average, &#160;the place was a little grimy. Before the owner flipped out, he was very nice, which made this incident so bizarre and infuriating. . My first (AND LAST) time there.king county inspection of Garam Masala in 2010:http://info.kingcounty.g&#8230; Yummy!! &#160; &#160;Stopped at Buffalo Exchange for a browse, went banking, and a couple other shops. &#160;We wanted something to eat for munch. &#160;The choices on the Ave are abundant,...wanna crepe? &#160;hot dog? burger? bagel? and much much more...look across the street and lo &amp; behold...Indian food and a buffet at that!! Ok, decision made, we crossed, walked into this gritty hole in the wall, but were welcomed in with great service and had a great bite to eat!! We were served chai, with our meal and which I loved!! and I am not a fan of chai and mango lassi's!! &#160;yummy! &#160;Will go back with or with out you to have more butter chicken!! and akora and rice pudding!!
If you can look beyond paper plates and plastic utensils, you'll enjoy Garam Marsala. It's inexpensive yet tasty Indian-Pakistani food with just the right portion to leave room for dessert elsewhere.WHY GO THERE? Recession or not, cheap is the new black. But even the budget conscious has good reasons to go out, enjoy the rich offering of local restaurants without going the fast food route. Garam Marsala is one of the reasons to eat out when in The Ave. WHATCHA GOT? From tandoori to vegetarian to curry specials, the list is long. The garlic basil naan is bar none a great bread, seasoned and toasted perfectly in tandoori oven. The naan is huge. Holy Sex in the City! It's the size of Sarah Jessica Parker's face! (Check out the pic). The seekh kebab, lamb mango curry and eggplant bhartha are spiced well and complement the saffron rice and naan. The kebab is on the dry side. I dipped mine in the curry sauce.YOU GOT SERVED. The waiter/cashier is friendly. He took the time to answer our questions. He described how the weekend special, chicken dum biryani, is made we end up having a to-go. "Jai Ho!" we left The Ave satisfied. "Jai Ho!" Yumm-ee! I was a bit weary about the place at first after seeing that they serve all of their dishes in stryofoam even if you dine in, but I've decided that it just makes this place unique. :)Portions here are extremely generous-- My bf and I shared the mango chicken curry with an order of plain naan. The curry had tender pieces of chicken, perfectly spicy and sweet. Sooo good. The naan here is humongous! It is the size of half an arm, not kidding! &#160;The food is really cheap (~$10 for an entree and naan), the wait is about 5 min, flavors are all there and isn't as greasy as most other Indian places. One order for two was perfect! Can't wait to go back! Definitely one of my new favorite places on the Ave for sure! 10 PM rolls by and my roommate and I are feeling the usual laziness that comes before the start of a new quarter. Neither of us want to cook, so we go on Yelp to see what places are still open on a Sunday night. We'd never heard of Garam Masala, but a look at their menu revealed surprising CHEAP entrees for Indian/Pakistani food. Compared to Cedars' $10-$13 per entree, $7 for chicken dishes, $8 for lamb dishes, and $10 for seafood dishes did not seem like a bad deal at all.We needed a minimum of $20 to get delivery, so my roommate and I ordered chicken tikka masala (mild), the lamb vindaloo (hot), garlic and basil naan, and plain naan. The order was placed at 10:30 PM, and the delivery guy arrived around 10:50 PM, so we were very impressed. He was a very nice guy and very patient as I tried to pay him with cash before he reminded me that I'd already paid with a card...whoops.Everything in the delivery came neatly in its own container - two boxes of basmati rice, two "soup containers" of our entrees in their sauces, and two aluminum foil-wrapped loaves of naan. Everything was HUGE. My entree, the lamb vindaloo, wasn't really that hot, but the meat was tender and I just couldn't stop eating! I do wish there had been a few more pieces of meat, though. There were several big chunks and then several smaller, bite-sized pieces, so I'd say about 2/3 of the container was sauce. I got full after eating half the box of rice, half the meat/sauce, and half of the garlic and basil naan. Did I mention that the naan is probably over a foot in diameter if you open it up?If you're craving Indian food, I really suggest Garam Masala. Portions are generous and will probably last you at least two meals. Plus, the food comes quickly, and prices are awesome for Indian cuisine. Not to say you should leave Cedars forever, but why should you pay more for food when the quality is only slightly better? If your on the go this place can hit the spot. Your food comes prepared quite quickly. &#160;Portions are excellent. Comes in styrofoam containers.For lunch I would rather hit one of the Indian Buffets for a better deal. ($7.95)1.Bombay Grill, &#160;2.Tandoor, and a 3. Jewel of India are all in walking distance.When the craving for curry over basmati rice &#160;hits you at 10:30 at night . You call in your order, run in and then run out.For late night dining on the Ave it's a great addition. Please visit Garam Masala, it is amazing food for much less money than other Indian food establishments in the area. I could sustain myself on their paneer masala for the rest of my life. Admittedly I have no idea what authentic Indian food is like, all I can say is that the food here is GOOD. And the employees are so kind. Once the woman at the counter gave me a cup of tea as I waited.I hesitate to give 5 stars because dining here is a bit like eating in a cafeteria, complete with trays, plastic utensils, and styrofoam containers (although last time they seemed to comply with Seattle standards of paper containers, at least for the rice). Therefore get it to go. Soooo, 5 stars if you get it to go, 4 stars if you eat in. The portions are obscene and the naan is some of the best I've had in Seattle. &#160;With some pushing for "extra hot", they seemed willing to make the food fairly hot (for Seattle.) &#160;Not remarkably-so, but enjoyably. &#160;The Indian-Chinese dishes, particularly the x Manchurian and the Chilly Paneer were good, if a bit muddled by too much salt -- the chef is from Delhi and seems comfortable with Indian-Chinese, but it really tasted like too much shoyu had been used. &#160;In any event, I look forward to my next excuse to drop in for too much food, great naan and Indian-Chinese favorites for cheap.Their papdi chaat merits special attention. &#160;It, too, was kind of muddled, but it was just fantastic despite that. &#160;The flavors and textures were just right, and ordered extra hot it came out truly hot. &#160;As is often the case, getting cold dishes made properly hot turns out to be much easier. &#160;Basically fantastic. It's been a while since I've had Indian food so my friend and I decided to check out Garam Masala. She picked it because it was easy to get to and it suited our price range: cheap. LOLThe place is quite small and lacking on decorations, and I should mention NOT to use the washroom. It's like actually being in India (toilets don't flush and you're not supposed to put toilet paper in the toilet) Yikes! It took us forever to order because of the large menu and the fact that I had to ask what items were because I'm not that familiar with all the names. Once we decided, you could choose how hot or mild you wanted each dish. Medium is very hot so unless you want your lips to be on fire, don't choose hot.I odered a coconut chicken curry that was really good but I should have ordered it milder. I also had a chicken tika that was very tasty but a bit dry. It came on this cool hot plate thing and was all sizzling &amp; steaming. My friend odered a bunch of stuff: some kind of okra dish, hot &amp; spicy spinach soupy stuff, a really hot red curry. She said everything was fantastic although some were too hot in taste. we both ordered some naan bread. Mine was just regular kind but was HUGE. Hers was stuffed with some spices and cheese and tasted better than mine. &#160;All our dishes came with a big plate of seasoned rice. Th food here was fantastic and good size portions, too.Overall, this place provides great food and great prices. I would totally go to Garam Masala again. Who can resist tasty, relatively good priced curry that can be delivered?! Definitely not us last night. It took exactly 30 minutes for our glorious order to arrive at our door. I got the Lamb Palak. It may look like something a baby just threw up, but it is very good. Instead of just getting 1 order of Garlic Naan, which was more than enough, we got the Spinach and Cheese Naan as well. We weren't impressed with the stuffed Naan. It didn't have nearly as much flavor as we were expecting, hardly any flavor really. To top off the whole meal, we got free dessert! The Gulab Jamun were like 2 &#160;little doughnut holes with a fantastically sweet sauce and coconut flakes poured over them. Everytime I've gone here it was very good! I'm vegetarian. The food is always moist (not over-cooked) and fresh. And they got their spicy level down, as in you can request medium hot or medium and they get it right!YUM! I like this place for what it is: quick, relatively lower priced Indian food. The rice could be better. But, hey, they have overhead costs to deal with. The Lamb Okra was quite tasty. The Garlic Naan was great. The lay out and decor could be better, though.Update: 3-15-2012They fixed up the place nicely. I had the buffet. The tandoor chicken was very very tasty. Small selection but excellent tastes! Rice was standard for a buffet. I will be back. Curry dishes: 3 out of 5 starsService: 2 out of 5 starsAmbiance: 2 out of 5 starsDining in, they serve you with plastic forks and paper platesYes, they are cheaper then others, but even at Westlake Center, you can get real dishes and metal forks. The portions are small, which makes for the lower pricesNot a fan, came here from their ad in the Seattle Weekly, and the guy seemed annoyed that we had a coupon -Don't you want a R.O.I from your advertising dollars?Great place to get take outI'd say if I was a broke college student, I'd be here every so often, but I won't be going out of my way to come back. Sorry. Ummm no. I have no idea how this place is so highly rated. Upon glancing at the reviews I suspect that it's because most of the reviewers are not Indian. Not that that's a bad thing, it's just demographics!We had the chickent tikka masala as well as the mattar paneer, and when they came out, it was the exact same dish, except one had paneer in it, and the other chicken. It was clear that the sauce was premade and then the stuff was just tossed in right before serving. On top of that, both dishes were all gravy and very little chicken or paneer.In no way should the two be the same! I was looking for home cooked, non-heavy, non-greasy Indian food. Instead, what we got was stereotypical cream laden food. Maybe the other dishes aren't like this, but from what I could tell by looking around, I'm not so sure.There were other Indian people in the restaurant, and perhaps we should have tried what they were ordering - the Tandoori Chicken seemed to be quite popular. To end on a positive note, the naan was pretty excellent - I had the garlic naan and it was thinner and lighter than most naans, and really yummy. The good:- Significantly cheaper than other Indian restaurants for equivalent food. For example, you can get a vegetarian entree with basmati rice of good size for $5.95 vs. most other Indian restaurants in the area which charge $6.95-8.95 for a similar entree plus another $1-2 for rice.- Open until 11pm, &#160;they deliver (until 10:30pm I think?), and you can order delivery online.The bad:They use styrofoam cups and containers, even if you eat in the restaurant. I blame my father who's an environmental engineer... but I just can't be cool with such environmentally destructive things. I'm an unemployed student who needs to save money but it's just not okay. This place gets 4 stars for two reasons: it is cheaper and open later than every other Indian restaurant I've been to in Seattle. &#160;The food is better than everything I've yet had in Capitol Hill, but not as good as Taste of India or Cedar's. &#160;Also, the disposable/styrofoam everything is off-putting. &#160;But again, for the price and convenience, it's a pretty great place to go. Let me start off by saying that I had high expectations for the place and they completely blew it on my first time there.I ordered a plate of Butter Chicken to go and waited for about 8 minutes (nobody else was there). One plastic bag, two Chinese style take out paper holders, one pair of plastic silverware and I was good to go. After arriving at my destination I opened up the bag to smell a delicious aroma of flavors coming out from the butter chicken container. After reaching in and grabbing by first bite of however, it all quickly went down hill. The chicken was burnt on the outside and dry on the inside. And to add insult to injury, there were only 4 pieces of chicken (I'm talking about nibbles here). The only redeeming quality of the butter chicken was the delicious butter chicken sauce it came with.The rice was clearly microwaved as it was very soggy from butter. I'm not talking about moist or wet, I'm talking soggy people.Overall I wasn't impressed at all on my first visit. They received two stars because of price, butter chicken sauce, speed of food.Perhaps they will redeem themselves on the second go around? Perhaps they treat take-out differently from those who eat in the restaurant. We tried this place with friends and the food was really quite good. &#160;The portions are a bit smaller than other Indian restaurants in the area, which explains the slightly smaller price tag, but there's still plenty of food on your plate (just maybe not leftovers). &#160;The place is lacking in atmosphere - food is served on paper plates, and it feels somewhat like a fast food restaurant inside, so perhaps it's better for takeout. &#160;Everyone cleaned their plates and enjoyed themselves. &#160;And, I'd definitely go or order from here in the future. Yum. Very tasty, quick and the staff is super pleasant. Dish Delish!
Great food, great atmosphere, great view of the water. Highly advise on getting the meatloaf, fish n chips is good. Breakfast is yummy. Good service, Family Friendly, and cool location. Love Paddys! This place was barely A-OK. &#160;It's a big tourist trap, situated on the water and next door the Victoria Clipper terminal. &#160;We had lunch, which was average at best: &#160;an over-priced steak sandwich and an over-priced reuben sandwich. &#160;Nothing special, nothing horrible either. &#160;In other words, pretty blah. My husband and I walked down to Paddy Coyne's for dinner recently. We got seated and there were two other tables of diners in the place that we could see - one table inside and one outside - yet no one spoke to us or brought us water for at least 10 minutes. &#160;We literally waved a waitress down and she acted surprised about it, which was confusing because one of the other sets of diners was sitting RIGHT next to us and she helped them, so there's no way she didn't see us. There was a waiter standing next to the bar the whole time and he wasn't doing anything (besides watching TV and talking to the bartender), so it's unclear why he ignored us also. Once the waitress came over, the service was ok from her, but bad service is SO frustrating, especially when HARDLY ANYONE ELSE IS THERE. &#160;Clearly they saw us. &#160;And chose to ignore us. &#160;Why?! &#160;The food wasn't anything special. &#160;I had a salad with chicken and my husband had the colcannon, which is a bunch of stuff mixed together with mashed potatoes. &#160;It looked unfortunate but tasted ok. &#160;Turns out something must have been wrong with my salad, because I spent the night barfing it up. &#160;Gross, I know...trust me.
Absolutely loved this place. &#160;During a four day stay in Seattle, I came here three times. &#160;First time I was there, I just had a drip coffee, and fell in love with the atmosphere there. &#160;The cute artwork on the wall + Mismatched furniture + Fantastic customer service + unpretentious atmosphere + good food = LOVE.So, when we were trying to come up with lunch options, I immediately suggested the Ugly Mug. &#160;And, that's when I learned the food was just as good as the coffee (ok, fine it's a little better). &#160;My group ordered: &#160;two tomato/pumpkin soups (divine), a bulgogi sandwich (perfectly seasoned, but could use more meat), and a Gobbler sandwich (thanksgiving, yum!).And, then, on my last day, when I was trying to think of what would be the perfect Seattle meal to end my trip with--I came back to the Ugly Mug and got the Tuscan Bread soup (my favorite!!) and half of the California BLT (the bread it was on was SO GOOD). If I decide to matriculate at the UW, I would come here all the time. There are so many wonderful things about this cafe. It was my home away from home Freshman year. Everything here is delicious, you can't go wrong! And the service is incredible! (Thank you David and Nara!) It's the Decor that's the best though, it reminds me of my Grandma's! Furthermore, the owner paints the coolest dog paintings. I want to buy one! Here are some highlights:1. Pumpkin Tomato Soup: creamy, delicious, and with PUMPKIN!2. Lavender Chai... so warm and calming on a cold and stressful day!3. Apple Cinnamon &#160;bread- sweet sweet sweet!4. Delicious and reasonably priced Cafe'D'Arte coffee.5. fluffy yet buttery foccacia, also available for sale by the loaf for only $1.50.This place is truly a gem among the grunge of U-district. Love.I went here with a friend (we'd tried to go once before but couldn't find it) and I am so glad we did. I had a California BLT, and while I love avocado on BLT, I was a little nervous about the cream cheese. I needn't have worried, it was amazing. Definitely order a half sandwich, it's really a whole sandwich. Unless you want TWO sandwiches.Anyway, I'm thrilled that I'm moving to the U District and go here all the time. I really liked the atmosphere, too. I can see myself doing work there in the future. I love the Ugly Mug, good coffee, good service, wonderful coffee shop atmosphere. The only downside, totally not their fault though is that it is so busy during peak times. So many times, the line is out the door, and we have had to take our coffee to go, because there is no place to sit. However, I kind of see that as a good thing. The girls who work there are always so helpful and accommodating, love you guys! And I love going at non-peak hours, snagging a table and doing some reading. I had first heard about Ugly Mug from an OKCupid date. The date in general wasn't the best, but the fact that I learned about this place was worth it.It can be a little hard to spot if you're coming down 43rd from University Way, as a sign for parking blocks its sign. Just keep going! You'll find it! Once you get in the door, it's a really cute little cafe with a welcoming vibe. There are a good number of tables, plus a couch-- I've generally not had issues getting a seat, though while waiting for something to-go I often feel in the way.Their chai is excellent, and my favorite sandwich is the California BLT. The sandwich sizing is a little weird, in that a "whole" sandwich (at least for the CBLT) is actually two sandwiches, and the "half" is just a one sandwich. I generally find that a "half" is enough for me, but you might want to ask them to tell you what you're going to get. I might actually go get a sandwich now! After reading reviews here, I definitely had to try out the Ugly Mug. &#160;Easy (but paid) parking on a Saturday morning, wonderful ambience, delightful staff. &#160;The decor was similar to a French cafe - and to my delight, the food was too! &#160;I tried out the Ovaltine Latte after a reviewer recommended it - definitely awesome. &#160;Only reason for a 4/5 here is that what we ordered didn't exactly match the description on the board, so it was a little confusing. &#160;But still delicious. &#160;I will be back! Their whole sandwich is actually two sandwiches! Not a problem since the turkey sandwich I ordered was DELICIOUS! I will definitely be back again and again. Can't wait to try their other sandwiches - this time I'll order a half and try one of their soups. Can't wait to go back. nice, cozy coffee shop Delicious sandwiches. I have a thing for sandwiches, I think they might be my favorite food in the whole world. So the fact that ugly mug has a variety of healthy, large and delicious sandwiches pretty much makes my day. I get the turkey gobbler (turkey, cream cheese and cranberry sauce). The staff are also friendly and efficient. Best drip coffee I've had in Seattle. The turn off was there were coffee grounds floating in it, but it was good enough that I didn't care. I ordered a special with the roasted vegetable focaccia sandwich and upgraded to a bowl of vegetable and bread soup. The soup was very nice, perfect for a rainy day. The focaccia for the sandwich was top notch--if only it had been toasted. Also, the roasted pepper was quite bland; both it and the swiss cheese were no match for the focaccia. With a little tweaking, this sandwich could knock your socks off. I stayed a while looking over some texts, so I ordered a refill along with a slice of pumpkin bread. The bread is better than average, but next time I'll try a cookie.The staff are very friendly, service is prompt. My special was brought to my table in a short time. The seating is a bit cramped, but the cafe has a warm feel. The turnover is high, with a lot of people coming and going so it's not so good to get work done if you need to concentrate, but it's a great place to catch up with a friend over (really good) coffee. I will definitely be back soon. I love this place and wished I had discover it when I was going to UW.Both my friend and I ordered the smoked turkey sandwich and pumpkin tomato soup. I can't remember the last time I had such fresh and tasty sandwich. The soup was creamy with just the right temperature I might add. Their coffee was perfectly made. &#160;My friend ordered the Mexican mocha which was rich and creamy. It is a must try item on the menu.The interior is a bit small but the cozy and homey decor makes up for it. Service was nice and friendly. If you're around the U-district area, you definitely need to visit this place. this place gave me blt cravings for weeks when i went back to cali!!tried to make it just like them with the cream cheese, but not quite.....came back for the 2nd time while in seattle and this place did not disappoint! sweet service. quaint cafe, perfect for reading or studying....blt and iced mint tea. my faves. Great sandwiches.Can be crowded and a little slow during lunchtime, but the fresh ingredients are worth the wait.They accept take out orders over the phone and always have food ready to go when I arrive. Ugly mug is a cute little place to grab a lunch or snack with a co-worker, and is a reliable to-go option for sandwiches and soups if you're on the run or need something quick to eat at your desk. &#160;The food isn't terribly exciting, but it's actually quite difficult to get a reliable soup/salad combo in the U District, so Ugly Mug fits the bill. &#160;I quite enjoy their lental curry soup on a rainy day. &#160;I've also tried the tuscan bread soup and found it to be quite strong on the black pepper. &#160;Beware the sandwiches are truly ginormous - opt for a half sandwich unless you are very hungry! Great place to grab an americano and chat with a friend or study on a rainy day (well, any day!). Laid back, comfortable cafe with great food and friendly service. Sandwiches are fresh and well priced. I especially like the turkey &amp; cranberry. And, of course, not to be missed is the most talked about menu item, the bulgogi sub. It didn't leave me with heartburn like a lot of other marinated meats do and the honey-mustard-esque sauce its coupled with makes for a darn tasty combo. Exquisite, my favorite coffee shop in Seattle. Good service, good drinks &amp;food, best atmosphere around. Small and hygge, I love coming here.The staff is helpful and laidback, very friendly, and appreciative of their business. I enjoy every opportunity I have to come here. Nice and friendly staff.Bulgogi sandwich was tasty.Gotta try the BLT next. I love Ugly Mug. &#160;Considering the million other awful too busy, too loud cafes on the Ave (hmm...Cafe on the Ave maybe?) this place is an absolute gem. &#160;I'll start with the staff...they are always SO genuinely friendly and kind. &#160;They smile and ask how you are and let you take your time and I feel like they really care. &#160;Other bonuses: homemade chais, tuscan bread soup, internet that WORKS. &#160;It's intimate and cozy in a way that never feels too crowded. &#160;It's affordable. &#160;Really there is nothing bad I can say about the Ugly Mug. &#160;It is a pleasant oasis and I look forward to holing myself up there for ten hour finals study sessions many more times. Warning: Sandwiches are way too good. Um you had me at Turkey and rosemary mayo. I definitely have had cravings to go back and get more.The other day I ordered pumpkin bread with my sandwich and the sweet girl behind the counter gave me banana bread.Oh sweet sweet surprises of deliciousness. I didn't even care after I had a bite Another reason I miss being in school and having an excuse to hang out in the U-district. Coffee and sandwiches here were a very fond part of my grad school experience.Their sandwiches are huge ... only get a 1/2. Delicious hearty bread. I also dig their bulgogi. I am new to Seattle and have been looking for good coffeeshops. The Ugly Mug Cafe is a place that I like to go. It has really good tea, i'm not a coffee drinker so I usually get the Early Grey or English Breakfast Tea. The internet is free and pretty fast. The ambiance is nice, homey. It's a little bit dim but there are cute accents to the tables and walls. The people who work there are friendly and nice. The only things I don't love are 1) they aren't open on Sundays (which is weird for a coffeeshop) and 2) sometimes their music is a bit too soap opera-y. Like my boyfriend once said when we were in there "I feel like i'm on the set of Dawson's Creek". Other than that, it's a great place to go. I definitely recommend it if you want to stop in for a drink or need a place to cruise the internet for a while with your laptop. Love this place. I've only been a few times but am always very impressed with the service. The ladies behind the counter are always there to greet you as you walk in. My roommate has me hooked on their Ovaltine Latte's. Delicious. Food is great too, quite affordable! So close to UW campus, great place to swing by for a quick lunch or coffee. I love that there are chairs and sofas in the cafe as well. Very comfortable working environment, definitely a recommended place to study. cozy cozy cozy!very friendly staff, and delicous food.  The sandwhiches are chock full of veggies and flavorful with rosemary mayo or cranberry sauce etc., for only around $5. &#160;the soup is homemade, the croissants and bagels and soft and to die for. &#160; The breakfast sandwhich is a little wierd, the egg comes separate with jam and bread and a salad. &#160;But i have come to like it that way. A B S O L U T E L Y &#160;loved this place!!!!!! i'm from california, and i've been craving their blt since the day i had one. &#160;it's something about their bread, and the cream cheese that makes it like no other blt i've tried!!! i am in love with this place, and this is after a $39 parking ticket i got for not paying for street parking~!! i would definitely go bacK~!! The Ugly Mug is the perfect little cafe! It is a quaint, cozy shop where you can get warm, full, and comfy. I usually order a bowl of pumpkin tomato soup and a poppy seed muffin (which is usually too much after I have eaten all that soup, so I take it with me for a tasty snack!). The strange thing is that I really don't like the taste of pumpkin and I don't really like tomato soup either, but for some reason I like their soup. It's creamy, tangy, and delicious! My only problem is that tomato soup is really acidic, so I can't eat it too often because it makes me feel sick, but that's my fault, not the soups fault. The soup comes with a couple of slices of crusty bread, which compliments it really nicely. The staff is really nice too. They are always smiling and polite, which is a definite plus in my book. Since, I live and work only a couple of blocks from here I always recommend it to clients that ask me where to eat for lunch, so I hope they are getting plenty of business! =] This is a surprisingly good place to eat a sandwich. The Ugly Mug Cafe is the perfect cafe. It's small, cozy, quirky and has a great selection of food and both coffee and tea (looseleaf) drinks. Their soups are always so hearty and fresh and their sandwiches have incredible flavor (recommended: veggie focaccia)! The staff is friendly and the seating is perfect for sitting with some soft music and reading/work (free Wi-Fi). The Ugly Mug has worse hours than some of the other cafes in the area, but much better atmosphere. &#160;Highly recommended for some daytime downtime. Excellent sandwich and coffee house. If you're into Korean food, try the Bulgogi Sandwich, it's the Ugly Mug's specialty. If you aren't into Korean food, or you like bacon more than you like Korean food, get the California BLT. Cream cheese and avocado on a BLT is pure bliss. Very friendly staff. This is my favorite place to lunch in the u-district. I've literally never met nicer people than the ones who work here. &#160;I'm vegetarian, so I usually go for the veggie ciabatta sandwich and it's always good &amp; filling, and it costs less than $5. Nowhere else is as reliably pleasant, cheap, and delicious as the Ugly Mug. I've never seen it too busy, so food doesn't take very long, and it's got a great location near campus.Also, (of course) there's wifi! This is a cute little cafe, that generally looks like a hole in the wall on the outside, but on the inside the vibe is quite different. I never really noticed this place until my friend told me I had to try the bulgolgi sandwich, and so I tried it and here is my review.It was delicious! And this is coming from a person who doesn't really like sandwiches... I don't really know why, but never really favored it for lunch, or even dinner for that matter.Definitely will come back and try the other stuff on their menu, and being that I am not much of a coffee drinker... I might suck it up and try anyways since all the reviews are raving :) OMG, the sandwiches &amp; the ovaltine latte are just phenomenal! why didn't i discover this place before???? the 2 sandwiches we tried were the bulgogi sub (i asked to replace the bread with whole wheat which they happily obliged with) &amp; the veggie focaccia. love the grungy Seattle ambience...run by a Korean family &amp; friends.will be back very soon! Ugly Mug is a treasure. Incredibly friendly people, delicious food, great prices, and wonderful decor. It's especially great for lunch or an early dinner on a rainy or cool day.Everything I've eaten here has been good, but for me the highlights are the soups (particularly the tuscan bread and the pumpkin tomato) &#160;and sandwiches (the California BLT - BLT + avocado + cream cheese - and the bulgolgi sub are both fantastic). The 1/2 sandwich is enough, though I am rarely able to resist adding in a cup of soup. And, no, it's not hyperbole when people say &#160;the 1/2 sandwich really is a whole sandwich. I try to sit at a different table each time to enjoy the different notes, etc under the glass. Love this place.
Ok I didn't really try to much of their food, I really only went for the happy hour oysters! Ok so first off I do have to say the guy that helped us to the table (the really tall guy) was a total douche! The oyster were really good for happy hour! 6 bux for a dozen... but only at the bar, not the bar area! The calamari was ok... the tuna poke was ok (very small). &#160;I guess this place is alright. I probably wont be coming back for anything other than oyster!! YAY!! I've been here several times but recently tried their new location at South Lake Union. &#160;I think they've done a pretty cool job with the interior of the restaurant. &#160;Ambience is great as well.I'm not sure why, but every time I've been here I come away not impressed with the food. &#160;Don't get me wrong, its not bad, but its not mind blowing either. &#160;Maybe its' just me . ... Really enjoyed our dinner. &#160;The food was great and the open space is nice. &#160;I had the tuna, which was a real treat, and my freind had scallops. &#160;We both had a great meal. &#160;We will definatley go back. Meh, the salmon was cooked correctly but lacked flavor. Service was ok, but the atmosphere was a bit pretentious. Seastar around the corner is far better in all aspects. I loved Flying Fish! I definitely thought it was a sushi restaurant by the name, but was happily surprised at the variety of food available. I went all crazy and ordered a whole mess of appetizers (from the awesome, awesome happy menu that goes til 7!) and got French Onion soup, ahi ceviche (holy moly this was the tastiest stuff ever..), cauliflower crisps, calamari and some damn good wine. I'll definitely be returning. I went there during a week day and had the restaurant to myself. My server was amazing and the food was excellent.Ive noticed the mixed reviews about this place but i will stick to my positive experience till the day i return. Salt and Pepper Dungeness Crab w/ sesame noodles, carrot daikon salad FTW!!! My husband and I were drowning in the dungeness crab. Definitely a restaurant I wish the Bay Area had but glad that when I come visit Seattle it is there waiting for me. I regret not coming here more often when we were Washingtonians.Great happy hour too!You seriously can't go wrong with any type of seafood dish that you order. It'll come out fresh and delish. Creative seafood. Always strong. Excellent seafood, very good service and fun atmosphere. This is hands down my favorite Seafood restaurant in Seattle. Although I was a bigger fan of their Belltown location - the Flying Fish in South Lake Union is still very charming.I recommend the Calamari to start with. We decided to share the large platter - the muscles and the fish tacos were excellent. Although the muscles were not the best I've ever had.As for entrees - I certainly recommend the Albacore Tuna. This was very tasty!The service is spot and and the ambiance is lively. I would certainly come back! Flying Fish has an excellent happy hour! All small plates are $6 which is practically half off! Wine was $5 a glass and draft beer was $3 and it goes until 7pm! Between the 4 of us, we tried almost every single small plate and had no complaints! The heirloom tomato salad, clams, and calamari were our favorites. On the downside, the menu is a tad small, and I can see why this place could get old after a few visits. I had one of the best meals here back in 2007. &#160;The rockfish in Thai curry may be one of the best preparations of all things fish I have had in the U.S.A. &#160;The perfect Asian Fushion: it still lights up my memory. If spicy is not your thang, than the species offered here are always fresh and tasty in more simple styles, especially the Alaskan or local salmon, the Dungeness crab, the rockfish, or the diver scallops. &#160;Stay in this part of the menu and you will always be rewarded. Last night was my first visit to the new location (have gone previously in Belltown), and the new space is very open, un-finished (exposed pipes), and roomy. It has a more casual feel than previously. Unique cocktails, decent wine list, and the food was all good (but not mind blowing). We started with the fish tacos which were heavily seasoned and generously portioned. My scallops came perfectly cooked. For dessert I had the apple pie ala mode (nutmeg ice cream) - the pie was delicious, but the nutmeg was too delicately flavoured to pick out. Service was good. I enjoyed my meal here and recommend Flying Fish for a casual Monday dinner spot since so many other places are closed, it wouldn't be my first pick though. Have been here a few times already, and with the limited food option in the westlake area will probably coming back a few more times. &#160;I have had the fish tacos, scallop rissoto and the burger. The scallop rissoto is thus far the best out of the 3 I have ate. However, if you are hungry and light on budget I would recommend the burger. I didn't think it was anything special, but at least I dont have to wait in line compare to Blue Moon.The taco was alright and I wasnt really a fan of it.Not sure what else to say, but nothing really in this area so you take what you get. The salt and pepper Dungeness crab platter is my favorite meal in Seattle! The other food that I've had here is fine, not particularly great, but the crab is so good that I've come back for it at least half a dozen times. Two pounds of crab (the smallest unit you can get) is a light meal for 2, to be supplemented with a few small plates or one large (or just get more crab!). &#160;Pretty extensive wine list, with a decent selection by the glass. &#160;They'd put up some acoustic material on the ceiling since my previous visit, which helped with the noise level, but it's still by no means a quiet, romantic spot. I've now been twice to the new location for lunch, I might try happy hour but I'm done with lunch. Lunch 1 - Large platter fish tacos. Fish overcooked, not nearly the 9oz. the server said it would be, guacamole &amp; salsa were mediocre. Just plain boring for $22.Lunch 2 - Generous serving of well cooked ling cod. Menu says the fish is accompanied by English peas and potatoes. Technically that's true but it's about a tablespoon of peas and maybe one small red potato. The thyme butter sauce was incredibly bland &amp; boring.Atmosphere is ok, very noisy though.Service was pretty slow, especially for lunch. Just not a good value for the money. Had lunch at Flying Fish and was quite happy with the food. I had the Kobe Beef Burger. It definitely is one of the better burgers I have had till date. Their menu is small but the quality is pretty good. I would go back to try the other dishes.Overall: Recommended My team ventured to this restaurant for a quick happy hour last night. We were impressed with the quality of the beer selection as well as the kind staff. The building reminded me of the inside of Amazon with its funky ceiling. Overall the appetizers were good and we had enough space for a large group. Hands down the best scallops I've ever had. Now that we have that out of the way Flying Fish had a great vibe and the colors were ***staring all around the room***.... purdy :)They had a good wine list and all of my co-workers were pleasantly surprised with the high quality of service, attention to detail, and the customer service.Happy hour to boot? Girl gimme that. much better ventilation at this new location,fish meals are superb but small portion, dessert too, please reserve, sign up for email promos Popped in last November with two girlfriends on a Saturday night and we were seated immediately. We shared the clams, salmon cake, the fish tacos and finished with the creme brulee. All were delicious and cooked to perfection with the exception of the salmon cake which was fine but not memorable. The portions were perfect for us but definitely not large by any means, no one left the table hungry. I agree with Lily S. Flying Fish is okay. Loved the staff and service, but the food left something to be desired. Some of our dishes were definitely bland. I guess for $20+ entrees, I really want to be wowed. The bar is great. The ambiance is more modern, urban chic. &#160;Very roomy and air conditioned. &#160;The seafood is very fresh and tasty. They like to mix in salsas and spices. &#160;I had the whole fried rockfish. &#160;The fish was a little overcooked but had a good flavor. &#160;I wasnt crazy about the rice paper tortillas. &#160;They are kind of slimy. &#160;I'd rather have corn tortilla. &#160;My wife had the fish tacos and I tried one. They were great. &#160;I would recommend this place for a nice night out with friends or that special person. I never went to the old location, but I can say I don't like the new one. I never felt comfortable in the restaurant. The space is awful and poorly decorated. Whoever decorated this place could not decide on what theme to go with so they put in a hodgepodge of things. The bar is brightly lit that looks like it came from IKEA. The rest of the place looks like they were trying to to do a combo of a low lit romantic restaurant and a new contemporary design. The food... ugh. I have heard numerous reviews from friends about how it is an amazing seafood restaurant. It reminds me of just you average seafood place. Nothing was really bad, but there was not amazing stand out. I had a crab cake that was overworked and stringy. The sauce and citrus salad that came with were good. The Big Eye sashimi had a a lot of connective tissue which was like trying to chew a rubber band. Again, the sauce and blood orange accompaniments were good. I would have ordered more, but I was pretty disappointed so I stopped. My wife's celery root soup was great. It was not too rich and had a nice fresh flavor. Her pasta was a disappointment. The smoked salmon, while it had a nice balance of sweet and smokey, the bigger pieces were extremely salty. The pasta was cooked well. The lemon-basil pesto was congealed and very heavy on the cream. I saw some of the bigger plates come out, like the crab, that looked promising; unfortunately I was not in the mood to try more food. Our service was fine, not the best or worst. Not the premiere seafood place I was hoping for, especially for the price. You know when you have a friend in from out of town, and they want to go to dinner, and they have no specific criteria other than "not too pricy, not too cheap" or "not too noisy, not too quiet"? And of course you want to take them to a place that does not exist where they live, and has good drinks, and doesn't rush you out, or squeeze you into a small space... the list is endless.Flying FIsh is your go-to place for this scenario. The food is good, service is attentive but not in-your-face, the menu has numerous options and the space is open and comfortable. And fish galore... which is exactly what people want to eat when they come to the Pacific NW! A friend and I decided to check out Flying Fish for happy hour (4pm-7pm). &#160;It was a nice day so we sat on the patio. &#160;The server was pleasant, but didn't give any recommendations or care to explain the menu a bit.The prices for happy hour were ok. &#160;Draft beers were only $3 which was great. &#160;But, the prices for the small plates could have been better. &#160;All small plates are $6. &#160;For some of the offerings that is a great deal. But $6 for a garden salad? No way. &#160;I would suggest they should have 1/2 off small plates. Bread was $2.50 which I thought was lame. &#160;I like places with complimentary bread :)The food was good, but nothing to write home about. I'd heard good things about Flying Fish, so I decided to give it a try with a few friends of mine.The food wasn't bad by any means, but it was a little disappointing. The rockfish was more trouble than it was worth, to the point that my net enjoyment of it was actually negative. They had an opah on the menu, so I tried it, and although the oil it was cooked in had some flavor to it, the fish itself was dry and bland. The apple pie I had dessert was prolly the best part of the meal, but then again I have a sweet tooth, so...The worst part of it was the service. The service was just excruciatingly slow. We expected to be at the restaurant for only an hour or so, hour and a half at the most. But the meal dragged on to well over 2 hours. We prolly spent more time waiting for our food to arrive than we spent actually eating. Now I know a lot of high-end restaurants will take their time preparing the dishes and everything, but at least those other restaurants don't make you feel like you're waiting for something to happen.That combined with other small things, like when the bread came out, the butter was cold and hard to spread, or how our water glasses were empty more often than not. It just felt like our server just wasn't doing their job.Disappointing food. Service that makes the TSA look friendly and attentive by comparison. Overall a bad dining experience. With so many seafood options in Seattle, I'll prolly never come back to Flying Fish ever again. I haven't been so Flying Fish in over 10 years. &#160;Going last night with a friend I could not remember what I ate 10 years ago and whether it was good or not. &#160;The service was more than adequate and we had a nicely paced meal. &#160;I started with a treviso and blue cheese salad that had a very nice balance of textures and flavors. &#160;The blue cheese was on the mild side so as not to overpower the other flavors. &#160;For my main, I wanted to have the black cod, however, our server updated us that they had actually meant to say "ling" instead of "black." &#160; Instead, I opted for the sea bream with a fig sauce which actually were just roasted mission figs. &#160;I couldn't tell if they were fresh or dried and reconstituted. &#160;I only wish the crust on my fish had been a bit crunchier, it seemed like by the time I received my dish it was a bit soggy. &#160;For dessert, we ordered the pumpkin donuts with caramel and chocolate sauce and salted caramel pot de creme. &#160;Both were delicious, especially the salted caramel pot de creme; it had the perfect balance of sweet/salty. &#160;We had a Groupon so for what we paid the restaurant had excellent value. &#160;Without the Groupon I would definitely say that this meal was a bit overpriced. It's never fun to be underwhelmed by a restaurant but Flying Fish falls into this category with a loud *thud*.Went for happy hour, which I've been told is "amazing" but wasn't able to find a seat in the bar. So, decided to stay for dinner and order a bunch of apps. I will give them this, the calamari was very good. But like any subpar restaurant experience, there is a tradeoff. The ahi tuna on flatbread appetizer was more or less an abomination. They took a beautiful piece of tuna and ruined it by drenching it in kalamata olives and oddly tasting peppers. It was very discouraging. I really don't see myself giving Flying Fish another try. I don't see the point. The menu is pretty boring and Serious Pie is a short distance away. Why settle for mediocrity? The new locations is a great location for business lunches and casual dining. I had lunch today with the ladies and it was pretty happening in there. Excellent service, good food, spacious dining room, modern and clean decor. Not that I care much about decor. If the food is good, then I'd eat it in a rundown shack with no electricity.Anyway, it was a pleasant experience. I found street parking right in front of the restaurant (Wow!) and walked to Whole Foods to get some strawberry jam afterwards...ok, sorry, this review is turning into my diary.I hear they have happy hour. I will return soon... I had a nice Saturday night meal here. Tried a few fish entrees (thinking it would be their specialty since the restaurant name has fish in it) and they were both fine... However, except for the pumpkin donut dots for dessert (which were very good - I recommend), I didn't taste anything that made me want to go back and try more... Maybe we didn't order quite right?Overall, enjoyed my meal... it's worth trying once, but for the price and lack of something amazing to tempt me, I probably won't be going back. My Dad and I ate here on my first day back home for the holidays and it was an amazing meal. &#160;I had a groupon so that helped out on the bill. &#160;Our waiter was great he was very prompt and also assisted me in my selection as I was stuck between two options. &#160;I went with the swordfish he swayed me to and it was AMAZING. &#160;My dad ordered the salmon which he really enjoyed but he had wished he ordered the swordfish as well. &#160;After our meal we shared a order of the pumpkin dippin donuts and they were a nice way to cap off the meal. &#160;The restaurant was very nice inside and perfect for a date night or just a dinner with friends. &#160;They have a great wine selection and their menu changes daily so you can always see new options when you go. I can't believe I never reviewed Flying Fish when it was still located on First Avenue in Belltown. &#160;I dined there so many times over the years and had such phenomenal meals, cocktails, and service that I must have assumed I reviewed it. &#160;Flying Fish was like an old friend.Well, my old friend got a new 'do, and it looks great on her! &#160;Hooray for more choices in South Lake Union! &#160;My lunch there this week was fantastic, as the sun streamed in through the huge glass windows and the service was impeccable. &#160;My friend ordered the Kobe burger, and I coveted that dish the entire time we were there. &#160;Not that my dish was bad - it was a very tasty Vietnamese pork bowl with rice noodles, bean sprouts, cilantro, and lettuce. &#160;It was reminiscent of my favorite dish at the Noodle Ranch - Mekong Grill - but with pork instead of chicken. &#160;My other friend enjoyed the risotto.I hear the happy hour is good, and a friend of mine lives in SLU, so now we have another option for an after-work drink! Bustling Atmosphere, Seafood was stellar,Prices a bit high.My family and I came here for my mom's birthday. I immediately liked the atmosphere at Flying Fish --- it held a variety of people who were dressed from casual jeans and a sweater to some who came in an evening gown but the crowd was varied enough that anyone could be and dress in whatever they'd like and they would not stand out. The bartender made my mom a great double Ceasar (Bloody Mary but with Clamato juice) as she requested, which was a nice start to the evening. I had the scallop dish, which was delicious. The portions are not huge here, which I like, and all the flavors of every dish blended very well together. The only drawback to Flying Fish is that it will put a dent in your wallet; even with two groupon coupons (=$100), we paid about $180 for the five of us (including one drink each and two appetizers for the table). I went to lunch with a friend recently to Flying Fish's new location. &#160;The place was busy. &#160;We did not have a good experience with service. &#160;It was about 10 minutes until we got any water and we were both thirsty. &#160;However, the food was pretty good. &#160;The calamari at Flying fish is great and we got one to share. &#160;I remember it being much larger at dinner and thought it was a bit small. &#160;I chalked that up to it being the lunch portion but I am unsure. &#160;I was still very happy with the flavor of the aioli. &#160;The salmon I ordered was cooked well but I didn't really like the flavor of the startch accompanying it. &#160;Luckily my friend ordered the risotto and shared with me. &#160;The risotto was pretty good but nothing amazing. &#160;Overall I would say the best thing here is that aoli and calamari dish which makes the whole thing worth it. &#160;I will not be jumping back to Flying Fish soon unless they have that calamari on their happy hour :) A by-the-numbers, color-within-the-lines restaurant...a welcoming modern decor with high ceilings and wall-to-wall windows, pleasant unassuming staff, and food that you come away with thinking, okay, I had a decent meal. In other words, absolutely serviceable, albeit not memorable. Dinner started with an heirloom tomato salad which, while doubtless fresh, lacked a straight-from-the-garden piquancy. (Then again, maybe it hasn't been a good tomato season). The oysters excelled, but the Alaskan salmon swam in the "okay, not great" category. Peach cobbler with lemon-ginger ice cream proved a highlight. After a day of sight-seeing we went looking for a restaurant at 4pm. &#160;We had a few requirements: 1. Happy Hour 2. Really good food 3. Will let us bring in kids. &#160;We headed to the Re:Public - the reviews were great on Yelp, but the happy hour menu was very limited, and they sent us down the street to Flying Fish, which did not disappoint!The Hostess sat us near the bar, but not in it since we had kids with us.All small plates were $6 during happy hour, there where were a few things that were $4 and some discounted drinks. Our kids have eclectic plates for children and enjoyed most of the food. &#160;All the food was fresh and the flavors were wonderful. &#160;Below is a list of what we tried.Crispy Calamari &#160;- Excellent, honey jalapeno mayonnaise rocks and is not very spicy at all.Ahi Poke - we had to order two, my daughter loved it! If you like sashimi this is a dish for you!Thai Crab Cake - They were very good, but too spicy for kids.Green bean salad - amazing flavorsFried Oyster Caesar Salad &#160;- excellentField Greens Salad - really really great salad dressing!Fish tacos - kids loved themJapanese 5 spice French fries ( can;t remember the name - stated with a T) - were excellent - the flavor of the spices and the dip it came with was perfection!I had the Fish out of Water Martini and if you like grapefruit juice and a citrusy not-to-sweet drink, you should try it.We took two desserts to go for later in the evening; the pumpkin dots and the salted caramel pot de creme. &#160;Both were amazing! Flying Fish is settling in at its beautiful new space in South Lake Union. &#160;I dine there often and thought it time to speak up. &#160;What's not to love; high quality food, sexy inviting bar, super easy parking, and no drug addicts or bullets to dodge on your way in! &#160;My all time favorites include Tuna Poke (out of this world), the Salt &amp; Pepper Dungeness Crab (no one does it better), and the Whole Fried Fish (healthier than you might think and tons of fun to share) - all remain top notch dishes. &#160;How about some dessert? &#160;The ice creams are incredible; recently tried two on the menu. &#160;Huckleberry and Chocolate-Caramel - WOW! &#160;Lunch or dinner, there are plenty of choices, surely to please you and your friends. &#160;Oh, and did I mention - the best happy hour in town - and now it's OYSTER Happy Hour season. &#160;Enjoy! I ate here last night with my Fiance and my parents. I am vegan and I never know what to expect when dining at a non-vegetarian restaurant, requesting a vegan dish. We informed FF of my diet when we made the reservation. Our waiter was SO nice and had already spoken to the kitchen to see what they could prepare for me and he was ready with suggestions when we sat down. He said they could prepare some vegetables with an asian flare over rice. Sounded fine to me, and I was happy they could accomodate me. I was expecting the same pile of over cooked veggies on rice smothered in soy sauce that has been my experience at other restaurants. I was so surprised! I got the most beautiful plate of veggies (bok choy, crispy onions, some REALLY delish green thing I didn't recognize, perfectly cooked mushrooms)! They had some sort of crumbly topping on them, and they were beautifully presented and included pomegranate seeds for some color. &#160;I ate everything on the plate. SOOOOO good. One of the best meals i've ever had anywhere vegan or not. Thanks, Flying Fish for such a wonderful experience! Mr. T. and I went to Flying Fish on Saturday to use a Groupon we had purchased. If only we had bought more! Dinner was delicious, though I thought the "large plates" could have used something more to balance them out; the mahi mahi and the salmon were each accompanied by a rather simple preparation of root vegetables, and a third element (maybe something acidic or crunchy) would have given the dishes more depth. The real reason to go to FF is the happy hour: $6 for all "small plates," $5 wine and $3 draft beers (including local microbrews), and some amazing cauliflower fritters for $4. At the bar, they gave us an extra half-dozen of oysters for no apparent reason, and a free order of calamari that must have been a misfire. Maybe this will never happen again, but it speaks to a flexibility and generosity that is matched by the service. I can't wait to go back! I went here for my dad's birthday dinner. It was FANTASTIC! I had the mushroom risotto with sea scallops. It was a huge portion which I was not expecting but the best risotto I have ever had. Also the scallops were so fresh and tasty. The wine guy was fabulous as well. He had a lot of wine knowledge and the wine he picked for us was great. Best thing though was the Grappa brownie which they should probably re-name "heaven" because it was the BEST chocolate cake I have had in a long time. There was some sort of vanilla ganash in the middle of this melt in your mouth cake (they call it a brownie but its more of a cake). There was also this yum yum vanilla ice cream on a bed of chocolate nibs. ugh... best meal of my life. OMG this place is amazing! &#160;I went there on a recent rainy Saturday night with my guy. &#160; This was my first time there, so I can't compare it to what it was like 10 years ago. &#160;The space is beautiful, and chic, lots of &#160;windows and art. &#160;Service was impeccable, a rarity in the Northwest. &#160;I had the King Salmon with celery puree and roasted beets. &#160;The fish was cooked to perfection and complemented the beets and puree. &#160;My Pinot Noir was a great touch to the meal. &#160;My guy had the cod and he loved it. &#160;We both agreed this was one of the best seafood meals we've had in ages. &#160;I am puzzled by some of the poor reviews, this was one of the best experiences we've had in a restaurant in a very long time. &#160;There is a reason why this place has received so much national attention, it truely is one of the Northwest's best places. &#160;I rarely give 5 stars to a place - it has to have it all: &#160;great atmosphere, excellent service, and excellent food. &#160;Flying Fish achieved all of this and more. &#160;Go check it out for yourself. Well I should begin this with my love for the 'old' flying fish location and the food contained within, but something just didn't transfer to the new location.They seemingly were looking for an 'industrial' feel to the new space but in my humble opinion parts of the space just feel unfinished. &#160;It is open, with high ceilings, but I just couldn't help constantly noticing the ducting and conduit that covers the ceilings.But then the food. &#160;I was ready to look past the interior space as I prepared for delicious filling plates of thoughtfully cooked and presented seafood. &#160;The 12$ dollar clam and chorizo dish contained no more than 14 clams...4 of which were closed. &#160;Add three pieces of sliced chirizo and your paying roughly 1.20 cents a clam....ouch.The ahi sashimi dish we had next was roughly a 4 ounce serving of tuna with a adornment of frisee for color. &#160;Three bites each and that's done. &#160;Good flavor but tough to swallow at 10$.Albacore was next as a main dish which was well cooked, a decent size meat portion yet only adorned with pea shoots (no rice or sesame noodles??). &#160;22$ dollars wasnt outrageous, but the dish was un-inspired and like something I would cook at home.Add two oysters, a mineral water and two espressos and we were out the door for 65 dollars before tip but underwhelmed and HUNGRY for plates that actually have more than a few bites on each of them. &#160;Small plates of food are ok with me but when they generally lack inspiration, its leaves a bad taste in my mouth that the old location never did. Flying Fish is still one of my very favorite places in all of Seattle. &#160;I wasn't sure how their new location would turn out, but wow! &#160;Wide, open space with a lot of natural light (even on a grey afternoon). &#160;Clean lines, contemporary (but comfortable) design, and a lot more seating than their previous space.We started off with a round of drinks (all perfectly concocted) and an order of the calamari and a fried oyster caesar salad. &#160;I spotted a few new items on their menu, but I absolutely had to go with these. &#160;They're my favorites and consistently perfect. &#160;The calamari is flawlessly fried and I love the aoli and green pepper sauce served with it. &#160;And the fried oysters? &#160;I typically can't stand them, but they manage to be tender and flavorful and in no way greasy or oily.For an entrees I ordered the Mahi Mahi and the others at the table ordered the fried chicken and the halibut. &#160;The Mahi Mahi was very moist and tender and full of flavor. &#160;The fried chicken was perfectly fried. &#160;Crispy crust and beyond juicy meat. &#160;That butter milk batter really works wonders and while it takes 45 mins to make, it's well worth the wait. &#160;The halibut that was ordered was good too. &#160;The butter sauce really heightened the fish and make it oh so rich and decadent.For dessert we had the peach cobbler and the pavlova. &#160;The peach cobbler had a great crust, was served pipping hot, and had a nice serving of ice cream on top. &#160;It was sweet, but not too sweet.... the peach flavor really shined through. &#160;The pavlova (the first I've ever had!) was everything I had hoped it would be. &#160;The preparation didn't seem very traditional, but it was packed with unique tastes. &#160;The saffron pavlova combined with cardamom ice cream added a great, almost earthy flavor. &#160;Paired with crazy fresh berries and an assortment of nuts and I was one happy camper. &#160;If you're looking for a sweet way to finish off your meal I wouldn't necessarily recommend this dish, but it was so unique and I've never had anything like it. &#160;If it's on the menu next time I'll DEFINITELY order it. &#160;It also paired very well with the late harvest gewurztraminer (at least I think it was a gewurztraminer). &#160;Service was friendly and I can't think of a more perfect dinner. &#160;Their new location is even better than their Belltown spot (access to parking here!) and I foresee many, many trips back here. Went there for a dear friends going away dinner. Fantastic fish taco's! Probably the best. Everything was great and the service was friendly...up until my fried calamari came out. The cilantro sauce was scrumptious - sweet - but good. The calamari came out with a few undercooked pieces that tasted like someone rubbed a dead fish on them. Slimy - and raw. I was hesitant to send them back because it was busy...I've served for 7 years and I know how it is. After three other people at my table tasted the raw piece of squid, and confirmed how gross they were, I decided to tell the server. I definitely sensed she was annoyed and I felt bad but hey, what can you do. She took it to the kitchen, offered to redo the calamari but I had lost my appetite and politely declined. This is the part that get's three star's knock off. The server, for whatever reason, decided to come back to inform me that the she (and the kitchen) had "tasted" the calamari I sent back and that it was just fine. She proceeded to insist that the calamari was just "really REALLY fresh". HA! So apparently, my taste buds are not sophisticated enough to tell the difference between "nasty/raw" and "fresh/delish". I felt like her comments were really unnecessary, rude and perhaps a bit condescending. Not sure I'll go back :( We had another one of those discount dining coupons to use and a few errands to run in Seattle so we decided to give this place a try for dinner a few weeks ago. &#160;We arrived here around 6 on Saturday and there were only a few other tables dining. &#160;By the time we left the place was packed and there was a decent wait for a table. &#160;We didn't have any issues finding street parking in the area.I ordered their mushroom risotto. &#160;I was disappointed since I had read some of the reviews on Yelp talking about the scallop &amp; mushroom risotto. &#160;Unfortunately there weren't any scallops in this one. ..however there were plenty of fish bones. &#160;Now I should have expected that it would be cooked with a seafood stock, since this is a seafood restaurant. &#160;However, I was not expecting there to be so many bones in their stock. &#160;My plate of risotto had nearly a dozen bones in it. &#160;So if you order the risotto make sure to carefully pick through it, or else you'll end up with a nasty surprise. &#160;Other than the bones, my risotto was okay, but it was a little overcooked. &#160;My boyfriend's halibut was really the star of our meal. &#160;It was probably one of the best pieces of fish I've tried in my life. &#160;We both also got dessert, although I think we should have only gotten one since by then we were too full to finish either dessert. &#160;I got the salted caramel pot de cr&#232;me and my boyfriend got the brownie. &#160;They were both decent, but I don't think they were worth the price so I was glad we had the coupon.If I could base my review just on the halibut, this would maybe be a four or even five star review. &#160;But when I factor in our other courses, I think I can only justify a three star rating. Like other posters I bought a Groupon and, like others, wish I had bought more. Fabulous place! Great decor, seating is close but doesn't feel clausterphobic. The platters are a great deal. My friend and I had the dungeness crap platter which was pretty pricey at a 26$ per lb, 2 lb min., but it was really delicious and we had a good laugh getting "down home" in crab cracking. Not very elegant! But big cheers for the damp, warmed napkins which arrived to wipe down with. We shared the dungeness endive salad as a started and I don't realy recommend it. The bitterness of the endive seemed even more intense because it was charred rather than carmelized. Oh well...Service great, food great, location great, (right on the SLUT) so why 4 stars? No bottles of wine under 20$. I know this is a classy place but there is great Washington wine available for those of us with limited budgets. I certainly plan on going to happy hour there! I can't speak to the regular menu at Flying Fish because on my visit I was there for their 8th annual Oyster Frenzy. &#160;WOW is all I can say! &#160;I was visiting the region and have never really eaten so many raw oysters that I could discern between them so it was an amazing experience. &#160;There were about 6-7 different fish mongers serving the oysters raw and there was also oysters rockefeller, fried oysters and oyster stew. &#160;Of course there was also ample amount of lemon slices, horseradish, and cocktail sauce. &#160;It was an all-you-can-eat extravaganza and we did out best! &#160;I have never eaten so many oysters in my life and I'm grateful for the wonderful experience. &#160;The restaurant was lovely and surely looked like a great place to eat at other times. &#160;So glad my friend got tix for this event for my visit! I like the new location - more space, more outdoor seating, easier parking. I like their happy hour - most everything is pretty good. I love the $0.25 oyster happy hour. The Vietnamese style crab was delish. Not sure if the crab is the best date food b/c you will be covered with the sauce. The other dishes I've had there have been pretty good. The servers are very attentive and sweet. The yearly oyster frenzy in October is a must. This year they had 6 vendors with 10,000 oysters per vendor so you can eat oysters till you pass out. The soup, wine pairings, cooked oysters were also good at the frenzy. The owner is really nice and she will come around to see how your dinner was. I have to be honest, I wasn't head over heels in love with Flying Fish. I've been to many seafood restaurants, and I heard rave reviews about this restaurant. However, it really didn't measure up. Some of the fish that members of my group ordered weren't fresh. I mean, HELLO? You're claiming to be the best seafood restaurant in Seattle, and you don't get fresh fish?? Very confusing. Everything else (besides the main courses, ha) was ok, but it was sooooooooo LOUD in this restaurant that I could barely here the person sitting next to me. And the service was ssslllooowww. The one thing that I really did enjoy, however, was dessert (warm grappa brownie), but it's almost not worth commenting on given that we had to endure mediocre food, bad service, and a noisy unpleasant atmosphere. Oh, dear. Another disappointing dinner out. Let's begin at the beginning. Our server had no idea that she had our table. And, so, our party of six (kind of hard to ignore, but everyone on the floor at flying fish did so) sat for 20 minutes utterly ignored at 7 p.m. on a Saturday night. (Don't want to start selling us liquor early and often? Geez.) Not one person passing us by repeatedly (we sat next to the drink service and 10 feet from the kitchen counter) asked if they could help us or would even make eye contact. And that includes the floor manager. He, by the way, was busy eyeballing each wineglass for spots and chunks. We know this because 1) we had nothing to do but watch him 2) our own bread plates were coated in a crusty grime. They must be having some trouble with the diswasher there.We finally stick our faces in front of a server running with plates to ask if we were going to have a server of our own. Ours finally appears. She's kinda sorry. But no amends were made until after we ordered dessert (two for the table), and then she told us those were on the house. Yes, it was an effort. But we were left to stew, and she didn't announce the offer up front.The food? The fried oyster caesar salad SHOULD have been the stuff of dreams. Instead, the oysters were three pieces of crusty breading tucked into the side of the plate. The ahi poke was very good, but served without condiments. The room? Our architect dining companions described it as "a school lunch room." But a nice one. You know, like one recently remodeled a community college.I will say the wine list is very good (you can get a Leonetti by the glass) and the prices reasonable. But you can say the same thing about Pete's or Esquin.Would we spend our hard-earned dollars here again? Nope. I went here with my parents who came into town to visit. I'd been to Flying Fish back when it was in Belltown and enjoyed it, but this was my first time going back since they moved.I was really underwhelmed. The atmosphere of the old place has been destroyed for a clean, modern type of look. That's fine, we came here for the food anyway. But the food wasn't good either, and certainly not worth the prices. I ordered the albacore and my mom had the udon noodle salmon, both of which were very spicy, despite there being nothing on the menu about it. The salmon was too heavily spiced, and my albacore didn't go well with the included bok choy and wasabi.We also felt the staff was a bit snooty.All in all, mediocre to sub-mediocre food for a too-high price. I love Flying Fish! I went here with two other friends and everything we had was fantastic. Our server was attentive, but she never hovered. The wine we ordered was delicious....we started with the calamari, which we loved. I ordered the Barramundi (which I have never had before), and it was SO GOOD. It came with pistachios (which sounds weird), fingerling potatoes, and broccoli. The flavor combinations were so great, and the fish was cooked perfectly. My friend had the salmon and my other friend had the swordfish. I tried both and they were both delicious. We ended the night with the apple pie and the brownie. They were great....but the brownie is more like a lava cake. It's not really a brownie. Anyway, my experience was awesome and I can't wait to go back! Oh no, I fear I have an Ono addiction. Flying Fish is so good they've got me seeing stars. Five stars. Five big stars. Five big, red stars. Woohoo! As good as it gets! I have found reasons to visit Flying Fish twice this month, once for lunch and once for dinner. Each visit leaves me singing this SLU restaurant's praises. Their small plate Thai crab cake is easily the best crab cake I have had to date. It's plump and fresh and divine. Their calamari stands on its own, but accompanied by the slightly spicy jalapeno sauce, it is DELICIOUS. As for the large plates, try the grilled Ono. You can send your thanks afterward. It's slightly sweet and very hearty for such a delicate tasting fish. I can attest that the seared Mahi Mahi is also delicious and worth every penny. If I could afford to eat there every day, I would, but I can't, so it will remain a restaurant that is perfect for a special occasion or a date spot. Just make sure your date isn't a vegetarian because there isn't anything on the menu that will cater to them. Go, go, go, ONO. Ummm...Flying Fish is ok.While &#160;the space is beautiful and the location convenient (south lake union, people!), I'm not won over by their food. Yet?Maybe.I understand it's a Seattle staple, but I'm just not all that impressed. &#160;The heirloom tomato salad was quite good, but the risotto was marginal.My dining mate said her fried chicken was a bit undercooked, but her crab cake was excellent.My cocktail was like rubbing alcohol and her drink was pleasant.They were the same drink.Can't decide.I'd like to try their lunch out, but I'm just not sure if I can bring myself to do so.What do you think I should do, dear readers? This was my first visit to Flying Fish and was really excited. &#160;My friend and I went for her Birthday dinner and wanted a fun night out. &#160;The location is great, the decor is very modern, concrete, open ceiling, and plenty of good seating outside. &#160;Our waiter was "OK" he wasn't very engaging and after telling him it was our first time there, still not much of a response..so that was a little disappointing. &#160;I read the reviews before we went and tried a few different items- the clams- crispy soft shell crab for apps- both were just good not stellar &#160;and could have used a little more flavor. &#160;Then we got the blackened Albacore and Crispy Sea Bass- again both good but could have used a little more flavor or sauce. &#160;We both tried desserts since it was a Birthday and all - we got the cherry cobbler and the salted carmel pot. &#160;I really wanted to like the cobbler, because it looked really good, but a little too lemony. &#160;Not what we expected and the salted carmel was great for a few bites with the fresh whipped cream, but then after awhile it really tasted like butterscotch. &#160;From the style of the restaurant &amp; menu it didn't live up to the expectations.
First off. The worst bloody mary in my life. This includes the backroad truck stop underage serving bars I've found in the boonies of Montana and Idaho. Crappy vodka with a few drops of clamato, that's it. Thing was g'damn clear.This was at 8:30PM on a Thursday, which is still fairly mellow. But by 10 or 11 the place transforms into a full blown college bar, chock-full of stupid. Not rated based on this, but just an FYI if you plan on coming here late.Their food at night turns more meaty, which isn't bad being as I'm a meat eater, but my dinner guest is not. Vegan choices go to hell without the buffet. Food was ok, but not great, ho-hum at the very best.I'll try the place again for the buffet, but I doubt I'll ever come here for dinner. I'll go a few blocks away to Araya's instead for my veggie fix. Then get booze where the bartender can do more than poor beer and wine. It's fun to traipse around the U-District admiring all the local establishments that are oozing with students. Finding a cheap eat is simple in the area, and Flowers is a good spot to step into on any day. They are very vegetarian friendly and known for their veggie buffet that showcases middle eastern and Indian flavors. I really wish we had opted for an earlier lunch as opposed to 2:45pm because there was not much of a buffet left. Word to the wise: go early and eat up because it looked delish. The sandwich menu will please anyone with steak, chicken, fish and veggie options. The warm eggplant sandwich with tomato sauce was great. You can choose from salad or fries and all sandwiches go for $8. Funky table decor and an inviting staff make this a perfect lunch spot. Even better, their bar serves up a daily happy hour. Weekday lunch buffet is really good! &#160;I love the variety of stuff that you can get there at lunch time. &#160;I do like the vegetarian options there...and to be able to eat all that you want. &#160;It's sort of a quasi-hippie place, and I like that atmosphere in the U-District...sort of alternative...with an unpretentious decor on the University Ave. And, it's nice to sit and people watch with a table by the window. I actually like the buffet a lot, but more and more when I make plans to meet a friend for lunch, I'm outside waiting for them so we can go find a restaurant that decided to open. &#160;Not sure if they've changed their buffet days, but it's not posted, so as far as I can tell, they occasionally just don't bother opening.The service is never really good, but for the buffet, who cares. Ever since I moved into the dorms back in 2002 I have wanted to go to Flower's. Walking by, the people in there always looked like they were having so much fun. They decor is very attractive and cozy. &#160;For some reason or another I just never made it there. &#160;UNTIL we made it the sixth bar on our Ave Crawl. It was only about 10pm and we had a pretty large group. &#160;It was easy to find a table and most of us ordered the margarita since it was on special for $4. Definitely not the right thing to order. Weak on the tequila and the marg mix was pretty nasty. &#160;For some reason I thought that since this place was vegan/vegetarian they would be more ingredient-conscious and make their drinks from scratch. Ooops - I forgot that we were still in the Udistrict. I'd go back to try the food though and might end up amending my review. I've been here for the lunch buffet and at night for dinner and drinks.The lunch buffet seems like a good value if you eat a lot and have a hard time finding good vegetarian food in the U-District. Otherwise, I'd say it's just okay.The place has a mirror ceiling, old chairs, and mismatched, painted tables that makes for a cool ambiance.The bar at night is also a good haven away from classless Earl's or the sorority/fraternity overload at Finn MacCool's.I say try it out! I was staying in the U District, on bid'ness from NY. I wandered into Flowers because: a.) it was the only (or least) college-y place near UW. b.) I adore places that keep the original signs from the buildings they now inhabit (hence the name "Flowers").c.) the space actually reminded me of Enid's, in BrooklynFlowers isn't as vegan/vegetarian as it states here, as I found a chicken with mushrooms and linguine dish on the menu. It was... ok. The margaritas, however, are fantastic. Too fantastic, in fact, if you get my drift.The staff was less than friendly, but not rude, so it doesn't really bother me. I do, however, like how the place has two full walls of windows, which is great for watching those myriad frat kids in their natural environment. I've never eaten at Flowers, but I have been in several times for drinks. I think that you can't complete a successful tenure at the university of washington without going to Flowers, getting tipsy, and looking at and/or taking a photo of yourself and friends in the mirrored ceiling of Flowers. To be fair, this review is a bit inflated to reflect the quality of Flowers in comparison to other offerings on the Ave, but I always have an enjoyable time there, and they make a very boozy &#160;cocktail. Their happy hour is rad, with a different drink special every day for something like $3. Pretty winning, in my opinion. I've only been to Flowers for the vegan lunch buffet. It's a weird but large assortment of vegetarian items: Indian curries, pasta dishes, Mediterranean entrees, tofu stir fries, mysterious sauces. It's greasy. The service is bad. But I like it, and I will go back! It's great if you like buffets where you can eat everything without accidentally eating meat and if you like eating lots of different kinds of foods at once. I really like Flowers. &#160;I recently had the lunch buffet for the first time in a long time (3 years?) and it was good but I prefer the dinner menu. &#160;The pistachio-crusted chicken sandwich is my favorite and I like that they put pepper on their fries (I know, I'm weird). &#160;The atmosphere is usually really laid back which is nice. &#160;The service can be pretty slow and unhelpful but hey, it's the U-district, what do you expect? I like Flowers. It's a good place to just hang out. It's dim at night, which is cool, and it's all windows, so there's pretty excellent people-watching when you're tipsy and distracted. The food is pretty good I'd say, though a tad bit pricey, but I've never had anything I didn't like, and they tend to make their drinks strong--so you get a bang for your buck. Out of all the bars on the Ave, it's probably my fave, if only because it's not overrun with drunken frat boys and half-clothed sorority sisters lookin' for some fun. The waitresses are nice, the service is good (contrary to what most of the folk on here have to say), and the feel is low-key and laid back. It's pretty good. Yes. Flowers is the only bar on the "Ave" I would ever consider going to. The ambiance is great and the service good. I usually order the Chicken Crusted sandwich and a cocktail. If ever your in the area I would recommend going. The drinks are stiff and the people watching aspect is pretty darn good.
I've now dined at Ciao Bella twice and cannot wait to go back.After finding most other restaurants closed on Memorial Day, our family friends suggested one of their neighborhood favorites. While I don't remember the first time I ate at Ciao Bella all that well, I can certainly say I'll return after this most recent visit. They fit us right in despite our late and unannounced arrival.Contrary to what Jon B. has to say - I think the pizza is awesome. Sure, some of the food is standard restaurant Italian. Yet the diverse offerings and delicious results are more than enough to justify the higher than average prices. Ciao Bella is a great neighborhood eatery, offering style and a solid wine selection. If you're looking for good Italian in the U-District or Laurelhurst, check out Ciao Bella. I work nearby and one of my clients told me they found my business because it was next to their favorite Italian restaurant. &#160;Long story short, now it's my favorite restaurant. Fair prices, good service and outstanding food. Highly recommend it!!
Since they moved to their new location I haven't visited, however I used to go on a regular basis a few years ago. Therefore this review will be on the last time I went, until I have the time to go to the new one and update it.Good food, great service, decent prices, pretty much sums it up. They give you bread and oil, it's good and warm and usually gets eaten within two minutes of arriving on the table. The actual entrees are good, but could be better. They don't have a ton of vegetarian options, only 2-3 pasta dishes. My favorite was always a mushroom ravoli in a cream sauce.. oh that cream sauce is to die for. Mmmm.The waitstaff is always attentive, usually pretty nice and friendly as well. The decor is appropriate, clean, and tasteful. The bill usually ends up being between $15-20/person, which for decent Italian food isn't bad. I'll definitely have to make time in my schedule to stop by their new location and see if it's as good as the old one!
When all the other sushi restaurants are closed on a Saturday afternoon, these guys are not only open but serving well-priced lunch specials. &#160;A bowl of sticky rice with your choice of sushi runs between $8 and $14. &#160;This price includes miso soup, a mini-appetizer, and a fragrant cup of tea afterward. &#160;The sushi is very fresh, though not terribly inspired. I very much so enjoyed the decor. I'd been to the previous restaurant, Chinoise, before and I thought it was alright. So when I saw it had turned into a new place, I thought about giving it a try. (but foodie-sense goes crazy, b/c usually a good place that gets sold = goes down hill...)Anyway, the reason we actually came here was b/c Musashi's was closed. (not my #1 for japanese food either, but it's nearby) The inside had hardly changed from my memory. Nice design that feels welcoming (b/c of the warm wood feel), but not so trendy so that it feels like it's for the uber chic. Onto the food! Food ordered: beef sukiyaki rice bowl, sushi combo B, sashimi half order, unagi roll, and agedashi tofu. Sounds like a lot eh? Well, that was for 3 people, and was barely enough to fill us. (good thing trophy cupcake is across the street!) The fish was very good, tasted very fresh and had very good texture/flavor. The beef sukiyaki bowl, according to my friend, wasn't as good as it looked. (also didn't have a lot of meat). Unagi rolls should not exist, b/c it's just a tease in a freaking rice blanket. Finally the agedashi tofu was alright, but the tofu used is a little more firm and larger than what I've eaten in the past. All in all, I'd say stick to the fish. However, expect to open your wallet up b/c this place isn't as cheap as you might initially think. Prices look reasonable on the menu, but before you know it, you're going to want to order a little more b/c the portion you just ate wasn't quite enough. Going to try happy hour next time. We stumbled on this on our way to May Thai. We saw food pictures on the window and peered in to see a large open room with a vaulted ceilings. The menu is not overwhelming but we wanted to eat everything. We settled on agedashi tofu, omakase sashimi, spicy scallop roll, stone grilled pork belly, and a minced chicken ball. It was all delicious.Agedashi tofu was perfect, crispy on the outside and melty soft inside. The omakase sashim was mackerel, salmon, maguro and albacore. I don't normally like mackerel - I find it fishy- but this was the best I'd ever had. The rest of the plate was okay- the albacore was seared, which I don't like. Tthe spicy scallop was so good- it was actually spicy (and NOT CREAMY) and had a great balance so that it was very fresh and light. My new favorite. The grilled pork belly and minced chicken ball were also great. The place has a really laid back vibe- has high ceilings and skylights- very nice. We'll be back! NANKOTSU! &#160;Delectable, crispy fried pieces of chicken cartilage! &#160;This place is authentic and definitely one of my favorites. Love the late hour dining on weekends.Service was great. No complaints there.$12 dollar pitchers of Sapporo. &#160;Prices were fair.Had stone grilled salmon and filet mignon. &#160;Great texture and appealing presentation.Sushi wasn't anything to rave about. &#160;Pretty standard for Seattle quality.All in all, food came out without any noticeable delay.Would definitely come back here and try other items on the menu This is a Isakaya style restaurant. You order a bunch of small dishes and share. Nice atmosphere...But, the food was not up to par on the night we went. A few dishes did work well like the Korean style stone BBQ meat...chicken karage was good too, and eggplant not bad.But, overall a little too greasy, and a few dishes failed like the croquets (that must have been frozen and thawed). Not bad, but won't go back... Decisions, decisions...my first 3-star rating...but not without a well thought out pro and con list to back up my current review. With only two mouths to feed tonight I was looking for something 'new' try but it had to be something my teenager would want to eat...after much deliberation we ended up agreeing on having Japanese cuisine. After walking down 45th for a few minutes I was confronted with three choices all in the same area...Kitaro, Issian and Kozue. I chose Issian because of the style of food they served. I've had all sorts of Japanese cuisine in my lifetime but I've never been in an Isakaya style restaurant. At first glace, I thought I had walked into a sushi bar because of the communal seating option at the bar but I later learned that it was to display the type for grilling they used to prepare their dishes. I opted for a table this time. The ambiance was simple but comfortable...we came in during happy hour but noticed that there was a variety of patrons - from a family of four, to a group of friends, to varying couples and another mom+daughter combination close by. We ordered two stone-grilled dishes, I had the rib-eye while my daughter had the chicken. In addition to the grilled meats, we ordered a tempura plate and a plate of tekka maki to complete our meal. At first, I wasn't sure if this was enough...I've tried the small plate concept before and have ended up adding more orders after the first. I was quite please with everything we ordered...the rib-eye was tender and had an interesting marination and a sauce that went well with the greens it came with. The chicken was prepared with a lemon/pepper combination and also topped off with a sauce that was also good with the greens. The tempura and sushi was to par with other places we've had these dishes before...overall a very satisfying meal. OK...if all the dishes were satisfying...then why the 3-stars? I have to admit that although the dishes were very good, I was disappointed with the amount to time it took for the food to come...each dish came one right after the other rather than all at once. By the time we were finished with one dish there was a few minutes wait for the next to come...granted...it was happy hour (I'm reaching here)...other than the wait time (we were there for a little over an hour), this place was great. I'm willing to come back and try more stone-grilled dishes so I'm hoping the next time the service will be better. We went there on Friday night for the first time because we always wanted to try this place. &#160;It's not a fancy place and the menu is a bit limited, focusing mainly on the grilled dishes. &#160;We didn't try any sushi because 1) we know better places for that and 2) I think it was better to try their grilled dishes for the first time.Would order again:The yakitori and chicken liver were great. &#160;I didn't mind the sauce at all and they tasted really good with the spiced/flavored (?) powder provided. &#160;The dish that made the whole trip worth it is the grilled tuna collar. &#160;For less than $8, we got this fish collar that's the size of my face. &#160;I think we managed to scrape off all the meat and there was a lot of meat. &#160;I wasn't full before the dish, but I was afterward.Would skip the next time:The bacon wrapped mushroom was good, although I will try something else the next time. &#160;I was not impressed with the taco. &#160;It was not crispy nor soft. &#160;We also got one of the beef dishes. &#160;Don't remember the name, but it was $14. &#160;My friend said it was great beef, but we'll skip it in the future. Want to try next:We didn't order the dasi broth tofu and the gyoza. &#160;I really wanted to try them but was very full after the tuna collar. &#160;And after our protein-riched dinner, I was sort of craving for starch. &#160;So next time I'll order these dishes, along with grilled rice balls.Overall:I will definitely go back again and would recommend this place to friends. &#160;We sat at the bar and the chef was very friendly. &#160;Food is cheap but very decent for the price. Service was horrible! The food was alright and the prices were moderate, but the service really downgraded the whole experience. Our group had a bad experience with the main waiter being unaccomodating and we had to make requests for everything. I may give them another try and see if we went on an off day, but my experience was not good.
So the niece and I are just wandering around, trying to find somewhere to eat, looking on my Yelp app, having Google maps fail us over and over...and then we see this place. Yelp says three stars...I am wary...but we're starving so we go for it.Place is empty. At like, 7 PM. Hmmm...now i'm even more wary, but the niece wants Chinese so we sit down. I order Sake. The waitress (who I think was younger than me) freakin grills me on my ID...yes, my hair is longer now, no, my hair is no longer black...OMG I am 27 and I just want a freakin Sake! Okay, she agrees to serve it to me.For dinner we get...veggie egg rolls, broccoli &amp; beef, &amp; general tso's chicken. Everything was great! The egg rolls had a yummy flavor, although a bit mushy. They were served with hot mustard, ketchup, and toasted sesame seeds - I would have liked sweet &amp; sour, but it worked.The broccoli &amp; beef - the broccoli was steamed perfectly, still had a bite to it, the beef was really tender and fresh tasting, and the sauce was perfect.The general tso's chicken was the best though. Huge pieces of white meat chicken, coated in a light, fluffy batter that was slightly crunchy, sweet and spicy due to loads of red pepper flakes. Chinese chicken perfection. I have never had general tso's chicken this good before!My niece and I really enjoyed this place...yummy hole in the wall, somewhat sketchy looking Chinese place you should definitely try! This is my neighborhood Chinese takeout spot, and it ain't so bad.Honestly, some things they get right, some things they don't.I'm gonna talk about takeout mostly, because that's what I usually do. However, I have dined in a couple times. The decor is weird, but the service is great. &#160;Bear in mind if you eat in on a night that the Showbox has booked an act, it'll be loud - you're gonna hear the soundcheck (or the gig). I went here once for dinner JUST to hear the soundcheck. On to the food: Fried Rice - they get it right. VERY flavorful and full of goodies - veggies, egg, meat. And a single order is HUGE.Almond Fried Chicken - they get it almost right. The chicken is perfectly cooked and you get an ample portion. The gravy is a little weird - on the garlicky side, and a dark brown - not the medium brown I was used to growing up. Kung Pao Chicken - Right. plenty of tender chicken along with the usual celery, onions and bell peppers. The cuts on the veggies are a little weird, but now I'm being nitpicky. Plenty of peanuts and swimming in sauce - good for pouring over your rice. Just the right amount of heat and perfectly seasoned.General Tso's Chicken. Great - nice mix of sweet vs. spice. Normally you find chopped scallions mixed in. Theirs has peas. A little weird, but whatever.Mongolian Beef - a tossup. Though the meat is flavorful, it's served on a bed of cabbage and baby corn, rather the crispy rice noodles. Hot &amp; Sour Soup - some of the best in town, full of goodnessGo for the takeout/delivery dinner special (either D1 or D2). Though the special comes with the aforementioned almost-hit Mongolian beef, there's a lot of value for your buck. If I want to eat Chinese 3 meals a day for 3 days, I get the D2. Comes with potstickers, soup, fried rice, barbecued pork, Mongolian Beef and either Sweet &amp; Sour or Almond Chicken. Full servings all around - Dinner for "two" for 22 bucks, but could probably serve 4 easily. It was late last night, we had been having some drinks, and thus, couldn't drive to get any food. So we searched and found this joint and it had iffy reviews, but we were hungry and I am always up for something new.I ordered the Cashew Chicken, and my buddy ordered the salt and pepper pork chops. They estimated around 45-60 minutes for delivery, but the delivery guy showed up in around 30.So I take the first bite into these HUGE strips of chicken and my tongue is thanking me for it. It had a wonderful flavor that was moist and cooked just right. It didn't taste too salty, the sauce they use was very thin which is nice, because most places serve cashew chicken with a sauce that has a texture just barely more pliable than molasses.The only complaint I had was that there were too many bell peppers in my order. I don't care for them, but if you like them, then go for it.I will eat here again. The food was semi-fast, tasted great and made good leftovers for curing a hangover this morning.Thanks Genghis Khan. I gave it four stars because they deliver and open late night. :)Food isn't the best Chinese food I've ever had, but it's definitely not bad.We've ordered from here twice and I've never set foot in the restaurant, but their service is great and delivery is quick.If you're hungry late night and you don't want to venture over to the International District, order from here. The best thing about Genghis Khan - they deliver.Recently having moved to Seattle from the East Coast, we were looking for a place to continue our Sunday night tradition of Chinese food delivery. Genghis Khan was our second try, and we likely won't be revisiting them.Not because they aren't good. The food was pretty decent, but not great. &#160;We ordered the pork fried rice, which was yummy, and the General Tso's Chicken (meh), the Schezuan Eggplant (not great), an egg roll (mushy) and the hot and sour soup (decent). &#160;I'd have to agree with the earlier poster who mentioned that all of the dishes shared the same flavor. Again, not bad food, but I maintain hope that we'll find something better for delivery in Cap Hill. I love this place for delivery. Eat in is good too, buy an appetizer and get $1 beers! We ordered last night and tried the D2 dinner combo. Good stuff. Almond chicken was good - although I've never had it elsewhere - I enjoyed the light crispy batter it was fried in and the crushed almonds on top were delicious! Potstickers and BBQ pork that came with the combo were good as always. Their BBQ pork has more of a pork-y flavor than a sweet flavor. One sticking point - the site I used to order didn't specify a soup to pick, so we got hot &amp; sour. I'm not a fan, so I can't really judge whether it's good or not. And while I was sad the mongolian beef didn't come on a bed of saifun noodles, the beef was decent quality and the veggies were good! Not what I'd call 'traditional' 'american chinese' mongolian beef but tasty nonetheless.And of course - the BBQ pork fried rice was on point as always. Although we didn't order it this time, their General Tso's chicken is the best. A great balance of sweet &amp; spicy with a perfect breading over juicy big chunks of chicken. No fried dough balls here! And their wonton soup is the best I've had. The wontons are filled with pork &amp; shrimp with a good sesame flavor. Mm Mm good. Definitely our go to delivery establishment. Very mediocre Chinese food. Great that they deliver but all of the food tastes the same - from the pork fried rice to the kung pao chicken - they all have the same flavor. The hot and sour soup was just OK and the chow mein noodles were the worst part - the noodles were under cooked and tasted like Chinese fast food. If you can't get chow mein right, what business do you have calling yourself a restaurant that serves "the best tastes of China"? I would recommend going to Panda Express over this place.Genghis Khan was overpriced, poorly cooked and flavored and not worth the money. We found this place looking for Chinese on Christmas and were pleasantly surprised. I wasn't very impressed with the interior or the service or the time it took to get our meal, but the food itself was excellent. I got the Kung Pao Chicken, which was some of the best I've ever had. My wife ordered the Moo Shoo Chicken, which was also very good. We ordered rice and egg rolls for our 4-year old daughter, along with some potstickers.We figured the rice and appetizers would be out fairly quick. They took forever and came out with the rest of our food. The egg rolls were vegetable (not what we had ordered), and we had assumed my Kung Pao Chicken would come with its own rice, but either they erred again, or we were mistaken, because the only rice on the table was the single small bowl that was either for my entree, or the order for our daughter. With it being Christmas night and us feeling lucky to have found an open Chinese place (for some weird reason, it's a family tradition for us to grab Chinese on Christmas night), we didn't grumble at the long wait time for our food or the egg roll mistake, or the rice. We figured they were understaffed. The food tasted great, and we'll be back next year. On vacation in Seattle and the family was hungry!We stopped here and ordered some really good egg rolls for apps then I ordered Kung Pao chicken, my dad the peanut chicken. Each was pretty good and plentiful with rice. The veggies were cooked right and my dish had a good amount of flavor. Overall a good place to a $10~ Dinner. Side note: Not the biggest fan of decorations or the band practicing upstairs. (not a date location lol) I ate here while I was on vacation from California. It was one of the best, if not THE best, Chinese food places I've eaten. &#160;I had the sesame chicken, chicken chow mien, and white rice. Can't wait to go back. I am strictly rating the general tsaos chicken in this review. It was the first thing I ever ordered from here and I've been addicted ever since. Hands down the BEST general tsaos ever. The chicken is super juicy and all really good white meat. One order is totally enough to stuff 2 people. Delivery is always on time if not early too! Plus the deliver to capitol hill which is awesome! If I could give them an extra star for that I would. Mmm. too bad they are closed right now or else I'd give them a call..... This place was open on Christmas night, they had already closed but still served us. The atmosphere was nothing special but the food just plane rox! We had wonton soup, sesame chicken, Szechwan chicken, and spicy beef. I have to say that &#160;all dishes were prepared to perfection and my glass was never empty. Way to be perfect Mr. Khan! This place has great broccoli and beef, fried rice, and crispy noodle at very affordable prices. It looks pretty shady on the outside, but my friend and I were feeling adventurous one day, and ventured in. The food is yummy, and if you go when there's a show on at The Showbox, you get to feel like you are backstage? or behind a speaker? at the show. The service is friendly and they remember what your favorite dish is, and I've always gotten my food pretty quickly there. They do put a lot of garlic in some of the dishes, so it may not be the best restaurant for a first date, although my boyfriend and I managed to start frequenting the place only a few months after we started dating, and we're still together... &#160;In any case, it's a nice, kind of homely, unpretentious place, and the food far exceeds any expectations that may be set by the decor.
Great place for won ton mein (noodles) and congee (rice porridge). &#160;Not much else on the menu. &#160;Very small shop frequented by actual Chinese people. I'm not really a fan of egg noodles but I sure LOOOVVE congee. I think this is the best place in town for congee, yet. After I'm done with one bowl, I am already wanting to order another... lol. Love the congee. I like the water cress congee while my wife usually order the black chicken congee. That's right! Black chicken, even the meat's color is black. &#160;I also like the beef brisket egg noodle with soup on the side. &#160;Since the renovation, the place is cleaner &amp; better. Couldn't try the congee (they had run out), but we did get a couple bowls of the wonton noodle soup and a platter of beef brisket with bok choy, and it was all great. They closed about half an hour early because "no more noodles." The best wonton noodle in town! &#160;=) &#160;Come on a busy day and expect to wait and/or sit next to someone you don't know! &#160;LOL &#160;They allow such thing here. &#160;Get past the whole Asian "maximum capacity" deal and you'll find yourself a treasure in ID!The wonton was wonderful with big shrimp, nothing is second rated or shortcut here. &#160;Move on to the wonderful beef and broth. &#160;Fantastic! &#160;Come out really hot and the noodle is real good. =)*The congee is quite wonderful as well.And the ticket is cheap for something so wonderful. &#160;Come here if you are in the mood for wonton noodle, you will be pleased. I give 4 stars for this cute little noodle joint.1. clean interior and bathroom2. the server in her late 30's or early 40's is a sassy dresser, I found her to be very polite and accommodating. 3. the chef/owner, is that tall guy Mike? He seems to be very easy going and nice to his staff, it's a big ++ and he is almost as tall as me and I'm 6'1", good to see another tall fine looking Asian man in the hood.4. Based on Nina's review, I was going to order chowmein but didn't see it on the menu. I was little timid to ask for special since it was already after 8PM and they were taking orders from 6 different table at the time... so I ordered egg noodle with julienned pork in sweet and spicy sauce along with steam wonton with shoyu and jalapeno dipping sauce. I thought the noodle sauce was little too sweet for me but it complimented the pork and noodle fairly well.I'm sure that I will stop by again to see them run a fine place. Probably the best place in Seattle to get a generous serving of thick congee. &#160;Sampan and rock cod congee are the best selections. &#160;Service is fast. It is a tiny place. You should get there before 11am (weekends and weekdays) to ensure a seat. &#160;Cash only. Good place to come for jook (congee) for breakfast. &#160;No serious crowd, and the jook is good. &#160;I like my sliced beef pei dan jook. &#160;Their pei dan pork jook is with cubed pork instead of slice that's why I didn't order it. &#160;I'll have a more updated version when I've tried more of their food. From the outside Mike's looks like a total hole in the wall type place as it looks small, in a pretty cheap rent area, and probably has a line outside the door.From the inside however, its quite a bit more. &#160;Its actually clean, the staff is well dressed (and by well dressed I don't mean a faded t-shirt that say's Mike's Noodle House), tables are neat and not wobbly, and the menu's are clean and readable. &#160;As for the food, well if you like Noodles you're in luck because there's no false advertising in this name (over half the menu is noodle dishes). &#160;That said, they do also serve congee and a few other dishes, but if you're coming here its probably for the wonton noodle soup which is probably the most popular item. &#160;Personally, I like this place better than Canton Wonton &amp; Ocean City as its cleaner and the wonton's are a lot bigger. &#160;The broth is somewhat comparable, but really its all about the wonton's. &#160;So if you like meaty wonton's and a clean restaurant feel free to add Mike's to your list of eats. This place is so good, that they can treat their customers the way they do.Everything there is fresh - you can see the lady rolling each dumpling by hand. &#160;Flavor's great - not too heavy!They tend to run out of the good stuff being that they're the good stuff. &#160;Definitely call in advance for the hours posted are suggested hours. &#160;They've been know to close whenever the f they want. &#160;But if you call and get through the language barrier that you're on your way (w/in their time limit) they will stay open for you.It's probably 4-stars but they intimidate me so much, they get another star!-1 star, I just tried going the other night at 7 and it was closed even though sign says 9. &#160;I was craving it too! &#160;That was my 3rd attempt and all three times, they were closed! &#160;This almost calls for a boycott.... My father-in-law, who is never wrong about food and who has a job that enables him to travel all over Asia, opts to go to THIS place if he's feeling like a bowl of noodles in Seattle. Best place to go for wonton noodle soup in my book! One of my favorites for a lunch outing. Esp. when its cold outside.It's small- it's not pretty- but its super cheap &amp; cash only!The food is mm mm good when you want some warm soup in your belly. The ID is meant for... Hot, fast, cheap, and delicious asian food. &#160;Mike's serves up the classic quick chinese lunch/ breakfast; noodle soup and congee. &#160;I work in downtown, and I've been able to get there and back in about an hour for lunch. &#160;(That is if you don't mind sharing a table from time to time. &#160;The space is small and it's busy...)Definitely recommend it. This is a tiny and crowded place but offers prompt and efficient services. &#160;Better to go there on a weekday for lunch, if you don't want to wait in line forever. &#160;I highly recommend their rock cod congee (don't forget to order a side bok choy dish to put in the congee) with a dab of the red spicy sauce.The serving is huge so you will leave the place very full and very happy.Don't even think of going there for dinner. &#160;They close early. &#160;I have made that mistake twice and was left hungry and longing for that hot, tasty congee!!! To all the yelpers who thought it was odd that strangers were seated on the same table, it's actually common in some places in asia where the restaurant is small but yet very busy.I think for noodle wonton, the broth is perfectly balanced, the wontons were delicious. &#160;We had a big group too.The liver thinging is pretty good too for those who like to be adventurous.Definitely one of the best wonton noodle in the west coast. Whoo-hoo, congee! I now have options as for where I want to get my congee at the ID. As far as congee is concerned, it's not too different from the ones at Ocean City, but they do have more choices (like squid ball, sui-kau, sliced beef, sliced pork, beef brisket, beef ball, pork ball, etc)... and they put in a LOT of meat... and their prices are pretty darn good. Their business seems to revolve completely around noodles or congee. (Will everyone of my sentences have congee in it? Why, I will sure try, congee-congee.)For a congee and noodle place, the place is crazy packed; we hung on tightly to the menu when we were handed one, as it seemed to be our ticket to get seated. It took the five of us about 35 minutes to get seated - we wanted to know why all these other people were waiting along with us. Next to Jade Garden, this seems to be next in the running for crazy popularity, considering people are willing enough to wait in a crammed place and spill outdoors just to get some o' that Mike's noodles and congee. The place is really quite small place, though, so I'm rather perplexed as to some of the people who seem to be regulars - or whatev - who bring an 8-person family there; just imagine the wait to be seated..... congee.P.S. Interesting note - this is the first time I have ever been served tea in a kitchen-plastic cup. There has been tons of talk on Congee so i'd thought i'd talk about the noodle soup, that after all these years I can't not order.This place is crazy busy! But the wait was short, even for my family of 6. We were promptly seated and served, Everyone ordered brisket and won tons, except for my brother who got his dry style, which by the way is probably the best dry style egg noodle dish in all of the damned city. The soup was balanced, and the meat cooked beautifully, soft and not over seasoned, maybe one of the best cooked soup briskets in town. The won tons were good, but not top tier, &#160;the noodles were amazing. I am not sure where they get them, or if they prepare them themselves, but these are also one of the shining gems of the experience. With that said, i don't know if i'd go anywhere else besides mike's for egg noodle soup. The Soy bean milk is made in house. bonus points for that. This place is pretty good but it's small and often crowded. The first time I went it was late at night and it wasn't crowded, so the service was great then. But the second time I went, it was during lunch and it was crowded beyond belief. When I was finally pointed to a chair with strangers I ordered number 6 but the gave me number 7. I told the waitress that it was the wrong order and she basically glared at me and took it away. Another waitress came over and basically said I ordered number 7. I politely responded that I ordered number 6 but she was like "NO, your ordered number 7!". Eventually my order came up and it was good. But the service really pissed me off.The restaurant is good, whether it be wontons, noodles, or congee; but try avoiding this place when it's crowded... This is my new favorite noodle joint.. why??1. it's cheap2. very nice service, and pretty hostess..btw I am not a lesbian but I appreciate a pretty girl.. and there was a girl working there that was pretty with big fake tits haha3. I love egg noodles.. and their egg noodles were amazing4. the soup tasted so fresh and tasty5. the soup came out lightening fast..what else do you want to know ?????updated for tony g.6. chow mein is great.. you can have homemade noodles, buckwheat noodles, or just chowmein7. soups - all kinds of soups. spicy.beefy.vegetarian if that's what you want.8. they have their own specialty items, try it.. it's very different but good different It's tiny, It's busy, It's crowded beyond belief, and every time I've ever been there, I am the whitest thing going for blocks. It's your first clue when you walk in at lunch time that you've found a good noodle house.The service was very good, even my first time there when I had nary a clue what I was trying to order.Willing to be adventerous enough to eat it w/o asking what it is is all part of the experience.I've sampled a good half of the menu since my first visit in October now, and am sooo glad it's in w/in walking distance of work (Well, thanks my hour lunch anyway) or a short bus hop if I'm cramped for time.Not met a dish I haven't enjoyed yet, but I'll keep trying.
Meh. This place is my last resort when I'm looking for a small quick bite. I've only tried their banh cuon, eggrolls, and a few hot dishes but I wasn't very impressed. The place is tiny, you can probably fit 5 people max at any one time. One thing that I definitely buy here are their eggrolls. They have tiny eggrolls which are 4 for $1 and they're yummy! When we go to dinner parties and I don't have time to make anything, this is the first place that I stop at to pick up some of their small eggrolls. It's a great deal and always a hit at parties. We landed in Seattle last Sunday and only had a brief window for lunch before work took over. The other sandwich spot I'd bookmarked (Paseo) was still closed and Banh Cuon was only a mile from our hotel. Always up for a banh mi, I was on my way.After a short walk, I ended up in a small Asian district familiar to the ones I frequent here in Dallas. I wandered in to Banh Cuon and went into sensory overload with all the food on display. Dumplings, spring rolls, mung bean cakes and plenty of things I'd never really seen before were right in front of me. I settled on a chicken banh mi and the banh cuon with can of the lychee fruit drink to wash it down. My coworkers also got drinks and a banh mi and our bill was still only $12. A Vietnamese friend told me if I ever paid over $10 for 3 banh mi, I was getting screwed - first test passed, Banh Cuon.My sandwich was loaded with dark meat chicken (hooray for flavor!) and the pickled carrots and creamy pate made for an awesome flavor profile. My only complaint about the sandwich was that they were light on the fresh jalapeno.The banh cuon was as good as I've had anywhere else. Great earthy flavor that didn't even need the dipping sauce it was accompanied with - just a little bit of sriracha for my personal taste. Banh Cuon was a great kickoff to what ended up being a fun-filled foodie work week in Seattle! Update on things to/not to get:To get!Be Thui (charred veal) Bo la lot (grilled wrapped beef thingamabobbers)xoi ga (stick rice with chicken)Banh mibanh uotbanh hoiDon't get!Fried ricethose fried shrimp thingysCha (vietnamese pork ham)Spring rollsBanh uot xao (also called ap chao or fried chow fun I think) You will miss this place if your not looking for it. But you won't miss it if you did.Average Vietnamese deli. There are about 6 within a half mile vicinity.I don't know if this place sets itself apart enough to make it worth visiting. The people are real nice, and the sammys are good.If you need a Vietnamese treat and no one else is open, you can come here. Great place for Banh Cuon and Banh Uot (which is kinda like a rice tortilla either stuffed with meats and veggies or just left by itself with meat and veggies on the side). Not the best I've had but definitely the best I've had in Seattle. Be Thui looks good, so I'm gonna try that some day. They also sell Bi (shredded pork) which I haven't found for sale in other delis in Seattle. Food's pretty good and would recommend going here over Saigon Deli any time. Excellent frozen won-tons and frozen spring rolls to cook at home! This place is so obscure that I was surprised to see folks already reviewing it. This in one of my favorite places to explore food in the International District. &#160;Most of the folks who have reviewed are talking about their Bahn Mi and Spring Rolls but those can be gotten elsewhere and indeed better elsewhere too. &#160;This place is all about exotic foods and things I cannot pronounce the names of. &#160;Sure their hot food is tasty but I enjoy their prepacked lunches. &#160;They have several types of spiced Vietnamese sausages, interesting greens, rice based noodle types and tasty sauces. &#160;This is one of the places in the ID that uses an amount of fish sauce that really works for me. &#160;Another reason to like it is that the guy who is usually working the cash register is both patient and speaks excellent English. &#160;It makes it easier for me to ask questions and get educated. &#160;Some of my friends get a bit nervous seeing how much of it is not refrigerated but I think that is a bit of white person paranoia. &#160;Much of the rest of the word doesn't refrigerate as much as we do. &#160;Whenever I am nearby I stop in and point to something that looks tasty and unknown and then just try it. &#160;You can do that with confidence because everything is so cheap if you don't like it you can toss it. &#160;That is how I got turned on to their incredible corn rolls stuffed with items like shrimp or mung beans. &#160;Fried oily heaven.
I wanted to like the Vietnamese sandwiches here. &#160;It's my first time visiting Seattle, and I was impressed how thoroughly Vietnamese the neighborhood is, after a Chinatown that looked seriously corny and seemed to offer lots of "Chop Suey." &#160;And the restaurant not only didn't have English signs, but the lady behind the counter didn't speak English, so I guess it's all very authentic. &#160;I don't speak Vietnamese, but language really wasn't a problem - most of the food is available to see and be pointed at, and she understood "sandwich" and "BBQ pork." &#160;There was a nice couple that helped translate the price of a couple other items.However, the sandwich ended up being merely OK. &#160;The bread was nothing special, there were really only a few strands of vegetables added on, and I got the small bits of pieces of the BBQt pork, with too much skin, rather than the pieces with any real meat. &#160;There also wasn't much spread, and all in all it was too dry. &#160;I can't say it was a bad sandwich, but I'm 100% sure there's better Vietnamese sandwiches in the immediate area.
Maria is fantastic and her food is just as fine.Best news for a gringo like me? She speaks perfect English and when I ask for 'no onions' or whatever other weirdness I need to feed, she hooks me up right.Pupusas are a delight, tacos are fantastic and the quesadilla with rice and beans is really a hit with the under 5 crowd. This taco truck is pretty cool. &#160;It's a bit different than others in the area due to the owner being from El Salvador, but that also means that you can order excellent pupusas with your tacos. &#160;I would go so far as to say that this is the best pupusa I've had in the area, besting both El Comal and Guanaco's. The outside was crispy and the filling was more complex than I've experienced elsewhere (not just a mess of pork and beans). &#160;The tacos were not quite as exciting, but still satisfying - al pastor was okay, but lengua was pretty good. &#160;A bonus is that my plate also included grilled onions, curtido, radishes, pickled carrots, and a big slice of jalape&#241;o. That's a lot of food for $4.50.Two trains passed by while my order was being prepared, which is a lot of waiting for a taco truck. &#160;Service is probably faster during busier times when the owner doesn't have to come out of her house and walk to the truck before taking an order.If you can't decide between a pupusa and a taco, just go to Tacos Maria/Patzcuaro and get both. I had the pupusas for lunch today. It wasn't as quick as the other dishes, but that's because I ordered the pupusas with little cheese. However, when they were finished 20 minutes later, they were fresh and hot. I got two pupusas, and they came with a small side of coleslaw. Maria also gave me a red hot sauce to eat with them; the sauce was tangy and flavorful, and not too hot. Added a good flair to the already outstanding food. I also found it relaxing to sit under the umbrellas, at a table, and watch the Light Rail go by while eating my food. I've been going to Maria's Taco truck for many years now and she never fails to provide the best Spanish dishes I've ever eaten! She's very friendly and her prices are very reasonable!! I recommend anything on her menu!! My favorite is the Chicken Torta!!
This business was added in Yelp as 'Beacon Bar B Que' before I added a tip a while back: I wonder if the business name can be updated to 'Beacon BBQ"?My guess is that you've driven by this place on Beacon Ave and dismissed it. It's really easy to! I walk to Jefferson Park and pass by this place regularly. I'm not sure if they provide dim sum to other restaurants, or if it is strictly for regular retail customers. They have a big rolling steam table standing by the deli case filled with a little or a lot of variety of dim sum. Complete feast or famine thing. The shrimp dumplings are giant happy to-go pillows. They're so good, I don't even use the sauce. The real draw here is the BBQ duck here. Reasonably priced and just as good as King's. (The sauce is a bit salty, drizzle at your own risk.) I do love it when people chop up my meat in front of me--it makes for an authentic experience. In their deli case, they also have fried fat back, vegetables, rice balls, noodles and fresh BBQ pork--and though I look at the case every time, I never see anything in it that has ever made me want to try it. Also, they are really good about upselling you on their goods, but the BBQ duck and chicken are usually enough for me :) I dunno though...Is this place a front for something else? They've been here as long as I've lived on the hill. Help me figure it out!
Another dive bar to add to the list of dive bars that I've gone to in Seattle.Came here on a whim to meet up with a friend, have a few bourbons and discuss what's been going on in our crazy lives.Cheap price for bourbon, but not cheap brands. &#160;If you want a water chaser though, there's a jug placed opposite the bar to serve yourself. A couple of pool tables and good service (although we had to go to the bar to get our drinks). &#160;Plenty of room and comfortable / laid back setting. &#160;Not a bad place to knock back a few and take a breather from life if you are in the First Hill area.Oh and Tuesday night is Trivia night, so unless you are going to play or don't mind speaking over the guy on the microphone (or answering who you are to the whole crowd over the microphone), I wouldn't suggest going on a Tuesday night until it was a bit later. I come here a couple times a year specifically so I can have Kona Pipeline Porter on tap. If you haven't tried it, you absolutely MUST. It's one of only a couple bars in Seattle that I know of that serve the stuff, and it's my absolute favorite beer....the best things about beer combined with the best things about coffee. You'd think the coffee aftertaste would get old, but it really, really doesn't. I mean, I love this beer so much, I literally bring back multiple six packs of it every time I go to Portland or Bellingham, because I can't find it at any local grocery stores. But anyway, on to my review of Quarters....Other than the beer, this place doesn't have a TON going for it. It's quiet enough to talk to your friends, the music is usually pretty good, there's usually not a line for the pool tables (although one of them is pretty rickety and doesn't always give you all your balls back). The pool tables cost a full dollar, instead of fifty cents, which is kind of a bummer. The atmosphere is kind of cute; I particularly like the bathrooms (they're surprisingly classy) and the fake pearls that are strung from the chandeliers. Oh, and they have one happy hour every day, and a late night happy hour every day but Friday and Saturday. They also usually have a special of the night, like whisky &amp; coke for $3, not that I would ever consider buying anything other than the Pipeline Porter here... This is your average dive bar... not much to write home about here. I got a gin and grapefruit juice and supped it happily with my friend at the bar. The overall volume was very loud and we had a hard time hearing each other over the raucus.The bar tender was nice and helped me pick out a good drink for my wants. But truth be told he was a little boring, ie he never really did check on us and just kind of wandered around getting other patrons drinks. We were ready to cash out quite a while before he got back to us to take our money... you'd think he'd be a little more anxious for htat.They have pool tables and dart boards and they are overall kind of a basicly good dive bar. Sleezy, old-school &#160;Seattle hangout. &#160;Wear your gloves with the fingers cut off and a severely wrinkled flannel. Juke box, pool table, cool bar tenders and an awesome sign out front. What could go wrong? This is such a great dive bar to check out. I am a fan of their daily specials, ability to create drinks on the fly, and of course their bartenders personalities. Great prices and great place to meet before going out and/or great place to just hang out and grab a drink. Fun neighborhood joint. I live down the street so it's super convenient. Nothing too special here but I love the crowd and the drinks are the right price for sure. Ultimately, it's a great place to start your night. They have a pretty awesome electronic jukebox, too.
My Piroshky has a first name, it's NOM NOM NOM, NOM NOM!My Piroshky has a second second name, it's NOM NOM, OMFG NOM, NOM...Oh, I love to eat it every day, and if you ask me why, I'll saaaayyyy, NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM, and NOM NOM NOM!!! A long line snakes out the door to get one of the piroshkys at Piroshky Piroshky. We chose a Potato Mushroom Onion piroshky, which the husband termed the PMO. He dared me to call it that when I ordered, just as he has similarly dared me to order "the most expensive dessert on the menu" at Gameworks and at California Pizza Kitchen to order the "ginger dumps". So when I ordered, I had to say, "I'll have the PMO."And I did it and they actually knew what I was referring to. Score 1 for me.Our piroshky was warm and we ate it at the park nearby. We were really tempted by the apple cinnamon roll in the window of Piroshky Piroshky but we ended up passing on it in favor of crumpets and chocolate croissants at other places nearby. I took some out of town visitors to the market, like you do, and I just had to force feed them piroshkys. Ok force was not needed as the smell of the freshly baked pastries wafting out into the street was enough of a draw, but still, I explained that they are a must try.I think i gained 2 pounds just by walking in the door.My friends were floored. One got the Apple cinnamon, the other the rosemary chicken. Both incredible. I have had the salmon pate piroshky in the past and completely adored it. I told them that since they are on vacation these delicacies are calorie free, and they thanked me for that bit of information. It's touristy. &#160;You'll bound to find a long line. &#160;And some of the lesser menu items aren't all that great. &#160;But every time I visit Seattle, Piroshky Piroshky is a dive that I have to visit.I recommend trying a few of the favorites before getting adventurous. &#160;We tried the chicken mushroom and rice piroshky, but it was dry and didn't taste that great. &#160;The beef and onion, on the other hand, was delicious.We also took a few sweet ones to go, the cranberry apple roll was clutch for our road trip to Vancouver the next day. &#160;I don't know how the locals feel about this place, but if you're visiting the area, give Piroshky Piroshky a try. &#160;You won't regret it. Delicious. As with a lot of stores at Pike Place, your only regret is that you wish you'd have a bigger stomach to take down all that good food. I saw a line of about 10 people going into the street and so I realized I've come to the right place. Foreshadow (aka spoiler alert): Long lines usually mean something good is brewing in the midst. I ordered the potato, onion, and cheese version. Very tasty. I was walking around Pike Place eating it, constantly looking down at my delicious delight, running into people. The delights (if you can't tell by now, I have no idea what the hell to call them) are around $4-$5. A little pricey for something that doesn't fill you up but definitely worth it. When I come back to Pike Place (it's guaranteed), I will be back at Piroshky. Nice, friendly employees, evening taking time to actually explain her recommendation rather than the disgruntled folks at Cinnamon Works. Yumm.. Me and wifey didn't want to sit down and eat somewhere.. (we would of wasted precious minutes during our 24hr field trip!!haha). A Piroshky was perfect. &#160;The beef and cheese piroshky was a perfect meal.. The crust was soft and chewy, but not greasy.. And the beef and cheese filling was perfectly warm, &#160;and savory.. Makes my mouth water thinkin bout it.. Good pick Geneva!!! First tasted this on our Savor Seattle tour (tried the garlic and cheese and the salmon pate) both melt in your mouth good. I wish I could say that they have 0 calories, but by the smell of it you know that there is a reason why you walk in Seattle. My bf and I ended up going back a second time and I tried the mushroom, smoked mozzarella and onion one (not bad, but not nearly as good as the first two I tried) I wanted to try the cinnamon apple one, but my poor tummy couldn't take anymore carbs that day. boo hoo. must visit again!! Anthony Bourdain won't lead you astray. &#160;Piroshky Piroshky is pretty darn good, good. &#160;Perfect piroshkies and a huge selection. &#160;The hardest thing to do is pick which one's you want to try. &#160;No, wait, that's easy. &#160;EVERYTHING IS PRETTY DARN GOOD. &#160;I tried the beef and onion - phenomenal as in the I can't wait to get to the car before I finish this phenomenal. &#160;The smoked salmon was tasty. &#160;I guess if I had to knock one of them, it'd be the chicken and rice. &#160;It's a little bland, but I guess that's the penalty for being the healthiest option in there.Oh, I know what's the hardest thing. &#160;How the h*ll do you say piroshky? After 100 reviews for the same place, what's left to be said? Piroshkies are essentially savory or sweet pastry things with exposed fillings. They're delicious, filling and beautiful. For some people used to American sized portions a piroshky isn't going to stuff you like you expect a $10 to do. But that's ok because if you eat them long and slow on a brisk fall day in the nearby park you'll feel quite satisfied. Everyone has favorites, but I prefer getting a different one every time I go. This means I get the great taste and a lot of pleasant surprises. Sauerkraut in a savory pastry? Nom nom nom!The lines are long but very fast. Have your order and money ready so you don't bring shame to your family. Also, have backup choices since they run out of things. They have no seating but there are public areas near by. Stopped by here to get some Piroshky for a small gathering of friends!The service was pleasant and quick, and he let me know if something is right out of the oven and not yet out in the display case.and that's geat cuz hotter the piroshky the better! Great piroshky joint. So much variety and so good. Everything is fresh. If you're in the area, be sure to stop by.JONASAPPROVED! I'm so jealous that this place is only in Seattle. This place was fabulous. Yummy sweet and savory piroshkies baked fresh and ready to go. I had the beef and onion, which was delish, but was even more mesmerized by the beef and cheese. Now that was heaven on earth!We even bought some to bring for our car ride to Portland that afternoon and some for our friends who also highly recommended this place. I'm filipino, if I opened up a piroshky place in San Jose, Ca, do you think I could pass for a russian? HahahahahahI will come back to Seattle just for this! 4 stars for the smoked salmon piroshky. I tried the beef and onion piroskhy which wasn't that great. My SO didn't like the chicken, mushroom, and rice one either. They do a Piroshky &amp; Borscht soup lunch combo, but the soup is a really small serving.Insist they warm up your piroshky if it's been sitting for a while. I took a bite out of my mushroom piroshky and all I could think of was one phrase. FOR SERIOUS?? (coined by a childhood friend back in elementary school, ahem. teresa.)This place is majorly o-v-e-r-r-a-t-e-d. Doughy? Yes. Tasty? Blah.Sorry. And it's such a catchy name too!! I couldn't stop saying it for days and days. Piroshky piroshky. Yeah I'll have a Cinnamon Dolce Latte, extra hot. Piroshky. Man I'm hungry, what time is it? Piroshky Piroshky.I wanted so much to love this place. Or at least as much as I loved saying its name. I loves me some pirsoshky's and this is a great place to get them (assuming you're not mobbed by the tourists surrounding you at the Market). All the fillings are excellent and the dough/wrapper is always tasty (flaky and doughy, not crunchy or extra thick) . Sometimes it's served up a little too hot and you have to wait a while to bite in, but it's a small price to pay for the experience. Only took of a star because I can't bring myself to say it's "as good as it gets". Oh, and if this review # (107) were my temperature, I'd be dead. Positively Perfect Puffy Pike Place Piroshky ! A little shop you can't miss with the fresh scent of fresh baked goodies! Complete with savory &amp; sweet, I decided to go for the Chicken &amp; Rice Piroshky. Which ended up being flaky &amp; full of yumminess! There was a lot more filling than I expected, and quite satisfying for a small snack. The shop is small with an expected long line, but they are pretty quick about serving you. Since it's a small snuggley spot, there is really no place to sit and eat, so make sure you're ready to take it to go or eat while strolling around the market. Mmmm I could go for one now...I can't wait to return! :) Wooh, the counter guy was a cutie! What a great attitude.For $6.50 I got a piroshky and a cup of borsht. &#160;You can get sour cream in it but I opted for pure borsht. &#160;Which surprisingly was made with a bit of zuchinni besides the standard beets.I opted to get the sauerkraut, carrot, onion and cabbage piroshky. It was all very filling (of course, I did just eat a crumpet and half a serving of mac and cheese elsewhere in Pike's Place Market). The piroshky was definitely good though a bit heavy on the caraway seed. &#160;I'm not super fond of that type of flavor but it worked. &#160;I didn't taste much onion or cabbage though.We sat at the counter which had a snazzy poster of various articles and praise for the tiny shop.They also sell a lot of sweet pastries. &#160;And you can watch an old Russian woman rolling out the dough.Oh! And the owner wrote a book called Piroshky. &#160;I assume it was on sale at the shop though I didn't even touch the display model. &#160;I rather just have some bake me a cheap pastry (only $3.50). What a Russian treat! &#160;How can you resist the Piroshky's being so carefully made in the front window. &#160;It's impossible. &#160;I wasn't even hungry. &#160;You just have to do it. &#160;I had the Beef and Onion Piroshky which was light, greasy, flaky, and stuffed with goodness.Although I'm told the potato Piroshky is the way to go. &#160;This is a must treat. &#160;Everyone put your Ushanka hat on and break out your matryoshkas...because this can't be missed! It took me no less than an hour after touching down in Seattle to head straight to this place. Despite it being heavily recommended by fellow Seattle Yelpers, I must admit the reason for my gastrointestinal anxiety was mainly from wondering: "What the hell is a piroshky?" Of course amidst this kind of curiosity, one hits up Google and finds that 1) Piroshsky Piroshky (or, Piroshky squared?) is in at least the first ten listings of any conversation on the topic and, more importantly 2) a piroshky is bread/pastry stuffed with [enter culinary exquisiteness here]. Well heck, why didn't ya say so earlier?As you enter Pike Place you can probably smell these puppies two blocks away - the only thing that takes over is the cinnamon place down the way, which then gets mixed in with pungent fish odor. Follow the cheese and garlic to safety! The other sign of success is the consistent line outside. Oh, and that gorgeous window display....drooooooool.... I went for the Cheese, Garlic and Green Onion while my sausage-connosieur friend (which might sound so wrong, but I assure you I'm talking pigs and cows here) went for the Bavarian Sausage. Mine might have been the size of my head but as you can't go wrong with melted cheese and garlic, I gobbled it down in potentially 3 minutes flat. The sausage roll was a nicely little packed meat pocket (uh... okay no comment this time) and while it was good, my friend commented that the "Bavarian Sausage" tasted like not much more than a simple hot dog. Perhaps like a large "pig in a russian blanket"?My only regret is not returning later for a dessert Piroshky, but as I currently hunt down every Russian bakery in Los Angeles, I have to admit I'll have this place on the brain until I return to Seattle. I've never had a Russian pastry before now! &#160;I was watching the one lone lady rolling the pastries and she was so quick with her hands! &#160;The salmon pate piroshky ($4.50) is a MUST TRY here. &#160;It's basically a salmon mix inside a croissant-like bread. &#160;For a more traditional Russian piroshky try their beef and onion piroshky. Piroshky Piroshky actually defines a "piroshky" as a stuffed pie with a variety of fillings. &#160;They offer both meat and vegetarian piroshkys here. &#160;Great grab and go place for a quick afternoon bite to eat. Crispy, flaky deliciousness -- seems like the sweet are better than the savory. &#160;I had the cranberry apple and was quite pleased. &#160;You can stroll over to the park area and enjoy your pastry whilst looking over the Sound.Minus one star for the hopping children rubbing their grubby little fingers all over the glass cases. &#160;Stand back, brats. &#160;Nothing comes between me and my carbs. I know this place doesn't need another review, but I saw some douchebag give them a 3, so here I am to bump up their average.Without a doubt, the Sour Kraut Peroshky (Piroshki) is one of the most delicious things I've ever tasted. &#160;It's like creamin' your jeans good.It stays good in the fridge for at least a whole day &amp; when heated in the oven, returns to the same beautiful texture &amp; taste as the second the batch first came out of the oven down at the shop.Like many others, my hubby loves the Rosemary, Chicken, &amp; Rice Peroshky. &#160;We both agree on the Moscow Roll. &#160;A sweet &amp; creamy, but not too sweet nor creamy, blend of Bavarian Creme &amp; Creme of Wheat. &#160;Sounds odd, I know, but TRUST!!!Also have tried the Rhubarb (way too sweet, not tart at all), the Chocolate Creme w/ Hazlenut (Nutella rolled in a pastry, I wasn't impressed), the Marzipan Roll (the most sickening-sweet Marzipan I've ever had) &amp; the Cheese Roll w/ Green Onions (bland, I prefer jalepenos to onions &amp; slightly greasy, but it is cheese after all). Mmmm.... Americanized Russian food. &#160;Not bad, but not earth shattering either.Finally decided to give this place a try and it was OK. &#160;A bit on the greasy side. &#160;But, it was good enough and it definitely wasn't bad snacking food for when you are making your way through the market. &#160;However, everyone Russian I know thinks this stuff sucks. &#160;Or, as my buddy put it "that stuff's not worth 50 cents much less 4 bucks. &#160;I have to take their word for it. &#160; Thus, this place is fine if you want a snack or even a quick meal while walking around the market. &#160;Just keep going if you are looking for authentic Russian food (or so I have heard). If you didn't like or know what a piroshky was before, you will after you visit this bakery. &#160;That's what happened when i visited Piroshky Piroshky.Who'd of known piroshkys are very delicious? &#160;Piroshky Piroshky has savory and sweet piroshkys and an excellent variety to choose from. savory SALMON PATTE piroshky- delicious. it's not heavy. the flavor is very light. THIS Was my favorite.sweet CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT piroshky- also delicious. not as chocolate-y as I expected, but as with the others, its a light flavor and does not overwhelm you.savory CHEESE and onion piroshky- good, but not as much taste as the others. I would not purchase this one again.WORTH THE VISIT. WAS NOT EXPENSIVE ($3-4/piroshky)RIGHT IN THE HEART OF PIKE'S PLACE (well, across the street)PLACE LOOKS VERY CLEAN UNGH. *DROOLS*just WALKING BY THIS PLACE makes you wanna smack your face in the window and eat their displays.SERIOUSLY! although I'm allergic to fruits, and therefore can't eat their apple cinnamon roll amazing goodness they have (that EVERYONE reccomends) let's just get right down to it, anything you get there is going to be GOOEY, HOT, and amazingly TASTY.The line is long for a reason, and their food really proves it. It's small, it's cramped, and you feel like you're going to have an anxiety attack since everyone's moving around so quickly and you have to practically scream out what you want, BUT............ once you take that first bite you're going to fall in love. There are few places i give a 5 star review but this is one. This is the place my girlfriend and I will crave when arriving home, we have come from the airport and decided on the way home, man some piroshky piroshky sounds good right now. We will take the exit and battle the redonkulous traffic just to park and walk our way to this joint.Great sweet or savory pastries... especially the savory filled (rice and chicken i think it is?) The Russians know how to do it right. A yeasty bread dough enveloping a hunk of potato with cheese? Yes, please.When a potato-cheese-onion piroshky meets some plain old American mustard, it's over. This was by far my favorite-- a still-lumpy mash of potato with veins of cheddar cheese running throughout the mixture, chopped onion providing some sweetness and savory, all blanketed by an eggy dough baked to a golden sheen, topped off with a loving smattering of dill. I even took one home to Berkeley and microwaved it when I got back.Tourists may be a pain in the butt for PPM regulars, but you can sure credit them for perpetuating the constant freshness of these puppies all day long. When I came on a Sunday, the racks were stacked with freshly baked pastries, and indeed ours were piping hot. Tuesday-- not so much. Not only was there no pesky line, the piroshky was cold and a bit plain (the microwave back home did the trick).I'm sorely regretting not having tried the sauerkraut piroshky and all of the dessert items. I will definitely be coming back on my next trip to Seattle. Our faces were slapped with a seductive aroma of yumminess as we walked by this Seattle gem. Looking at their sign, we said, "What the heck is a 'piroshky'?" We jumped in line to find out: $35 and a plethora of piroshkies later, we discovered the secret - flaky, warm bread encasing mushrooms, potatoes, spinach, onions, smoked salmon, apples, cinnamon, whatever you like. Our favorites were the Potato Mushroom &amp; Onion, Spinach Egg &amp; Cheese and Smoked Salmon Pate. A Pike Place must-see!(Could there be any more Cali folk reviewing this place?) I'd even brave the tourists on my lunch hour to visit Piroshky Piroshky! &#160;That's saying a lot since I have an aversion to such creatures. &#160;The line outside the door looks ominous but usually moves quickly, and many of those people are just ogling tourists that aren't planning on buying anything anyway.The sauerkraut &amp; carrot piroshky is definitely the lunchtime where-it's-at. &#160;Although beware the small seeds (flax? &#160;fennel?) that hide within. &#160;Make sure you have a spotter or a mirror to check yo-self before you become that person with seeds in your teeth.A small lunch will cost you under $5 for one piroshky. &#160;Eye the sweet decadence of their pastries and you might walk out of there having spent closer to $8. &#160;All in all, a carb-o-licious lunch of piroshky for under $10 sounds like a good way to spend the lunch hour. The Pike marketplace in general has an amazing selection of goods...top notch, fresh, seasonal items to serve the discriminating tastes of their clientele. Piroshky Piroshky then, fits right into the mix, serving both savory and sweet items with that homemade goodness you have to experience to believe. I haven't been to Seattle in ages, and I'm still thinking of that delicious warm apple cinnamon roll...and I am far too bitter to have a sweet tooth! ;)Must try while at the Marketplace...save room among all the cheese, seafood, coffee, and fresh produce, you'll need the power snack - be it salty or sweet! This place is sooo good.. Everything looked and smelled amazing so I had a hard time choosing what to order.The line was long, but it moved pretty fast. The wait probably lasted about 10 minutes.I decided on a chicken and rice with wine sauce piroshky along with an apple cinnamon roll.The piroshky was a little too salty for me.. make sure you at least get a water with the savory items!The apple cinnamon roll was very good and not too sweet. The apples, cinnamon, and dough were all warm and fresh tasting. You can even watch the ladies making the dough in front of you.A real Seattle treat.+ huge variety of items+ reasonable prices+ very fresh Before trying Piroshky Piroshky, I hadn't eaten it in forever. My friend and I decided to drive up from Portland to walk around Seattle and a coworker of mine suggested I go to Pike Place Market.There was a long line so I thought, "Hmm....must be good!" So we stood in line and the smell reminded me of Noah's Bagels. Didn't look like the normal piroshky's I've eaten before but I decided to get the Beef and Cheese one. My best friend got the salmon one...which was shaped like a fish. hehe....They had this great deal of any piroshky and borsch soup....how could I pass that up? Their borsch was ok...it was the first time I had tried it with sour cream. But the piroshky was delicious! I wish they had one here in San Francisco. =( I'd really give this a 3.5, but alas the yelp rating system doth deny me.Honestly, if this place weren't just surrounded by so many other incredible places it would probably easily be a 4. Maybe I'm not being fair, but I'm stingy in my ratings. I've only stopped by a couple of times, and I've gotten good food for a good price with great service each time. I certainly encourage anyone who hasn't been to stop by. I will be going back as well. Next time I stop by, I'll try a few suggestions from you fellow yelpers and this might end up getting bumped up to a 4 star. Stay tuned. we should've stopped in before we stepped into the main arcade at PPM... we would've been able to eat more.bf and i shared the potato, onion and mushroom piroshky... i really wanted to try a sweet one, but he was itching for savory, but DANG it was SOOOOO good, even though we were full off all the other foods we stuffed in our mouths.it was hot, fresh, savory..... BEST balance of fillings to pie. i've never had a piroshky before, but am so glad i found this place on yelp and had a chance to check it out!!!!! What people dont seem to understand, is there is no such thing as "authentic" russian unless you decide to visit Moscow. And every single displaced slavic citizen thinks that their family makes the best. The owners are russian grandmothers, and they hand make these every day. Ive had so many varieties of piroshky, pelemini or pierogies that i am convinced that there is not one true authentic recipe out there for the little "festival dumpling". Every area of poland, russia, and ukraine have a little different variety. The ones you get at state fairs are DEFINATELY not authentic to the least, though. :-) Piroshky Piroshky has been around for at least 10 years... I know, because I used to go here when I was in treatment at Fred Hutch. As a cancer patient, I wasn't allowed to eat out unless the food was FRESH out of the oven. The people at Piroshky Piroshky were wonderful, and some of my fondest memories from Seattle involve Cheese, Onion, and Garlic piroshkies. :-) what a delicately delicious piece of food. &#160;Too many to choose from, but I opted for ham, cheese, and spinach. &#160;it was a warm and healthy breakfast. oh my god yes!!!beef and onion in a flaky crust?don't mind if i do.the best part of dating a vegan?i don't have to share.BBWWAAHHAAAAAAHAHAHAwe need one of these places in portland. This place is YUMMY. &#160;I had the pleasure of having the potato, cheese and onion piroshky....it was soft and full of flavor. &#160;I'm so glad I made a stop at this place. &#160;The thing was big so I saved half for my husband. &#160;Although he ate it a few hours later in LA, he still liked it. &#160;I will definitely come back here again &#160;whenever my next visit to Seattle will be. This place made us discuss moving to Seattle, just to be a little closer to heaven. &#160;Seriously, if we had the ability to try every single item in the restaurant in two days, we would have. &#160;Instead we had to settle for 4 (which was painful but worth it!). &#160;After our first shared beef Piroshky followed by a shared apple-cinnamon roll, we decided we had to go back the next day for more. &#160;Seriously, if you are in a 3 hour radius of Seattle, go to Piroshky, Piroshky right now! how can you not love this place. freshly warm, buttery flaky, and greasy beef Piroshky with a cup of borscht (Russian minestrone) for 7 bucks. Service = simple and fast, accomdate most of my question w/o being annoyed, &#160;+1Ambiance = two stool, does that count? &#160;quick and easyFood = concept of piroshky is taking leftovers from the day before and making a bun or roll for the next day. &#160;so yes I love the idea and totally related to this. &#160;This mom use to do this with rice, and convert to fried rice! &#160;Price = $ &#160;wowFavorite = everything pike placeWorst = hard to park just to come here:(Final Say = I love it! Another Sea-town landmark on Pike right next to the market. &#160;As you can surmise from the many other glowing reviews they serve up some damn fine pastries within these confines. &#160;I highly recommend both the chicken/mushroom/rice and salmon pate piroshky. &#160;There's always a line extending out the door as this place seems to have quite the reputation. &#160;If you're from the town you already know the deal, but if you're visiting definitely give it a try when you check out the market. Its been a month since I visited here and the memory of the piroshkis still haunt me (in a good way, of course). &#160;While we were at Pike Place Market, it became imperative that we stop here and have a taste of these famous goodies, if only because of the delicious aroma emanating from this small store.It helped that they had a list of their most ordered piroshkis because it can be quite difficult to choose from their large selection, especially when there's a long line of hungry tourists behind you trying to get to the counter. &#160;Luckily, the women there kept their cool, allowed us a few moments grace, and didn't go "Soup Nazi" on us while we contemplated our choices. &#160;We choose 4- the beef and cheese, the potato, onion and mushroom, the cheese onion garlic roll, and the chocolate cream hazelnut roll. &#160;Granted two of these choices weren't particularly traditional, but they were awesomely tasty. &#160;My absolute favorite of the bunch was probably the cheese onion garlic roll- the onion and garlic were mouthwateringly fragrant and the cheese is thick and salty- a perfect counterpoint to the somewhat sweet dough of the roll. &#160;The others were tasty as well, but for me, the cheese onion garlic roll was magical.Piroshky Piroshky was definitely worth the trip up- I'd be back in a heartback any time I'm back in the Seattle area! So many choices, so little time. I wish I could enter a Piroshky eating contest and come out victorious, but then again I wouldn't want particles of meat filled Russian pastries coming out of my nostrils, desperately trying not to have a "reversal of fortune." Plus, I wouldn't be able to enjoy each and every Piroshky. We had a sample during the Savor Seattle tour, but came back to try the potato, mushroom, and onion. Very tasty, and a definite meal in itself. I just wouldn't want to know how many calories are in each one. Something that smells that good, can't be good for you, can it? Believe the hype! &#160;If you ever venture around Pike Place market I highly recommend dropping into this little bakery to try their piroshkys. &#160;mmmm...mmm...mm. &#160;Must trys are their savory Salmon Pate and the Beef and Cheese. &#160;The beef and onion piroshky was okay, but no where as delicious as the other two. &#160;I still crave these in the mornings. &#160;Thank god this place is thousands of miles away or else I'd be there every morning. I get it! I totally get why their line spills out the door onto the sidewalk. At first I didn't get it. I thought, what are those fools doing? I snuck a peek at their pastry filled window--whatever, I thought. The next day my friends were raving about Piroskhy! Piroshky! Okay, so I ditched them to brunch with a local, but I didn't know my vacation buddies were going to get sucked into what a considered a pasty tourist trap. They raved, they shouted Piroskhy! Piroshky! to the high heavens. I still wasn't convinced. I wasn't convinced, until, until the morning I was handed a white chocolate cherry pastry for breakfast: Oh. My. Russian. God. Piroskhy! Piroshky!, I shouted! Hours later we hit Piroshky! Piroshky! for lunch. I ordered a ham, spinach, cheese (heartattack) pocket. The crust was of a flakier and greaser variety than my morning pocket, which still stated alright, but couldn't compare to my morning puff--I'll know better for next time.Leaving Seattle, leaving Piroshky! Piroshky!, was bitter sweet, because while I love my Russian hot pockets, that fatty gooey temptation eventually would have been the death of me. This is a great place to grab something quick (as long as there's not a huge line stretching out into the road) as you're wandering through Pike Place. For what it's worth, the salmon piroshky is my favorite choice, but it's pretty hard to go wrong. They also have some very good dessert eats too, but it's difficult to pass up a piroshky. It's also family owned so that's a nice added bonus of eating at the best piroshky place in town. Great lunch special. &#160;These are different then the ones my mother used to make, but they're good. &#160;I can see why this place is so popular. First time trying it. I didn't really know what to get so we asked what they recommended. Overall it was decent, but not to die for in terms of flavor. They have tons of piroshkis, but they aren't really so authentic. It's good if you want to try a lot of different flavors. my savory and sweet tooths battle it out while i wait in line at piroshky piroshky. savory wins every time though. mix my 3 loves :garlic, cheese, and carbs together to make a palm sized treat and &#160;there you have it.i have noticed that the ladies behind the counter are very rude when the shop is busy and very kind when it is slow. for some reason it makes me like them more...... This is the one place downtown I am happy to return and bare the tourists.. so many amazing piroshkys to choose from! Quick, served to go wonderfully hot and tasty perfectly filling and well worth the price. Some of my favorites are the cheddar cheese roll, the strawberry rhubarb, the oscar's star, and the smoked mozzarella and mushroom/broccoli. Yummy salmon piroshky for lunch, potato onion &amp;cheese for my flight tonight and cherry &amp; white chocolate for in between! Got there at 12:15 pm and no line! Yay! I visited Seattle the past weekend and one of my friends told me that I HAVE to check this place out. So glad I did... cause their beef and cheese piroshky was to die for! DELICOUS!!!! if i knew it was that good i would've bought 5!! &#160;very nice delight! OK, My wife and I are walking through Pike's after a mile walk from out hotel the Silver Cloud on Broadway, we were famished. &#160;Now I have never been to Seattle before but I have herd from many that we have to stop by Piroshky Piroshky. &#160;As a Pike's virgin I contiued to wander in the quest for seafood, beer, fresh produce, and Piroshky Piroshky's (beer and seafood on my other seattle postings). &#160;When we finally arrived at Pikes I never expected that the market would be layered out the way it was (in reality it was a multi-tiered collections of covered sidewalks instead of the large floor of an airplane hanger like buildings with many vendors strune about in a grid like woven cluster of crafts and produce like I have always imagined). &#160;Oh well, walking about the maze of vendors of crafts, produce and restaurants we finally walked passed the infamous Piroshky Piroshky. &#160;It was about noon and there it was in all its glory. &#160;My wife and I proceeded to the counter and ordered; for me Smoked Mozzarella, Broccoli, and Mushroom Piroshky, my wife ordered a Ham, Spinach, and Cheese Piroshky. &#160;I would have to say that I preferred the ham spinach and Cheese due to it's flaky crust. &#160;The bready casing of the Smoked Mozzarella, Broccoli, and Mushroom Piroshky was kinda' of a miss match of textures (lack of the juxtaposition of textures). &#160;I will definitely go there again at the end of the week to sample another offering. &#160;As for now I'd have to say that Piroshky Piroshky is a destination not to be missed. Baked perfection for the carb fanatics. Do not miss this place if this describes YOU. I'm still dreaming of the delicious Beef and Cheese piroshky I had during my 2 night stand with the city of Seattle. Oh Piroshky, lets run away and get married. I'll build you a beautiful house complete with a white picket fence and a heatlamp to keep you warm and tasty...er toasty. My favorite item here is the salmon piroshky. It comes in a pastry that is shaped like a fish. The filling is a smoked salmon creamy bit of yum. Wonderful to eat on the go or to make it your destination. Ideal portion size to refuel while at Pike Place without spoiling your dinner. If you don't feel like going to an expensive sit-down place for lunch when down by Pike Place, this is a wonderful and delicious alternative. In fact, it won't even seem like an alternative. There is not a place like this in Northern California! &#160;So right as I walked out of the original Starbucks, I was immediately drawn in by the smell of good food and my friends quickly followed suit. &#160;They have a variety of baked goods for all, but I went for the smoke salmon pate piroshky (shaped like a fish) and marzipan roll. &#160;To my delight, I was extremely satisfied and I spent less than $10. &#160;My only regret is not buying some treats to take home. Love you Piroshky Piroshky! &#160;Had the smoke salmon pate and meat &amp; cheese piroshky. &#160;Soooooo yummy. &#160;So fresh, delicious and so tasty. &#160;I have nothing but good things to say. &#160;I can't wait to try other items from the menu. &#160;This will definitely be a must-see and must-eat each time I head to Seattle. This is a tiny place filled with good eats. &#160;I tried the piroshky with sauerkraut. &#160;It was delicious. &#160;I wasn't as impressed with the soup. &#160;I dream about this place when I'm not in Seattle. We were visiting Seattle and just followed the smell. This place is right across from Pike's market had a line to the street (ok, it is a small store, maybe ~10 people can fit inside the store at a time). but it smelled wonderful and people were lined up at like 3 in the afternoon. Not knowing what a piroshky is, we found out that it is a flaky russian pastry with various stuffings. I ordered a chicken and rosemary and my friend ordered a apple stuff. Both were very tasty. Both items were served warm and went great with a bowl of chowder we had down the street.
I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food - not eating meat and not being all that into cheese make it a lot easier to make great stuff at home for a lot cheaper. Mama's does have a great (HUGE) veggie burrito that they very unfortunately put lettuce in - when you re-heat it the next day or later that night it's all soggy. But it's great fresh.The atmosphere is pretty fun- we went there with some friends the other night and there was a group of musicians serenading the tables with Mexican music, and when they got to our table they asked for any requests, so my boyfriend asked if they knew any songs about little ghosts (he says the White Stripes "Little Ghost" makes him think of me because I'm so pale). They thought he said goats. He explained and we all laughed (FYI - they do NOT know any songs about goats). Well maybe I just had my hopes set a little too high, but this place didn't exactly live up to the hype. I'd say the food is solid, but not spectular. &#160;I did enjoy my steak burrito, but &#160;margarita was so-so. &#160;I'd choose Gorditos anyday. This place is really fun. &#160;Great kitschy artwork everywhere. &#160;The Elvis room is awesome. &#160;Great service and waitstaff. &#160;Food was good and the drinks amazing.... I thought the food was ok. &#160;They give you large portions for the money. Strawberry Margaritas are good. Great location located in Belltown. I've had good times at Mama's before...but today was the best. Mostly because they seated us in the ELVIS ROOM! The Elvis room rocks. There service was totally on-point and friendly and my steak fajitas were excellent. I know there are places probably with better mexican food than Mama's....but c'mon, this place has got Flavah! Awesome service, good food, great atmosphere. Dun and dun. I never considered Mama's to be a good place for Mexican but the one thing I do love is their Menudo. &#160;It's the best one I've had in the city so far and like they say on their menu, it's excellent for hangovers. Big Ass Burritos, Strong Ass Margaritas and the hottest waitstaff in Belltown...this place ROCKS! Not the best Mexican in town...but character and charm go a long way and this place has been here for 32 years. Great place to meet-up with friends before hitting the bars and clubs in Belltown. My first vist to Mama's was - well, sorta like going home to mama.The food isn't fabulous, but it's hot and tasty and full of love. The decor is kitschy yet comforting.Our waitress was a mom type, and she took good care of us - she kept the margaritas comin.The food is really a cushion for the tequila, so it serves it's purpose. Mariachis can make conversation a little difficult, but I love mariachis, so I don't mind.I have two words for you: Prawn Quesadilla.(If you have been to La Rondalla in San Francisco - this is its' doppleganger, and is unfairly dissed by some SF Yelpers who just don't get it IMO). For authentic Mexican, it definately fails.For non-authentic Mexican, it also fails. &#160;And the reason why is that there isn't much flavor in the giant plates of bland food they bring you. &#160;I'll settle for servicable fake burritos and enchiladas when they at least get the American Mexican flavor right. &#160;It doesn't even do that, and I have to drench the food in Tapatio (the place doesn't even have Cholula, so even more fail) to get anything out of it.Wait staff is pretty dim. &#160;Bunch of lackies that seem to skip over tables or spend time at the bar chatting up people instead of waiting on tables like they should. &#160;Ambience is decidedly gaudy, music too loud in most areas so you can't hear the person next to you talking, etc.Just skip this place. &#160;I wish I had a better Mexican restaurant in the area to point you to, but sadly there aren't many good places in the downtown area. The draw for me to Mama's goes sumthin like this: &#160; &#160; ~ Steak and eggs, which goes perfectly with tequila shots and margaritas (before, during and after). This comes out to the table fast and hot. &#160; &#160; ~ The Elvis burrito is a tasty take on the the ever lovin' carne asada burrito, yes most times it's chockerbox full of avocado. &#160; &#160; ~ The service, it's not swanky but look where I am! I'm in Belltown and the moment I leave Mama's I'll have to endure all the unwashed masses smoking outside and working on their "I could careless" facial expressions while trying to out-cool each other as they booze it up at the neighbor's. So, for me, the service at Mama's is top-notch for Belltown. They say hello and goodbye, thank you and, "Shit, did you really order another shot? I'm sorry. It's on me." No, it's not authentic, nor is it particularly good. It is however exactly what you need before/during/after a night of stumbling around Belltown with co-workers who you only planned on hanging out with for Happy Hour. There is plenty of room, the wait is never long, and they have an Elvis room that is sure to spark conversation. The wait staff knows the perfect balance of being alternately patient and stern with your buzzed companions. Get that guy some chips!In no time flat a 'very hot plate' filled with pseudo Mexican food arrives. They cover this plate in cheese and throw it under the broiler. Just pick the cheese off the top and eat it quickly without looking. It's good, but weird. So weird that when you heat up the leftovers it will defy the laws of physics and turn into another type of mass entirely. Then, when you try to wash off that plate it will stick to everything and make you wonder how you ever ingested that cheese. You probably didn't, it's probably a permanent part of your body now. Don't think about the cheese.Drink your margarita on the rocks with salt and be thankful you are not eating a belltown hot dog.
Brunch is definitely all that. Seafood galore. Chocolate fountain with fresh fruit and other delectables. Omelette station and more.Dinner, however, is overpriced for the quality in my opinion. YMMV. Not a bad dinner, but one of those somewhat touristy, special occasion joints to be sure. As others have said, brunch is superb and the view is out of this world. We've had several special occasion family dinners here and they were all memorable. Expensive, but memorable. The lights of Seattle twinkling on the water, elegant atmosphere, fabulous food... you have to eat here at least once. Pretty much the epitome of great seafood with great views. &#160;Salty's is a Northwest classic in terms of excellent restaurants. &#160;They offer superb service as well, just be prepared to drop some serious coin as you enjoy every succulent morsel of that swordfish steak!
This was my first introduction into the world of Pho (years ago). It will cure what ails you whether it is the cold weather, a cold or a hangover. Good Pho, Quick service and cheap. Exactly as it should be. This place can get a little packed around 12 so try to come early. I just finished my first lunch at Pho Hiho and it certainly won't be my last. &#160;I had to do some business next door at the licensing agency so I dropped in for a quick lunch. &#160;The interior looks like your basic pho joint but it was a much friendlier greeting than I am used to.I decided on a small bowl of steak pho and a side of shrimp fresh rolls. &#160;The first thing I noticed about the pho was that it was certainly packed full. &#160;I really can't believe that they are able to cram so many noodles into that bowl. &#160;The beef wasn't skimped on either but I found the cut of meat was a bit tougher than what I am used to at Than Bros. &#160;What really impressed me was the complexity and richness of the broth. &#160;It wasn't as perfumed as others that I have had but instead was dark and, well, beefy goodness. &#160;The fresh roll was very fresh but a bit bland. &#160;It really needed every bit of the dipping sauce that came with it.Throughout my lunch the gracious staff checked in on me and even topped off my soda for me. &#160;Certainly not the level of service I have experienced while dining on pho at TB.There are not many options for pho in the Georgetown/Tukwila area so finding Pho Hiho gives me just another option for south end lunch. You can ask them to make your Pho with vegetable stock and they'll cook up a fresh batch for you. &#160;Note to omnivores: if you want better tasting, and recently cooked pho soup, ask for the vegetable stock! &#160;otherwise, the other stuff has probably been sitting on the burner all day. &#160; :) something like 8 years ago in sd, i used to chill with these street racer guys that would get high then always say, "man, i feel like some FUH-! yo you wanna get some FUH-, homie? let's go get some FUH-!" i learned, of course, that they were saying pho. so being vegetarian, i used to just sit there, (while they were practically creaming their pants,) not partaking, and not understanding, cuz everything was beefy stocky; and back then, pho, and vegetarianism for that matter, &#160;not being as popular as it is now, lacked that option. anyway, i never really had it on my radar cuz my thinking was always "dude it's soup; how good can soup get?" right? wrong.holy hell pho is sooo good! i saw years ago how big the bowls are, but always thought "it's soup, how full can you get?" right? wrong, again! so finally i got the chance when another bruh-in-law came up from the bay area and was feeling like vietnamese. yo, yall already know, so what can i say? i have no other phos to compare theirs to but from the first sip, which stopped me mid-conversation to exclaim at it's goodness, i was eye-rolling, trying not to cream my pants, in ecstasy--holy moly!this place is a little unassuming family-owned spot in a strip mall; what to say? 6.50 and i got a bowl of (score! fried, not soft-) tofu pho so big (&amp; it was the "small"!) i actually couldn't finish it; and i was trying! i just kept wanting more in my mouth! i got a bomb ass taro boba tea too. but when are they ever not bomb, right? right. The place looks like your typical mediocre Asian strip mall restaurant. &#160;But look again. &#160;It is usually jammed during the weekday lunch hour. &#160;If I were a betting man, I'd say the Georgetown workers who frequent the place like the food. &#160;Popularity doesn't prove anything, but look at the menu--it's idiot simple: about 20 kinds of pho and 5 to 10 kinds of vermichelli bowls, rice plates, fried rice, and chow mein. &#160;Yeh, you can breeze in and out of here once or twice and come up with a "meh" &#160;rating. &#160;But I'd argue your sample size was too small. &#160;Try 3 or 4 dishes in each category over a period of years--like I have--and you'd probably judge the FOOD CONSISTENTLY GOOD. &#160;Well, that's my explanation for the rating, and I'm sticking to it . . . .
This place has decent food, but nothing really special. It's basically a youshoku menu, i.e. Japanese versions of western dishes (curry, spaghetti, hamburger, etc.), so if that idea is new to you, then you might do well to try this place out. I had the hitokuchi tonkatsu -- basically tenderloin-sized medallions of pork (deep fried), which were good, but not outstandingly so, and certainly not approaching anything like the kurobuta tonkatsu I've had on a couple of occasions in Japan. You can order entrees &#224; la carte from the menu, or for a couple of extra bucks get the "dinner", meaning that the entree would be served with miso soup and rice. Mine also included a small side portion of spaghetti and a few vegetables. The miso soup is okay, but I was a bit puzzled by the choice of medium-grain rice. (Maybe it's cheaper?) They also feature a full bar, which, along with the fact that they are open late -- 2:00 a.m. -- I think are probably their main draws. I might go again for a drink, but wouldn't really go out of my way to sample the food. I think I'd probably try the Maekawa room directly opposite first. The plate of spaghetti that was brought to me at Fort St. George isn't your average plate of pasta, it's been prepared with cod roe. The Tarako served at Fort St. George is a big plate of spaghetti speckled with little pink fish eggs and topped with shredded nori. The little pink fish eggs add delightful aroma and color to the wonderfully al dente pasta dish. I found the dish to be well balanced and flavorful. The pasta was not too salty or fishy. The spaghetti was cooked just right and not too soggy. I really enjoyed the Tarako for a first timer at Fort, I'm pleased and will be returning to try their Katsu. Since I'm not a clubber i usually come here with my friends and enjoy lots of drinks. we never waited for the tables we were seated immediately the waitress are friendly as for the bartenders. very good appetizers i recommend getting the ka-ra-age, mix sauages and bacon, eggs and spinach mouthwatering as i say. Theres a drink called a bitch drink hahaha just made for me and my friends, I'm not sure whats in it but there is ice cream involved and multiple liquors. If you want to avoid the club scene come to this place. I've been going here ever since I moved to this state which is quite some time (many years). The food is really more american food but cooked in a japanese style. The dishes are all pretty good and you can't really miss. It's been fairly consistent over the years though its gone ever so slightly downwards over time. Pricing is completely fair for what you are getting and if it was close to my work or home, I would probably be there about 2-3x a week since I enjoy this kind of food.Disclaimer: I would claim to be an "expert" in this type of food. Hint: Try the lunch special, you get two choices out of four and a great deal! Service is great, nice little spot to hang out for lunch. If you go in the late evenings, you can have some good drinks as well.Dishes: Try the spaghetti (different from italian, as i said its a japanese style cooked food), curries, fried chicken, hamburger steak, fried rice, and more. YUMMY simple "deli" food. Can't say much about the prices mostly cause I didn't pay much attention and didn't pay.So let me tell you what kind of food you can expect so you can decide whether or not you want to give this place a try. If going for the "American" food think simple American style food with the "Asian" (more specifically "Japanese") perspective of what American food is or should be. For example spaghetti, a common type of pasta (and just a small FYI pasta = commonly ONLY spaghetti in Japan) only has one way of being prepared, spaghetti and a tomato beef sauce. None of that fancy carbornara, chardonnay white sauce, alfredo, or creamy yaddy yah sauce, just good ol' meaty tomato sauce. The sandwiches here are the same way, simple brunch/lunch ish ingredients, egg. ham, cucumber, etc (in the combo sandwich).If going for the more Japanese authentic items like curry and the like, you can just assume it's the same as every other place you've been to. Not the best, but not bad either. OH! I WOULD HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND the MUSHROOM AND BACON DORIA! OMGGGGG sooooo DELICIOUS. This is just awesome fusion right here! Anyway, A and his buddy have been coming here for years, which means you can think of it as consistent comfort food.DORIA.DO-RI-A. I only go here at night, but their happy hour specials on food are great. &#160;Best dish at happy hour is the spicy fried chicken. &#160;And if you get drunk enough, you can earn up the courage to do karaoke downstairs. Delicious!What is it about Japanese Spaghetti that is so wonderful?Although I can make curry at home, it's worth paying for theirs. Yummy for my tummy. Great place. They have Japanese style Curry. None of authentic Japanese restaurants serve curry, so I was impressed. Very inexpensive place to eat awesome food. Give it up for Fort St George!! My hubby and I decided to go for spaghettis, which is kind of a fusion of japanese and italian. The noodles are cooked al dente and you can get with cod roe or just old good fashion butter flavor but with enoki mushrooms.Overall, the meal was yummy. The place is small and not too fancy but the food is good and cozy.I had the lunch special once and the hamburger steak was good but the battered fish was a bit greasy.The dorias, which are casserole creamy rice topped with cheese that is golden brown broiled is also very delicious. We had the mushroom and broccoli as well as the bacon and mushroom, both were very very good.The kimchi fried rice is not too sour like in other places and it is delicious.Best of all, it is not too expensive to give them a try. I dine here regularly to have their spaghetti with meat sauce, hamburger steak, and garlic mayo...it's delicious! My friends and I regularly have cravings for the spaghetti and pretty much all order the same thing every time we visit. The restaurant has a casual ambience and simple style with nothing particularly fancy about it. The service is always good; I haven't had to complain on any of my visits. Other than the amazing spaghetti, I've also enjoyed the curry, fried rice, and doria. Everything's pretty good here...but nothing beats the spaghetti. This is one of my regular spots to satisfy special cravings. It's okay. I've come here a few times, usually because we're in the area and my friend knows the bartender. Stiff and cheap drinks, but service is lacking and can be slow. . Food isn't all that great either. Come here for the drinks. Best bar in the ID for sure. That's not really saying much, but whatever! Big screen TV for games. Nice bartenders. Strong drinks. And if you get too smashed on those strong drinks to have any kind if good human judgement, pop on down to the private room karaoke place downstairs. What more could you ask for?I've never really tried the food here. I've perused the menu it seems like Japanese based diner food. Looks good! Really chill place, I love the Japanese fusion food. Love everything on their menu. Love this place!HOWEVER I realized I don't love this place as much as I thought after I took my mom. ("Mom! There's this adorable little place in ID. I want to take you!") She's not super picky or anything but just that day I realized how dirty the place is, bad the service is, and overpriced the food is....But I still love it! It's a nice little place with good food for college students who aren't asking for &#160;too much. Past the crackheads, past the homelessness, past the social service centers, past the tai chi, past the feng shui, past the video games, past the karaoke... lies some of best Yoshoku you can find in the city. Connected to Maekawa, this one of a kind boasts some of the finest Japanese cuisine in the I.D., if not the city. Full bar, strong drinks, delicious food. Curry w/ hamburger steak, spaghetti w/ hamburger meat sauce are some of the things you'll find on the menu.Definitely a good place to drink before Seahawks/Mariners. This is the go to bar for my asian friends and I. I came here on a Saturday night around 10pm and was able to sit immediately...and everytime I've been here, I've never had to wait for a table. Its not dead but its not full. Also they understand the social nature of wanting to sit and drink with friends so I've never felt rushed before. Its small but can accommodate anywhere from 1-7 people in a party. Although its located in a funky building, you get over it once you go often...and if you've had enough drinks here, you can go downstairs for karaoke!They have great cocktails, and one cocktail thats not on the menu any longer but my friends always order still is called the evergreen...a must try! The late night snack menu isn't anything spectacular, instead if you want to try their food, come for dinner. Their Japanese curry is pretty authentic and hits the spot. Food and drink prices are fairly average, and the service isn't too bad either. I give it four stars because I know I'm going to come back and I know what to expect every time without disappointment.
I live up the street from Betty. &#160;When my sister was in town for Spring Break, we made an effort to hit several little places we had never been to before.BETTY WAS PRETTY SWEET!The service was lively. &#160;We made a reservation (via Yelp of course) and were seated right away by the window for a group of four. &#160;I love sitting by the window because I want to be seen when I'm out. &#160;It was really a pleasant evening.Three of us had the Betty Burger, which was substantially larger than I expected. &#160;My sister had the pan roasted chicken, which was also generously portioned.For those of you who would be traveling to Queen Anne from elsewhere, FREE PARKING ON QUEEN ANNE AVE, WHOOOHOOO! :) Wow.. Came here for Happy Hour and never knew this place had a back room. I highly recommend coming here for Happy Hour. The place is classy with just enough dark ambiance to make this place sexy. The food was great! We went small place style and got the following items. Happy Hour Clams were amazing. The broth was interesting with just enough kick to it. Hour Hour Frites - Yummy fries. How can you go wrong with frieds.Happy Hour Lemon Drop - Tasty, tasty, tasty!Happy Hour Oysters - YUM!Happy Hour Wine by the glassMix GreenYes.. Betty. I heart you! I recently tried Betty for the first time and boy, am I ever a fan. The ambiance was fantastic. We were slightly surprised at how short the menu was. At first it put us off a little bit, but we both found something that sounded like it could be ok.When the food came, our choices were validated. I had the lamb ragout. It had plenty of meat, fresh peas, rich sauce and freshly made noodles. It was a huge amount of food but the flavors were so amazing that I managed to eat the entire thing.Be sure to get reservations (http://opentable.com makes it easy.) Not bad BettyWent here for dinner with friends. Don't be confused by the velvet curtain as you walk through the door. Weird way to keep the cold out. They can seat about 8 at most. The server was friendly. Tried the Betty burger and beer. Burger was huge and not as flavorful as I hoped. The fries were burnt and not that great. I tried my friend's dishes and I'll have to get the chicken next time. No one tried the rib eye steak and frites and I'm curious about that one. The menu is already changing, but never let's me down. I've been here at least 10 times and have never been served a mediocre meal --everything here is delicious.The service is exceptional and very friendly. The setting is casual, and conveniently located on Queen Anne Ave.It can be a little pricey, but certainly worth it. I wouldn't say that I was a fan, but this is an okay place to go. &#160;I'd say it's a seven of ten more than a three of five, but I round halves down.Mom was up visiting from Alabama. &#160;I don't know why she ever agrees to go out with us, because it is always the same: &#160;too slow, too expensive, too salty, one dollar should be enough tip.This time she didn't grouse about the tip, although she'd been skipped on the water service (as I had), but she remarked on the friendliness of the people there. &#160;Service was timely. &#160;I also ordered a to-go meal for my wife who wasn't with us, they timed it perfectly. &#160;On a separate check, in fact, which they had no problem doing.They got us in during Seattle Restaurant Week, which was awesome.I had the Wild Boar spaghetti (I think they had a fancier name for it, but that's what it was), which my brother also had. &#160;He didn't like it at first, but liked it at the end. &#160;I noticed no improvement, but I liked it from the get-go. &#160;Brother had a point though, he would have had no problem making any of those dishes at home, except the scrumptious desserts.The food was oversalted. &#160;The salt was pretty pervasive, and that's really my only knock on the joint.Takeaway: &#160;I recommend that you try it. &#160;I can see why some people have it as a favorite, it's just not one of mine. The only reason I wouldn't go back here is because your clothing always smells like bacon grease or something when you leave. &#160;It takes a few washes to get the smell out. &#160;Other than that, the wine pours are nice, the staff is great and their tapas is delish. &#160;Wear an old coat when you go there though, you've been forewarned. This is my go-to restaurant for happy hour in Queen Anne! The menu is amazingly delicous, both for HH and the regular menu. The HH menu is priced really well and the five dollar wine pours are too tempting to not pass up! The frites are delicious with just the right amount of salt. They always have either clams or mussels, and both are my favorite thing to get off of the HH menu! The pulled pork mole tacos are tasty, too, and my husband always orders them when we go.Service is friendly, helpful and relaxed. They aim at letting you have a great time in the restarant, with no pressure about getting you in and out quickly, which is appreciated.Oh - and about two years ago I got a savory stinging nettle risotto that I still dream about to this day. It was THAT good. And right now I'm waiting for the right time to go and have their halibut... oh it should be heavenly!Definitely go to Betty if you're around the top of QA. And by 'definitely go', I mean, 'go all the time!'PS: In the summertime they open up their back patio - woohoo!! Sunshine AND great food!! (Excellent time to get the prosecco and some salami + olives on a Friday evening!) The original dinner plan was Lloyd Martin, then suddenly the place was on fire. And by that I mean it included fire trucks. So, I met Peter and Ron at Betty instead. NEVER have I waited so long for a burger. The servers were incredibly good but the kitchen was as devastatingly slow as drowning in ice water in Hell. The drinks were weak and overly expensive.The food was average but sorta pretty.I rank Betty high for service only. My boyfriend and I were looking for a casual place to eat in Upper Queen Anne and have always wanted to try Betty. &#160;I was very surprised to see bottles of wine in ice buckets on customer's tables, but I was very pleased to see that we were in for a treat. &#160;We shared an order of Sauteed Squid and Green Olives, which was absolutely delicious as a starter. &#160;It was also pretty plentiful for an app. &#160;We both then shared a Ribeye Steak and also substituted the fries (after seeing a HEAPING load of fries on another customer's plate) with some mixed organic greens (yum!!). &#160;The ribeye steak was very plentiful, it would've been too much for one person. &#160;It was SO GOOD. are you too lazy to marinate a chicken and pan roast it to perfection in a cast iron skillet for dinner tonight?not to worry, betty has got you covered. the meat will be succulent and well seasoned. heck, they will even through in some roasted potatoes and vegetables. who needs to order sides?i'm afraid I won't order anything else here now. Found this place when our first choice in Queen Anne couldn't guarantee our reservation. Overall, we were quite pleased with the food and the ambience. Unlike some places nearby, you can actually have a conversation and it has a nice feel to it. &#160;The food is good,although the wine list leaves a bit to be desired.Service is OK. They are pleasant, but you get a lot of "no"'s from them. Simple requests are greeted with a "no". &#160;We had a birthday, and while I really don't mind paying for my own dessert, an acknowledgement would at least be nice. &#160;Why else would you ask? This is a place that does things right. We went to Betty's for happy hour after walking y it so many times. All items were very reasonably priced, we tried several different things and we were pleased with all of them. The menu might be a bit too traditional if you will, but the food was cooked right. Also if you sit at the counter you can see the chefs cook your food which is a definite plus, I like to see what goes into my plate and I like it when the kitchen is kept in a proper manner and they are not afraid of showing it to the customers. Could be the nicest staff I've ever encountered. &#160;And the food was excellent. &#160;I'll be back... Pretty good if you are looking for pub/bistro fare. But don't expect great things if you order a steak or anything "fancy." Delicious. Tthere are so many tempting things on their menu it's hard to know where to begin. &#160;The parmesan tarte is like a cloud--not quiche, not custard with the flavor of fresh parmesan, it defies words. &#160;The homemade pea soup equally fine--tasted the fresh herbs and split peas soft but still holding their shape, and not too heavily flavored with ham--perfect for this extended winter weather. &#160;Several entrees on the menu--fragrant chicken, a vegetarian tangine among others. I ordered the braised/stewed lamb shank. &#160;Betty's version is superb--marvelous lamb that has been slow cooked so that the meat falls off the bone served with a rich vegetable-enhanced tomato-based sauce and a bed of creamy polenta. &#160;Never had lamb that tasted as good as this. &#160;Usually declining dessert, on the fabulous $30 deal this month I indulged. Either of the homemade ice creams are sublime--one with a Guiness caramel sauce and the other, a homemade wedge of Neopolitan ice cream (the strawberry layer tasted like FRESH strawberries!) rests in a shallow pool of dark chocolate fudge sauce. &#160;And three thin dark chocolate shortbread coins hail invitingly from the top of the ice cream wedge daring you to dip them into the fudge sauce too! &#160;Strongly recommend Betty for anyone who knows the difference between ordinarily good and extraordinary! &#160;Betty is in that extra-excellent category. &#160; I found service to be wonderful--fast, warm, not intrusive and I liked the modern feel of the place. &#160;Lighting that was just right for regular meal or romance! Not pretentious, very welcoming, elegant enough to feel like you have dined well. This has become our "go-to" place for great food. &#160;It gets better every time we go. &#160;The burger is great, the chicken is great, and the cassoulet was amazing when we went. &#160;You can't go wrong with anything on the menu - check it out! The menu is small and simple and the atmosphere is exactly what you'd expect in upper Queen Anne, a great date night spot. &#160;We were a little confused by the entrance which appears to be an entrance to nowhere, but once we passed through the curtain and took our seats everything was great. &#160;We both ended up with the roast chicken, partly because of an ordering gaffe on my part, but I couldn't have been happier. &#160;The chicken was moist and tender and had a delicious crispy skin and the portion size was perfect. &#160;Betty definitely found a spot in the regular rotation for me and the girlfriend. Never been here before or heard of the place. &#160;Went here for the $30 prix fixe menu..this was really a great neighborhood restaurant. &#160;Service was very very slow though...first course was parmesan pudding and grapefruit vinigrette...$12 and $14 respectively...very tasty, the grapefruit added a nice kick..the melted parmesan on crostini was very tasty and it had a pesto add in to round it off...entree was roast chicken and pork loin atop savoy cabbage..the pork was really good and the sauce with the cabbage was very peppery...almost too peppery but I like spicy...The roast chicken was really good too, the breast was moist. &#160;mid $20 range for both..dessert was $8 for any dessert, got the guiness ice cream with brownie bites without the shot of alcohol and the panna cotta...never had panna cotta before, it was with grapefruit....unusual gelatin consistency..not bad but not really good, the candied grapefruit rind was too intense...the ice cream was fine, just ice cream with brownies...can't go wrong with that... Don't think you can go wrong with Betty. Unpretentious, good food and service. Happy hour is especially nice, impressed with their wine by the glass selections and generous pours! Very comfortable, from making reservations the day of for a business dinner , to greeting us, to the ease of the menu. &#160; the Queen Anne area is a very busy place and parking is crazy. I had the duck confit with a lamb sausage, swiss chard. &#160;good comfort food for a california person eating in the "cold (not yet) NorthWest.
Was passing by this place today with my sister and friend when my sister had an instant craving for bbq (she smelled the bbq aroma from 'Donna's Diner' and realized that it's connected to Mac's Smokehouse). &#160;Since she picked me up from downtown to run some errands in the SODO district, I couldn't say no to her request. &#160; &#160;The minute we stepped inside you could tell that ventilation was either off or not strong enough as there was a constant cloud of bbq smoke coming from the grills. &#160;The waitress was nice enough to greet us (even though we had to cut her personal phone call short). &#160; We opted to order to-go.Our food took about 10 minutes to be ready. &#160;I had a beef sandwich. &#160;It was ok. &#160;Could have used a bit more flavor. &#160;My sister ordered ribs and chicken - she enjoyed the ribs but not the chicken. &#160;She said they could have put more flavor into the ribs sinec it did not have flavor through and through. &#160;My friend ordered the chicken-salad sandwich and it was very mayo-ie. &#160;Price was decent, cleanliness of the place was surprisingly cleaner than anticipated based upon the exterior it had. &#160;Speed of service was good. &#160;Glad we took our orders togo as we smelled like bbq smoke after 10 minutes of waiting (expected ... but still). Bottom-line, don't know if I'll ever go back on my own. &#160;But if someone really wanted me to go, I guess I would (depends on who I'm with). &#160;hehe. &#160;I'd probably be there more for the company than the food.
A solid place to get teriyaki. &#160;I tried it for the first time today, and was really impressed with how tender the chicken was. &#160;Not dry at all, very fresh. &#160;Nice! &#160;I had to take one star off though because of the glaze. &#160;While it was yummy, it was extremely salty. &#160;I don't remember ever having teriyaki glaze this salty anywhere. &#160;It was still edible and had a rich, dark soy flavor, though.The salad dressing is AMAZING. &#160;Seriously, seriously good. &#160;The rice, of which there was a huge portion, was perfectly cooked. &#160;I hate mushy rice, so this was a big plus.I'll be back! This is my favorite Teriyaki place! &#160;I couldn't recommend it enough. &#160;I eat there all of the time. &#160;The woman up front is so kind. &#160;Go here! This is my go to Teriyaki place. It's not only because I live close, but the service is always great, fast, and accurate. I can't say that I've ever had a bad meal there. The wait is never very long, and no existent if you phone in your order. I will continue to visit here regularly. This sunny is head and shoulders the best one. &#160;I've eaten a lot of teriyaki and this spicy chicken is the best I've ever had. &#160;And it is always good day in day out
Hands down, best Thai food I've ever had. &#160;Panang Curry and Pad Thai are my current fave's, but I'm pretty sure there's not a bad item on the menu. &#160;They're cheap, and portions definitely big enough to box half to take home and reheat for your 10 pm Bachelorette marathon... or whatever...Seriously, I don't know why you're still reading this and not en route to The Ave right now. This place has the most delicious and authentic Thai food in Seattle! &#160;I mean their phad thai is brown and not that ketchup color at other restaurants. I'm giving this place 4 stars and not 5 because their menu selection is rather limited, but I will say that everything on their menu is tasty! &#160;Keep in mind that they only accept cash. The restaurant is rather small, so my best advice would be to get your order to go. Plus parking is always a mess because it's located on the ave. I went to UW for 4 years and this is the only Thai place that I never went to. I just came back and tried it. Boy was I missing out. Thaiger room is great, but this place beats it hands down.This place is fun and the food is also excellent. If you have the opportunity, sit in one of the chairs on the far right (immediately after you enter the door). The grill is right there, and you get to see everything that goes into making your food. During the cold months it doubles as a heater. Seating is limited and might be a bit cramped for some people with big space bubbles, but I like that kind of atmosphere so it was perfect for me.My GF ordered Pad Thai (1 star spicy), and I ordered Panang Curry (level 3 spicy). Our dishes both came out more spicy than we expected (compared to other Thai restaurants) so keep that in mind when you order.Both dishes were very good. They were full of flavor and they came out hot and fresh off the grill. Because most (possibly all) of the seating in this place is at a bar around the grilling area, the chef himself delivers your food. The portions are very filling.The best part about this place in my opinion is watching the chef cook. He's fast, accurate, and full of life. It's not like those japanese restaurants where they turn on a strobe light and start flinging their spatula around (I hate those places because I'd prefer that the chef does something functional rather than make a bunch of noise to try and impress me). No everything that the chef does is in an effort to get you the best food as fast as possible, and it's very fun to watch.Cash only (The best restaurants are cash only aren't they?) ;) I went her this afternoon for lunch with a friend. i have been hearing about this spot for a long time, so I was really excited to finally try it out. It was pretty small, but i got there early enough to sit immediately. I really liked the wood menus. They were cute and added an unique touch.I am one of those people who orders the same thing every time I go out for Thai food. So, of course when i sat down and read the menu, I immediately ordered the panang curry. You can order your food from heat level 1 to 5, with 5 being the most heat. I love spicy food and don't always believe people when they say something is hot, but the heat level here was right on. I ordered a 3 and was totally satisfied. A little kick and tons of flavor. I can't wait to try the 4! I really enjoyed the panang here. It was exactly what I wanted and combined with the perfect amount of rice. The service was really quick, attentive, and no-fuss. I will definitely be back. Don't know what else to say that hasn't already been said.Amazingly, delicious thai food. My ALL-TIME favorite place to go for curry.I always go there and get one thing: shrimp panang curry. &#160;What makes their panang curry so different from other thai joints is that it isn't a soup; rather, it's more of a curry SAUCE that is so nommy. Call ahead, get your grub to go, and don't forget your cash because it's CASH ONLY. Thai Tom is THE BEST and most authentic Thai food restaurant I've ever been to. The ambiance is legit.... you feel like you're in Thailand! For some, it may just look like a hole-in-the-wall but it's more than that, you get the ultimate dining experience as if you were visiting from out of the country. I loved it!You have a full view of the kitchen and all the action. Every dish is fresh and perfect. I had the spicy chicken &amp; eggplant and my boyfriend had the red panang curry. The spice is amazing.. a little more spicier than usual, but still very good. It has been a whole year since I've been back to Seattle, but I remember this place being packed (when you're good, you're GOOD). Rain or shine, I'm sure this place is packed everyday/night. They don't take reservations so come prepared to wait (the wait is WELL WORTH IT). The venue is small so it's limited seating and doesn't have a lot of wiggle room, but I like the intimacy. I would definitely recommend trying it out at least once. Party in your mouth! :) This was a big treat given the thai fare that is offered in Vancouver - and believe me, I've tried it all. It's either over priced and all wrong, or cheap with ketchup (you know what I mean...)Ventured down south with the husband and he recommended stopping by Thai Tom as he went to UW and frequented this little Thai hole-in-the- wall a billion times.Honestly, outside of Thailand, this is the best Thai food I've ever had. I decided to stick with the classic - Pad Thai as did my husband. PERFECT! Especially at $6 a plate. On a side note, I love the U district. So quaint with lots of hole-in-the-wall options.The downside to this place is it's really smokey - you stink of Thai food when you leave - and it's packed full of people (mostly UW students). I understand why this place is so popular now. The food is good, and the prices at $7.50 per entree are reasonable. But the mainstay is the chef whom we'll call Tom.Tom is amazing. The speed at which he moves, it's a wonder he doesn't injure himself. It appears that he's the one guy who cooks the orders, he has an assistant who preps the raw ingredients and sets them out for Tom to use. When he's done with a pan and ladel, in one quick motion he flips them vertical and hands them to the assistant and moves on to the next dish. It's very entertaining to watch and if you can get a seat at the bar, go for it. Best Pad Thai in town and stir fry with great wok zhi. &#160;It is more spicy than average Thai restaurant beware of telling the server how hot the food you want.Everything tastes good, love the iced coffee there. &#160;Always a line outside regardless of the time during any day. &#160;Restaurant is small and service is very quick.Price is cheap, two noodle dishes + 2 coffee for $22. &#160;Must visit if you are in U-district! Thai Tom, do you franchise? Want to expand? Phoenix needs a Thai place like this!I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Thai Tom! We found this place kind of on a whim. My friend and I were walking around the U-District and wanted to stop for lunch. We were going to go to this Pho place right next door, but decided that since the place was empty, we would instead try Thai Tom since people were waiting to get in. It was definitely worth the wait. The place is TINY, MAYBE as big as my bedroom (but doubt it). It's definitely a tight fit now matter your size or where you sit. But so worth it. I had the garlic pepper chicken. WOW. Flavor explosion. Cooked perfectly, the right amount of spiciness (sinus clearing spicy!). My friend had the pad thai. It was literally the best Thai food I have ever had! I love Thai Tom. This place makes the best Thai food I've ever had, and I'm kind of a Thai food fanatic. The first time I had Thai Tom's, it was my friend's cold left-over Swimming Rama. Best. Ever. Obviously, when it's hot and fresh the food is even better. I love the feel of the restaurant, too. It's perfect for what it is- a tiny, authentic, hole-in-the-wall restaurant. I love that it's tiny, that it sometimes has cockroaches running around (though I do hope they're not actually in the food - never in my experience), it's hot and fast-paced and loud. I have never had an order I didn't like at Thai Tom's. Their best dish, in my opinion, is the Swimming Rama. Highly recommended!! I came here a few times and walked right to a table. The last time I went here, I was waiting outside for about 20 minutes, in the rain, but... It was well worth it. Of all Seattle and Bellevue so far, this is probably the best place you can find Thai Food that's not in someone else kitchen! :-OYou can enjoy your non-alcoholic beverages with your friend or whomever, watch these three(?) guys cook 50 different things at once for all of their customers and listen to some type of new-age experimental pseudo dub-step trance stuff.. I don't really know, but you'll enjoy your time there.. If not, then :-( @ you. 4 1/2 stars...I don't think there is much more I can add to this. All 600+ reviews sum this place up nicely. It's small. It's busy. It's good. My mind wasn't blown with ~how~ good it was, but it was definitely up there with some of the top Thai places I have been.The lopsided stool was strange to sit on, the music really loud so me &amp; my school buddies didn't get to chat much -- but watching the people cook was awesome and by the time we had our food we were too focused on actually eating to talk to each other. The prices are good, and you'll leave stuffed and happy. I don't have enough good things to say about Thai Tom, I went there today for the first time in many years and the food was as good or even better than I remembered it. Not only does this tiny place kick out Seattle's best Thai food, hands down, the atmosphere is great. It's the kind of restaurant that makes you forget where you are; from the laquered plank of wood with gold writing that is the menu, to the classic rock blaring from the speakers, to the staff chattering to each other in rapid thai, this place transports you to a better place. A very, very delicious place. It's killing me inside to only give this place three stars, but I feel like they are making some poor decisions as of recent.Their Thai food is the best I have had in Seattle, and I have been a patron for the last 6 years. So it is still worth it to pay a visit to Thai Toms if you have never been. The true test of their deliciousness is trying their Pad Thai. Whenever I go to a new Thai restaurant, this dish is the test. I can't enjoy Pad Thai anywhere else anymore, because it tastes nothing like this.That being said, I went again this week and I was saddened by some changes.The service has never been superb, but it was really not great this last time. There seems to be some apathetic vibe towards customers because they are relying on their popularity. This can't last forever. We were rudely brushed off because we didn't want to order our meal outside before we sat down. We waited and waited, were never seated, so we just left.Other little changes...new menus look cheap and don't describe what any of the dishes are, new cheap bowls, higher prices (which are still pretty reasonable)Space has always been a problem; I can't understand why they don't expand at all.If the skinny, high energy, talented cook leaves, I may even stop coming here. He is the cornerstone of the establishment.Hope Thai Tom will make some changes, because I want to love it! The food here is to Thai for.. i mean, to die for.The pad thai here is AMAZING! I am not too good with spicy foods so I prefer 1 star. &#160;The last time I went I got 2 stars and was not faring too well. I love thai food, and the pad thai here is hands down THE BEST I've ever had.The seating is very limited - a handful of tables and about 10 seats at the counter. &#160;I've passed by in the evenings and have seen lines going out the door. &#160;The food comes pretty quickly and the servers are attentive so I doubt the wait is too long..but however long the wait, it would definitely be worth it.Note: CASH ONLY Thai Tom serves the best Thai food that i've ever had. The food is prepared in front of you in an open style kitchen where you can see the different Chefs hard at work. I don't use the term "Chef" freely, but these guys are amazing and have such a mastery over their menu that any other term does not do them justice. So far I have had the Swimming Rama multiple times (3-4 Stars) and the Spicy Noodles once. They food is always amazing and fulfilling. The locale is very small, about 20 people, and the focus of the business is good food and fast turnover. They only accept cash and wait times can be very long when attempting to dine during peak hours. If you are looking for a romantic dinner setting, then Thai Tom is not for you. As "dingy" as the location looks, it is very clean and all of the waitresses are wearing gloves and practice good hygiene. If the location was larger I would gladly give it a 5 star rating. Make no mistake, Thai Tom has 5 star quality food! Thats all the matters! I've been going here for many years now and still a fan, though not as much as I used to be. I would say it's overhyped, the wait is not worth it, but the price and taste is very good. It's probably one of the best thai places in the state but just not worth the "etc." in my opinion. I don't rate on service but will say it's the type of place where you shouldn't expect any friendly atmosphere.Hint: Go early if you want to eat there, otherwise call your order in and eat it at home. Cash only. Be wary as the cook throws all kinds of stuff into the dishes so if you have any allergies or issues, make sure you are absolutely clear or dont even bother going. I've had a 4 star made like a 1 star and a 2 star like a 4 star. lol, i've also seen peanuts when people asked for none.Dishes: My favorite dish in Thai has always been Phad Thai and think Thai Tom makes it one of the best. Their spring rolls are better than average.Disclaimer: By no means am I an expert in Thai food but I have had my share of both bad, average, and good experiences. YUUUM. One of my favorite Thai places East of Bangkok. It's a TINY place, but I've always timed my visit well so I never had to wait for a table. Everything I've had on the menu has been delicious. And I always make sure to get a thai iced tea (and refill) with my meal. This is the most street-atmosphere-authentic Thai restaurant I've been to in Seattle, I don't care about health code violations blahblahblah. THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS. Try to get your food to go during the rush time, as I've seen the line go out the door and down the street during peak time. Warning: extremely spicy! And don't go here without willing to smell like thai food in your clothes and hair. Oh the Thaiest of Toms, this place is ridiculously good. &#160;I so want to give it 5 stars, but it is in fact a bit dirty and I've seen things one should never see. Despite this, I go back all the time and I will keep going back. It's just that good.I know everyone loves Phad Thai, but who really cares about the Spaghetti and meatballs of Thai cooking? Adventure a little. I love the Phad Kee Mao, the Panang Curry is my favorite (it's not a soup, it's thicker and I love that!) and the Tom Kha soup is the best that I have ever had. Here is the reason I really love Tom, he is not afraid of the spice. I have been to so many places and you ask for 4 stars and you barely notice the spice. If you ask Tom for 4 stars they will blow your socks off. I had 5 stars once and I was uncomfortable, but so happy that they are not afraid to spice it up!Be prepared to wait a little, there is usually a small crowd outside and there are about 5 tables inside plus the bar. I did not learn from my previous review. I ordered the Pad Thai with two stars. :/ OMG HOT. This serves as a reminder to self and all those who can't handle the heat - get one star of spiciness! It's been a long time since I've been because I don't find myself in the u-district as much these days but I think I need to make a trip out soon since I miss this food! &#160;I love spicy Thai food and most often I am disappointed when I get the highest spice rating at a Thai restaurant but I was far from disappointed here, my nose started running like crazy, because of the spice! &#160;The next time I went in I got the second to highest spice! &#160;It's a little cramped and there is usually a line but that's proof of the great tasting food they provide! This is fabulous authentic Thai food! &#160;It took me a long time to finally stop in to try it, but it was just as amazing as I thought it would be.The food is spicier than at other restaurants (I usually order 2 or 3 stars, but here I got only 1 star).I went at 5pm on a Wednesday night and it wasn't that busy, so I ate inside. &#160;It's tiny and the chairs and stools are somewhat uncomfortable, so I might try getting my order to go next time, but the food is really good. HOLY COW!! I can't believe I haven't written a review on Thai Tom. It is absolutely hands-down one of my favourite Thai restaurants in Seattle. I love to perch on the counter, watch the amazing blazing fire, teamwork, and wok handling. (Afterwards, you are going to smell like Thai food, but who cares?)I love all kinds of their noodle dishes (especially fat rice noodles) with freshly deep-fried tofu. My absolute favourite is their eggplant dish. Oh so flavourful!!!You don't want to wait in line? You should avoid lunch/dinner hours, and be sure to bring cash. Extremely highly recommended!!! Best Thai food in the city! Nevermind what you read about service, the owner is very sweet and his staff work in a tiny, supercrowded and perpetually slammed/busy environment. My bf and I go regularly and have always left feeling totally satisfied. The food is delicious, no doubt about that. But I had to knock off two stars1) because the place is pretty dirty - that in itself it not appetizing at all2) I ordered takeout here around 8:30 one evening(they close at 9pm). The girl on the phone said it would take about 25 minutes. I arrived in 20 minutes, and the guy said it would be another 5-7 minutes, fair enough. However, it took so much longer than 5-7 minutes. I did not get my food until 9:30. They WERE busy, and that was obviously why, but don't quote a 25 minute wait time for takeout when it actually takes an hour. On top of that, don't quote a "only 5-7 minutes longer" when it actually will be another 30-35 minutes. It was ridiculous. I don't blame them for the long wait, only for the fact that they told me it would be a significantly shorter wait than it actually was. This place is pretty much the tops. Dont come here expecting ambiance or anything. it serves on purpose. o deliver amazing thai food. It pains me to give this place even one star. I used to be a firm aficionado of their food, ie until I learned that Seattle is larger than the U District. Honestly the high rating must be buoyed up by nothing more than the scores of kainophobic students who never venture beyond the Ave. A much better meal can be had around the corner in Ravenna at Bai Pai or if you want good Asian food at the real price it should cost simply take your pick of "undiscovered" hole-in-the-wall joints in the I District.Suffer no delusions: the spicy food is only average and the service exceptionally sub-par.After a few rough incidents that shook my faith in Tom, the final straw came when I was getting lunch with a friend and after seating us the waitress then determined to serve us nothing but cold shoulder. Now mind you, like I said, I used to think the cramped seating, the wobbly dirty stoles and tables, fighting with your neighbor's elbows, and the long waits and slow service were all part of the charm of Thai Tom so I was already familiar with the restaurant's "ambiance." This time, however, was ridiculous. When we finally got our meal she forgot to give me any chopsticks. So I asked, "Excuse me, could I please have some chopsticks?" She would not give me any freaking chopsticks! She just gave me a disdainful roll of her eyes and left me to tackle a plate of Phad Thai barehanded. After about 15 minutes of waiting to try asking again, my patience expired so I got up and found some chopsticks myself. Do yourself a favor and explore Seattle to find a hole-in-the-wall worthy of your dollars and that you can call your own. Seattle is chuck-full of awesome places to discover, so don't limit yourself to the Ave. Be careful of how spicy you make your order! A 3-star here at Thai Tom is NOT the same as a 3-star that you would get at most other restaurants. A 3-star here is probably the equivalent of a 5+ star at other places. Thai Tom is pure AWESOME! Seriously, some of the best Thai food I've ever eaten, hands down! Love the ambiance too! Try the fried tofu appetizer (super good dipping sauce). I got the swimming rama (spinach, bean sprouts, tofu in peanut sauce over rice = love)...I am still dreaming about eating it!!! The husband got a soup, which was good. I also tried a bite of the pad thai and another noodle dish, both of which were soo good. Unfortunately we ate at Thai Tom on the last day we were in Seattle, otherwise I would've wanted to go again and again!! Definitely will eat here again the next time we are in town! I'm not a huge fan of pad thai, but I LOVE it here. That and the swimming whatever-it-is dish. It's tiny so there's always a wait, but it's always worth it. I moved to the bay area but I still try to make it here every time I'm back in Seattle. Best. Food. Ever. This is a staple to my college diet and college experience. The wide ride noodles in peanut sauce is the BEST!!! Excellent food! Great experience! Energetic environment with the chef displaying extraordinary cooking skills,the best thai food I ever had. Green curry and spicy noodles, simply yummmmmmy!!!! Best Thai I've found in Seattle. If you can get it, the best seat in the house is at the counter RIGHT next to the stove. It's a lot of fun to watch them whip up those curries and stir-fries at a million miles an hour. I wouldn't try to come here with more than two people, though. It's tiny. Been here a handful of times, every time on a whim just when I happened to be in the area , (the U District isn't somewhere I frequent unless looking for a specific shop or...well thats it really)It's a tiny place located on the main Ave just north of 45th. There's only enough seating for about 8 at the bar and I think 3 tables of two, so don't be surprised to wait a few, you can always grab a quick beer at one of the nearby bars while you wait. Having said that, in all the times we've gone, we've been lucky enough to snag a couple seats, usually at the end of the bar. It's a small menu list, but been happy with all that we've tried. Everything is cooked in front of you as the grill/ entire kitchen is within arms reach from the counter, so be offended if you get a little splash from some random flying sauce as the cooks toss your meal around &#160;in the pans...its part of the experience!Definitely try the fried tofu, and Shrimp Curry soup. Delicious!Some things to consider before going:CASH ONLYSMALL SPACESNO BOOZEAll in all its a great quick stop for some Traditional fresh Thai food The best hole in a wall Thai food in Seattle. &#160;The dishes are really flavorful and it just hits the spot (my favorite is the Panang curry). &#160;The place is tiny and there is always a long line outside. &#160;But it's a place where you go to eat not to chat so the wait goes pretty fast. &#160;You'll wait quite a bit though if you go with 3 of your friends. &#160;They can easily accommodate a party of two. &#160;Also, unlike other Thai places, if you say you want it hot, you better really want it that hot because they err on the really spicy side. &#160;Definitely a must place to go.Parking can be a bit of a challenge on the Ave so if possible, bus it. I am obsessed with this place. Tom is amazing. In fact, the place is only amazing when Tom's cooking.... but still, this place is better than a lot of other Thai restaurants in the U district. They used to have really good prices, but since they increased the price, one of their selling point is gone. However, it doesn't mean that people are not waiting outside for hours for the limited items on the menu, still. What I love about Thai Tom is that they use those traditional woks, which makes the food really tasty, esp. right off the heat! You can have them prepare the dishes really spicy, yet still doesn't over power other flavors in the dish. I particularly like their spicy noodle dish (forgot what it's called)! So good! The only downside is you gotta wait for quite a while and the place is really crammed. One time, my ex-friend got hit on the head by a fan because it fell off the shelf (not joking). Still, Tom is the best! Cash only?!? Outrageous!! Beside this pitfall, Thai Tom dishes out some damn good pad thai. Typically I order takeout but occasionally I dine in. It's cramped, noisy, and you leave smelling like you lathered yourself in noodles...but I guess it's the food that matters, right? Enjoyed watching the guy cook about three feet in front of me - wanted to take notes. &#160;Not that my stove could even remotely produce the btu's their stove was producing that are necessary for good thai noodles. &#160;Ordered the pad thai. &#160;Why not. &#160;If you want to know how good a place is order a noodle dish. &#160;And pad thai seemed as good as any. &#160;At four stars the dish ended up not as spicy as I expected, but it tasted fine. &#160;Definitely no frills here, just good ol U-district cheap eats on the Ave. &#160; Pay no attention to the cockroach upside down near the stove trying to right itself so it can crawl to safety. &#160;I have seen much worse (and larger) creatures in restaurant kitchens. &#160;I will be back. Thai Tom used to be unquestionably the best Thai food I'd eaten in Seattle, though I've noticed of late that it depends on whether the owner is cooking or someone else... in the latter case, it hasn't been as good. &#160;But this little hole in the wall on The Ave is a show unto itself. &#160;There are only four or five tables plus some counter space, and if you can score a place to sit you can enjoy the cooking show almost as much as the outstanding food. &#160;The cook prepares everything behind the counter, and does so in a non-stop performance that's so frenetic you honestly wonder whether he swallows a handful of amphetamines before he starts work. &#160;Ingredients fly through the air from containers into the wok pans on the burners - I'd hate to have to clean up after him - and a helper stands to the side, ready to grab the last pan used and swing it over to the dishwasher, who gives the helper a clean pan, who passes it to the cook, who begins the whole show over for the next meal (everything is individually cooked to order while you wait). &#160;The food is cheap, and usually perfectly spiced (your choice on how spicy). &#160;Love love love their curries! &#160;Amazing place (with the above caveat), and great take-out if you can't find a space to park your rear. &#160;Tip: go outside peak lunch and dinner hours if you want to get a table. little hole in the wall AMAZING Thai!!! best I've ever had. legit, cheap, and delicious. (the Tom Kha rocked my socks.) This is some of the best Thai food I've ever had. Yes, it is really loud, but prices are fair and I haven't received bad service yet. But then again, I personally like to be left alone when I'm eating my meal, unless it is to fill my water or give me the bill :) The lines here are long; it's a popular place, but it's worth trying at least once. Everyone I've ever brought here loves it. I like this place but I also like the University District--I don't mind dodging the panhandlers, skaters and drug dealers to get to this little hole in the wall. &#160;If you don't like parking on the street, you had better go eat at University Village. Anyway, at Thai Tom, the counter is an "L" wrapped around the grill in the middle of the restaurant. Because this very popular restaurant is small, there is almost always a line outside the door if you get there after 5 pm. I think the Pad Thai is the best thing to order here. I have also had the soups--offered with and without coconut milk--and the eggplant. It is very HOT around the grill--the end spot on the short arm of the "L" is so hot because of flames periodically leaping off the grill that the one time I was seated there, I couldn't stand it for more than a few minutes. And I was a little worried that I might get burned. As soon as another spot opened up at the counter, I moved. The food here is also REALLY salty--I am thirsty for DAYS after I eat here. I'm not sure what this is about as I love Thai food and it doesn't have to be this salty. When they say five stars here, they mean it. I usually like my food four star spicy but at this place I am definitely a three star gal. Yes, the wait to eat here is atrociously long, and the service leaves a lot to be desired (they pretty much push you out the door the minute you take your last bite). That being said, the food has never disappointed me (it's probably the best Thai I've had in the area), and it will always hold a nostalgic piece of my heart as being THE place to go for Thai food during my days at UW. Take-out is a great option if you're in the area, or if you have the time to take it down to someplace like Gasworks park on a sunny day. Really great Thai food! &#160;We went at 3pm, and were lucky enough to be seated right away, but when we left there was a line outside. &#160;It is pretty crowded in the restaurant, but it was cool to see your food being cooked. &#160;I wouldn't recommend using the bathroom there if you can help it, but otherwise this place was great!
The atmosphere is the best thing about Thai Tom! I love this place tucked in on the Ave, if you haven't been- go now!Sitting at the bar is preferred since you get an up close and personal view of the food being made, just don't be surprised if they ask you to scooch down a few seats after other customers have moved on. The food is absolutely awesome, the service is decent for such a small cramped space, the music is always great. Thai Tom is really a Seattle must for me!Thai Tom is very spicy!! And they only take cash so be prepared, and enjoy :) Its amazing to watch this place revolve around the cook. Not appropriate for large parties.Try drinking your water past halfway, I bet you won't be able to. :)Their noodles are delicious, somewhat on the spicy side, like the 3 stars was burning my tongue, and I don't consider myself a wimp.I think they are great, the noodle dishes do taste slightly the same from one to the next but good non-the-less.made even better by biking to it. Finally went to Thai Tom yesterday, and while it couldn't possibly live up to the hype, it was pretty awesome. &#160;I was craving noodles and went with the phad thai, and it was probably the best phad thai I've ever had. &#160;Two stars here is definitely three stars anywhere else, though; I was skeptical when friends told me to order less than usual, but glad I followed their instructions. &#160;We also had an order of veggie spring rolls, and they were standard but tasty. &#160;One friend ordered the swimming rama and loved it. &#160;The other, who usually orders the swimming rama, went with the chicken and broccoli and was sad she didn't get her usual, but all was fixed with a side of peanut sauce.While the food is delicious, this place isn't without a few problems. &#160;It's seriously cramped-- don't try coming here with more than three people. &#160;Service was very slow yesterday, but apparently that's an anomaly. &#160;Cash only. &#160;Also, they keep the door propped open because so many people are waiting outside, but that makes it REALLY cold inside, which isn't entirely pleasant while you're waiting for your food. &#160;Their food safety violations are on the sketchy side.Delicious? &#160;Yes. &#160;Worth walking past a bunch of other Thai places and waiting in the cold for? &#160;Maybe. &#160;I think I'll go back, but probably not regularly. Like your food "caliente"? And I mean both temperature and spice. This place is amaaaazing - factor in the open flame, all the Thai food you can smell from a mile away, and delicious plates.Keep in mind if you're heading to this tiny hole-in-the-wall Thai goodness - you will not be able to get a table for more than 2 people. They do have a kitchen counter bar where you can sit, which seats approxmimately 8-9 people. Also, this is not a quiet, intimate place to dine in. Expect to hear metal clinking, pieces of food flying, and you might come out of there smelling like Thai seasoning and smoke. But let me tell you. It's SO WORTH IT!If you live/work/study in the area, it may be wise to get your Thai Tom to-go. But then again, you will miss out on the experience of making the Thai. The absolute best. Flavorful, and fun to watch them cook.Cozy, but not TOO cozy.Cash only, beware!Absolutely SPECTACULAR tom yum soup. The best in the city, hands down. Um delicious! Rich, delicious, flavorful, hot off the grill Thai food bam in your face... literally they cook it in front of your face. It's a tiny place that is super cool, not nice but has a cool feel to it - wood tables, small tables, most of the restaurant is a bar around the kitchen which is pretty amazing watching one person make a whole bunch of delicious meals.The panang curry is a must try, super flavorful and their portions are big! Also the fried tofu appetizer, the peanut sauce is delicious. Heard their pad-thai is just ok but get the panang curry if you like panang curry! Yes, you do have to wait.Yes, you will come out smelling like fried food.Yes, it is the opposite of a relaxing environment in which to eat.Yes, it is cash only.But the food is AWESOME and super cheap. &#160;It's the only pad thai I've had in Seattle that doesn't taste of ketchup. &#160;So just do it. CASH ONLY!!This place is the tiniest restaurant I've ever set foot in! &#160;They have a few stools around the bar/counter area where you can see the chef cooking your food - I'm guessing about 8 stools total. &#160;Then there are about 4-5 tables lined up against the wall, which creates a fire hazard because it nearly eliminates the walkway. &#160;This restaurant is best for parties of 2. &#160;Our group of 6 had to wait over 30 minutes to get seated - they pushed a few of the tables together to accommodate us. &#160;A waitress came and took our order while we waited around outside, so our food was ready by the time we got seated.I really loved the Tom Yum Kai soup I ordered and my husband loved his yellow curry. &#160;I'm always iffy about ordering curry at Thai restaurants because it seems to be more curry base than anything else. &#160;However, the yellow curry at Thai Tom really impressed us and was chock full of veggies and chicken!! &#160;It comes with jasmine rice.The rest of my friends got noodle dishes like pad thai and pad see ew and they were all pretty good. Tiny, crowded and loud, but surprisingly there's always a line outside. Why? Because the food's delicious. If you don't mind the wait, then Thai Tom is definitely worth trying! Thai Tom is still the best Thai place in Seattle, but minus one star for shady charges. They gave us the tab and the total appeared to be a good 20% more than it should have been. When we asked them why, they said tip was included. Okay, how bout you tell us if automatic gratuity was added in? And since when is it 20%, especially for a hole in the wall, definitely-not-five-star restaurant?Upside: My bf got five star spicyness and was sweatin up a storm. He said it was the spiciest food he has had in Seattle. I had heard a ton of hype about this place before, but was hesitant to give into it. A lot of stuff on the Ave seems to only be good for cheap college food, and not by any objective standard.I finally went here when my brother was in town recently. It had started snowing, which worked in my favor since we could actually get seats. (They also seemed to have turned off the music.) We were placed at the bar where we got to see the cook go at the woks. It was like he was trying to defeat a dragon by throwing as much food at it as possible. We got two appetizers, deep-fried tofu with peanut sauce and spring rolls. The spring rolls were tasty, if messy, and the peanut sauce was amazing. It was spicy and rich-- a perfect balance. The tofu itself could have maybe been seasoned more, but the sauce carried the dish well.We got an eggplant and ginger dish with chicken, as well as an order of spicy noodles for our main dishes. We asked for 5 out of 5 hotness. They actually listen when you ask for it spicy, instead of just giving you some wimpy American version of spicy. Make sure you're ordering what you really want. Both were delicious, though I liked the spicy noodles a bit more.I would definitely come back again, though I probably will stick to take-out, given that there's so often a line out the door. Remember that this place is cash-only-- they'll wait for you to go get cash, but you have to find an ATM nearby first. You have to be patient but the food is amazingly delicious and cheap! &#160;I am estimating that there are around 16 seats here and there is a wait every night of the week if you come at prime dinner time. &#160;I usually order either the spicy noodles or phad thai with tofu. &#160;Three stars is a good amount of spice. &#160;Trust me, this is coming from a girl who has been known to eat all the peppers off of a chili plant in under two weeks. &#160;The food is always fresh and flavorful, the aromas of the different spices and sauces hit your nose before you even take a bite. &#160;And then when you do, it's like whoa. &#160;This used to be my favorite Thai eatery but now that I have basically sampled most of the Thai food in Seattle, my views have changed. &#160;It still ranks up there on my list but depending on my mood and if I have any cash in my purse as it's cash only, I am perfectly content to go elsewhere. &#160;I love Thai Tom but it's not the be all and end all of good Thai food like everyone makes it out to be. One of the best Thai restaurant that I've been to. And also the only one that got this authentic feeling because of the interior of the place. I love watching the chef move so fast while cooking people's order. I also noticed the teamwork is awesome. Like they are in sync with each other. The chef never have to wait for the frying pan or whatever to be clean first, since it's always done cleaned and ready to be used by the time one order is done.It's a little bit hard to find this place if you never been here at all, since their logo wasn't exactly using a bright color or even neon-ed. And also parking can be a bitch too.. But that's expected since apparently this is a very busy area full of stores, restaurants, and college students.Their pad see iew and fried tofu with peanut sauce was yummyyy :D &#160;Definitely a must try if you're in the area! This place was always a favorite when I was attending UW and eating lunch and dinner on the Ave frequently. I decided to stop in last week for lunch since I happened to be in the area. Just as I remembered, the food was fantastic and so sooo flavorful. Just the right amount of spice for me (at 5 stars) without overwhelming the flavors of the dish. Two of my favorite are the phad thai (I swear this phad thai taste way better than the bland dish that most places serve) and their stir-fried ginger eggplant with chicken. Their curries are also amazing but I would advise against getting that unless you want to be known as "Curry Breath" at your place of work or in class. The only qualm I have with this place is that it is a teeny TEENY establishment with the open kitchen taking up almost half of the rectangular shaped room. Their small tables and chairs are smushed up together so you're up close and personal with the person sitting behind you and being jostled by the servers. Still the food is worth it as long as you don't exceed a party of 2. Oh and prepared for a bit of a wait. Craving some flavor intense, party in yo mouth thai dishes in a local hole-in-the-wall atmosphere? Bam! Thai Tom is your answer.It literally feels like a hole in the wall. I'd be interested to see the conversation the owners had when designing the floor plan for the space, since there is really no room for any movement or relaxed seating anywhere: "Let's put tables along this wall with small stools that creates just enough wiggle room for small petite thai ladies carrying heavy, hot meals to get through, and lets put the kitchen here and let hot oil and debris fall on these two people at the end of the bar. Great!" I actually thought this added to the ambiance and experience of restaurant and contributed to its dive-bar type atmosphere.The food is great as well. I ordered a bunch of things off the menu, and though its not the best thai food I've ever had, its definitely worth the price. We've been using the formula: # of people + 1 = total dishes ordered with at least half guys and we've all left satisfied at the least.And the chef that cooks dinner is thai, but looks mexican, who's been cooking the same recipes for 18 years. How can you go wrong with that? After much ranting and raving about it, I have received multiple updates that Thai Tom isn't what it was. I haven't been there but I can't leave that previous rating if good friends insist it's not - and I am sorry to hear it.Major frowns. Came on a Monday night when there was no ridiculous line. Solid tAsty food here. Thai salad with potato chips was really unique. Green curry chicken and garlic bean sprouts were great entrees too. Three star spiciness was just right.Definitely not fine dining so be prepared to have your clothes smell like Thai food but otherwise quality food. The guy in the harley-davidson jacket taking orders was pretty badass too. OMG! I can't believe I just found myself one of best Thai restaurant I had ever tired. Thank you yelp!I can't stress enough how good this place is!This place is totally hole in the wall and it's tiny! There was a wait when we got there during the lunch time, but no worried. We only had to wait about 10 minutes. Since the college is nearby, the restaurant really catered to the poor students in turn of being affordable. The chef amazed me too because being able to literally seat &#160;close to him I was able to watch him constantly cooking avg of 3-4 wok at a time. So quick and he makes it perfect everytime. De-lic-ious!!! Sooooo GOOOOOd!I am coming back here next time I come in town. I've been to every one of the Thai restaurants on the Ave. and although Thaiger Room has better Phad See-Uw, Thai Tom has the best Phad Thai BY FAR. Their deep-fried tofu appetizer has the most delicious peanut sauce that comes with it. NOM.This restaurant is great is there is only 1-2 people in a party, even 3 is pushing it a little bit. It's a very tiny restaurant and most people sit at the counter right next to where the chef cooks (dinner and a show anyone?).I've been when there's a long wait, and it does go by somewhat quickly. However, if you're hungry and you want Thai Tom during lunch and dinner hours, I would suggest ordering your food to-go.Two things to keep in mind:1.) Their stars for how spicy you want your food is only one to three. My friend and I, not knowing this, ordered our Phad Thai with 3 stars and literally could not handle it and we're pretty well-trained when it comes to spicy foods.2.) They don't accept checks or credit cards!! SO BE SURE TO BRING CASH!! Worth the wait!!!As a poor college student the prices at Thai Toms was appealing, however after eating there it has proved to be the best Thai and BEST Phad Thai around!! I always get Chicken Phad Thai and their salad with peanut sauce &amp; I swear its lays potato chips on top...sounds weird I know...but it's amazing!!! You will LOVE it!!Just a word to the wise, their spiciness runs on the HOT side. Oh and cash only!!! I love this place =D ... everytime I visit Seattle ... I have to come back to Thai Tom and I always order my two favorite dishes, which are swimming rama and tom yum soup .. and they were awesome ... The only complain I have was the rice portion .. I had to order 2-3 extra rice portion because it was not enough to eat with the soup ... and the place was tiny .. it was hard to sit and eat without touching &#160;the people next to me I can't even say how much I dig this place!From the quirky, awesome interior, the sheer tininess of it, the wooden menus to the fabulous food - this restaurant seriously rocks!Try the Cashew Chicken, the Tom Ka soup, and the Pad See Ew with Tofu. Unbelievably good!Sit at the counter and watch the chef. Big flames, smooth movements, incredible organization of a small space. All the dishes taste distinctly different - 5 stars!Great service, can get crowded, so go just before or after regular dinner hours. Bring cash. Not extremely comfy, kind of a third-world feel (especially the bath rooms). It's a real experience - try it!2 stars is plenty spicy a lot of the time.Again: Cashew Chicken, soup, Pad See Ew with Tofu!Rocks! There is something about hot food just off the grill. &#160;I "like* thai food, but not enough to seek it out, and it is often "cold" when it gets to the table, and it never stirs my soul. Thai Toms suffers from none of that. &#160;And I am convinced that spoonful of whatever that goes in the wok, is a highly addictive substance. &#160;It may not make you high, but it does something that makes my mouth water every time I want to go there. &#160;I ALWAYS get the same item. &#160;Chicken Panang. &#160;I also like the little deep fried bullet rolls, and I usually have water. &#160; The reason I get the same thing, is that it is SO good, and I am not even close to sick of it.No matter how few people there are on the ave, and how empty all the restaurants are, there is ALWAYS a line out of Thai Toms. &#160;Nothing else should recommend it more than that. &#160;It doesn't matter what day of the week, what time of the day, there is always a line. &#160;Because of that, and the noise of the restaurant this is solely about food, and getting it from the plate, into your gullet, and out the door. &#160; Where unbelievably all you can think about is your next trip back. Truly awesome. &#160;Really good, authentic food in an authentic setting. &#160;And by authentic, I mean, loud, cramped, and hot. &#160;Seating is limited and packed in there, and if you're lucky enough to get a seat at the counter be wary of flying food as it is literally prepared in front of you. &#160;Not the place for an intimate dinner for two, but if you want some great food in a really interesting spot, this is the place to be. First of all, this 5 star review is based on food, flavor, and quality. &#160;Thai Tom has the absolute best peanut sauce my wife and I have ever tasted! This place is a must and if you are visiting Seattle, you HAVE to try the food here. &#160;Is the place small and the decor funky? YES. &#160;Is the seating tight and the &#160;wait long just to get into the place? YES. &#160;Is the food as amazing as I am saying, hands down YES! &#160;While its true, there are some negative reviews for this place on yelp, if you read carefully, most reviewers criticizing non food items i.e. ambiance, decor, etc.. Food wise this place is great for cheap eats and fantastic flavor, go to Thai Tom, you will not be disappointed! Just wanted to add my "me too".This place is great. &#160;The Tom Kah is awesome! &#160;And in addition to good food, you get a show. &#160;The way those guys cook food is awe inspiring. &#160;It's a choreographed dance of food wonder.Words of warning. &#160;The food is fresh so it is also HOT! &#160;Unless your mouth is made of asbestos, maybe wait a few minutes before you dig in. &#160;Also, while they have a similar star rating to other restaurants (1-4, I think), they aren't shy with the spice. &#160;So if you normally order a 3, try out a 2 here. Yummy....As far as Thai food, this is probably the best I've eaten in Seattle. &#160;I usually stick with the Phad Thai and the Phad See Ew, both of which have great flavor and noodle texture. &#160;If you pull up a chair at the booth, you have a front row seat to watch a pretty slick chef in action, he works pretty fast, probably out of necessity cause he's the only one who's cooking and there's usually a line out the door.For those faint of heart, I don't suggest getting anything over 3 stars...they are pretty serious about their spice. &#160;I have this theory that the there's a positive correlation between how spicy a thai restaurant is and how "hole-in-the-wall"-y it is. &#160;This one fits the bill. There are a dozen Thai restaurants out there in Seattle, but Thai Toms offers something no one else can even compare to... the FOOD! it is seriously amazing! &#160;I've tasted pretty much every dish there and they are all amazing. This is real authentic Thai food. The peanut sauce is pretty much in its own league. Not to mention they are NOT conservative on the spice. So if your &#160;aren't too good with it, I'd consider ordering a star below what you are use to. PS This is place is barely the size of a walk-in closet, so large groups don't work so well. I like this place lot. A total hole in the wall and easy to pass by. Some co-workers told me about Thai Tom and I cringed (has been closed by the health department once maybe more, etc etc), but decided to tag along one day. There's usually a small line and you may have to wait 10-15 min, but a server always comes out and hands out menus. And the food is YUMMY. In the past when I thought of Thai food I thought "pad thai" &#160;and "yellow curry" which I don't like (how ignorant of me), BUT, this place has made me love Thai food and now I crave it all the time! The only thing I hate is that being a non-resident of the U-District means paid parking or lots of walking. The cleanliness of this place...not so much a fan of, but I've never gotten sick or seen any six-legged creatures or gotten questionable content in my food so I keep coming. I don't like that it's cash only, but everything is cheaper that way so it's understandable...just not always convenient. Yet again, a place that will serve spicy food to white people. &#160;Big plus. &#160;This place is about the food, not the ambiance. &#160;If you're looking for a roomy cozy place that you can have a big family meal and catch up on lost time for a couple of hours, go to Olive garden. &#160;Looking at this place from the outside for 2 seconds should tell you all you need to know about space and seating. &#160;dont like it? &#160;go somewhere else. &#160;There are 12 people behind you who will gladly take your place.Service was very fast and food was delicious. &#160;I asked for it spicy and thats what I got, which is more than I can say for most Seattle restaurants. &#160;The menu items, few though there are, are etched into planks. &#160;I approve. &#160;Especially as I assume they are intended to be used to smack people who whine about how small the space is.Wicked fast service. &#160;Delicious food. &#160;Cheap. &#160;And the added benefit of the free show the chefs put on when they set stuff on fire and juggle red hot woks around. This very small restaurant can accumulate long lines out the door! &#160;Make sure you wear warm clothes while waiting because it gets chilly in Seattle.Ambiance- When I first stepped in, there was a pungent smell that wasn't so pleasing.. but over time, I got used to it and forget that it was there. &#160;The place inside was very tiny and very dimly lit in the far corner of the room (which is where I sat). &#160;The Decor, the tables, and chairs were all very authentic! &#160;The chairs were very small stools and while sitting, it can be very crowded. &#160;The food is cooked in the same room as you, in other words, the cooks are not boarded off like most restaurants so you will smell like Thai Food. &#160;Food- I ordered the Padt Thai and Swimming Rama. &#160;They were both delicious and came with a scoop of rice on the side. &#160;The Padt Thai noodles were a bit on the harder side, but the tastes blended beautifully. &#160;The Swimming Rama is a very popular dish. &#160;It comes with meat and a very thick peanutty sauce over fresh spinach. &#160;Definitely worth the try and you might need extra rice for this saucy dish! &#160;I highly recommend the Swimming Rama. This is best place in town for thai. &#160;If you live here and haven't made it in you're going to kill yourself for not making it sooner. &#160;It was the first place I ate when I came for a visit several years ago and have made it a point to go once a week since moving here.Fried springrolls, chicken pad thai 3 stars, and a thai iced tea.I've eaten everything on the menu at this point, but that's my go to order.Just writing this review reminds me I haven't been there in a few days. &#160;See you down there.Cash Only!! This place is incredible. There is room for about fifteen people in this hole in the wall, so make sure you don't come with a big crowd. I would recommend no more than a group of three, otherwise you could find yourself waiting quite a long time.I had the pad see ew, and I loved it. They were mildly knowledgeable about gluten free needs, recommended this, and it was great. I also had no issues after eating it, so I can safely say it's gluten free.Better yet, it's cheap. But remember to bring cash! Oh my yes!!This was a full on dining experience, loved every moment. &#160;A friend &amp; I went to check it out this past Sunday. &#160;It was our 2nd choice as we found Araya to be closed, Thai Tom turned out to be way better &amp; super fun!!The place opened @ noon &amp; when we got there @ 12:20 there was a line out the door! (it is tiny) &#160;We ordered while in line &amp; in about 15min were seated @ the counter right in front of the cook. &#160;fun! &#160;We really felt like a part of the action watching the guy cook while awesome poppy dance music (beyonce) was blaring. &#160;After sitting there for five min. we got shuffled out of the hot seat to a table. &#160;Then our delicious food was presented. &#160;I got spicy noodle with tofu- YUM! &#160;so spicy &amp; the tofu was out of this world. &#160;Friend got panang curry with tofu. &#160;Again, FABULOUS! &#160;The tofu was so crisp &amp; the curry sauce rich &amp; tasty. &#160;Service was great considering the place was slammed &amp; everyone there seemed to be having a great experience. &#160;I know we did! &#160; &#160;I'm going back soon for the bathing rama, it looked off the hook amazing.You'd better go... now! Best Thai restaurant in Seattle. The chefs move so fast over the woks that they are blurry. The food is so delicious that after eating here you will probably be disappointed in every other Thai restaurant you ever visit. Their Tom Kha Soup should be a regulated drug. You have to pay with cash and it can be a tight squeeze if your party has more than 2 people. Best thai place I've ever eaten at ... as if the crowd of people waiting to be seated each night was no give away. &#160;The place is really cozy and the atmosphere is awesome. &#160;The kitchen is right in sight so you get to see your food being made too.Also, the service is pretty impeccable, You'll never have an empty cup of water. &#160;My only warning: when this place serves spicy food, they mean it. &#160;Don't try being a hero and getting a 5/5 spiciness, you might leave with a few burns. Tom Thai is probably the BEST thai restaurant in Seattle. The food is delicious and the fact that you can watch the chef cook is awesome. This place is a bit small and is always crowded so you should get there right when they are open. You can read about the food I ate at my blog: http://www.ricendine.com&#8230; Back again and well worth it. Get a seat at the counter so you can watch the magic unfold right in front of you. Make your dish a 5 (on the one to five scale) and your eyes will water from the fiery goodness, so be sure to order a thai ice tea to help with that. Enjoy! Overrated. Long lines, overpriced, overly spicy food, no seating. Pretty good food, though. Lots of other places I'd rather go on the Ave to get Thai, though. Thai Tom is one of the better Thai restaurants I've tried anywhere. The food was so rich in flavor. I ordered the Tom Kha Gai (coconut soup) and Pad Thai. The Tom Kha Gai soup was a perfect balance between savory, sour and sweet. It tasted like Tom Yum (or tamarind) soup except with a coconut soup base. The taste of the Pad Thai was really good but the noodles were a little on the tough side. Some of my friends liked it but I wasn't a big fan. One of my friends ordered the Swimming Rama (chicken in peanut sauce) and it was one of the best things I've tasted in a long time. The sauce was thick and rich, rich, rich with flavor. You'll definitely want to pair it up with some rice, which conveniently is included with every entr&#233;e including noodles! I also ordered a Thai Iced Tea that had a little more sugar than it did half-and-half. I would have preferred a little more of the latter but it's still good. Thai Tom was teeny tiny but they managed to fit our group of 9 into a table. Granted that we were knee-to-knee, it was still a great dining experience. The food was flavorful, prices were decent ($7.49/entr&#233;e), service was good and portion sizes were large enough for leftovers. If I lived in the UDub area of Seattle, I would indubitably be a regular. Seiously good, inexpensive Thai food. &#160;This is a tiny little dinner in the U district. &#160;Simple, traditional, fantastic thai food. &#160;Order off a wood menu and choose your spice "heat" level 1-5. &#160;2 is hot! &#160;If you sit at the counter you get the priviledge of the heat from the open fire in the kitchen as well. &#160;It's only 3 feet away. Three things come to mind. Great Thai, unreal hole-in-the-wall cool and dirty at the same time must do experience, and unpredictable iPod mix selection to croon you while you dine. Food is quick and always great. I'm slim and thankfully have a fast metabolism. My go-to dishes are always cashew chicken with extra broccoli, swimming rama chicken and pad thai chicken - all 3 stars. Yes, I get all three in one sitting every time I go. I am particularly in love with the Pad Thai. And I go weekly I am that loyal to Thai Tom. I am a moth to flame for anything spicy and when I have shimmy shimmy cooking - the skinny dude who doesn't ever sweat despite being inches away from the stove flames for hours on end - I go with 3 stars to save myself from having to reach for the Tums. But he also knows me and he doesn't discount ;). Let's just say his 3 stars is equivalent to 5 stars at other Thai (and Indian) places. Music can be Thai opera mix one time, Jay-Z rap and R&amp;B another, and 80s mix yet another time. At least they're democratic about who in the kitchen gets to do their mix. Every college town has a great Thai restaurant and UW is no exception. Just up the Ave, this place has intense charm; water dripping from the ceiling into buckets, food made right infront of you, always packed--it's amazing. Great price, great for take out (great to save in your fridge for the next when you come back from a party.)Why aren't you at Thai Toms yet? I have to disagree with other reviewers here who say Thai Tom serves authentic Thai food. I spent a month in Thailand and nowhere did I come across food this good and that's saying a lot. The cooks here have come up with recipes that I am convinced are not traditional but rather superior. They could probably open a 5 star restaurant in Bangkok and be very successful. The food is that good. Yes there are downsides to the space Thai Tom is in but the reviewers who've given them 1 lousy star because they thought it was too small, too dark or too noisy obviously have never set foot outside the Seattle city limits. The Yelp overall 4 star rating is probably justified due to the location and service but I'm still going to give them 5 stars for the most amazing Thai food in Seattle. Hands down the best Thai food I've ever had. &#160;I've been coming to this place for 8 years now and am never disappointed. &#160;Sure it's tiny, doesn't have the best decor, and the music is pretty random, but the food is delicious. &#160;If you want spicy this place is the spiciest. &#160;I would suggest going down one star from what you usually get at other Thai restaurants, because this place will have you reaching for your water after every bite if your not careful. &#160;If you can try to sit at the bar, the tables are kind of small and it's always fun to watch them cook the food. &#160;You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but I always get either Chicken Phad Thai or Swimming Rama (drool the peanut sauce). This place is awesome! &#160;Cheep, fast food (once you get in) and an authentic thai kitchen feel. &#160;The blaring Metallica was a little annoying during my last visit, but completely tolerable once I got that delicious food. mmmm, peanut sauce. this goes down as the best thai food i've ever had. as for the reports of roaches.... i haven't seen one, but i'm willing to risk it.i recommend the swimming rama with tofu, the thai salad (potato chips on a salad?! they somehow make it work) and the garlic/beansprouts/tofu dish (can't remember the name). Great thai food with a matching atmosphere but the prices are high, the place is always crowded and there are other places near by with even better thai food for cheaper and in a less crowded environment. My advice: get a spiciness rating 1 star lower than what you might get somewhere else. &#160;The food is top notch, but last time I was there everyone at the table was red and sweaty by the end of their meal. We took a bus to get there from downtown when we were visiting Seattle. It was very easy to get to and we were seated promptly. The best thai food I've ever had. Since eating at Thai Tom, I haven't found any other Thai food place that's even close to this place. My favorite Thai restaurant in the city! &#160;The 5 stars are for the food and the ambiance. &#160;Yes the ambiance. &#160;I know, it's a hole in the wall --but that is the charm here. &#160;You will wait forever in the rain. &#160;You will sit cramped at a small table or at the kitchen counter so close the the cook you might get burnt. &#160;This is part of the awesomeness that is this place.Oh yeah, and the food is stunningly good...and what a price! &#160;How good? &#160;I don't like broccoli, and I can not STOP eating their spicy broccoli dish. &#160;I'm serious. &#160;I got it on a dare once (cause I usually get many of their other great dishes)...and now I can't stop getting it. &#160;It is amazing. Dear lord, does the cook work hard for his money. I was in there at 4:00 on a saturday and the man didn't stop moving the entire half-hour or so I was seated, either spectating on the fiery cooking or eating my delicious noodles. Poor Man's noodles? Yes indeed. It did seem like they had one waitress too many for the size of the place (tiny) but they smiled and kept my water full while serving delicious food at an entirely reasonable price. And seriously, that is my only complaint. Too many waitresses. Ha. Well done Thai Tom. My experience at Thai Tom can only be described in one word and its AMAZING. Had lunch here with some friends and had a great time. The food was delicious but the work of the chef was what made this time mind-blowing!As the 5 of us put our orders in, the chef walks to his little kitchen and begins to work. You'd think it would take a while to get 5 dishes out but think again! The guy lays out 4 woks and a small pan onto the small 6-burner stovetop and a couple of splashes of oil later, the show begins! Some sauce here, a handful of noodles there, and a toss of veggies and BAM!! 7 minutes later he lays out all of our dishes in front of us! This guy is a real pro and knows what he's doing in the kitchen.I had phad thai chicken and thai iced tea and i have to say it was some of the best thai food i've ever had! The noodles were cooked perfectly and not over-sauced. The iced tea was the perfect compliment to this meal and quite refreshing! The only thing that i didn't like was the texture of the rice that comes with the noodles but the magic in the kitchen made up for it!If you want some real deal tasty thai food Thai Tom is the place to go. The chef goes hard in the kitchen and the food tastes great!! This place ROCKS! &#160;This was one of the places i used to frequent when i was at the U and still one of the best places out there for Thai food. &#160;Too bad its stuck in a place with little street parking and small venue. &#160;I would say that the Thai food is amazing. &#160;I usually get the Drunken Noodles to go and that thing is so hot when i get it, i usually burn my hands holding the take out box. &#160;The food is on the spicier side but extremely flavorful. &#160;The service is smoking fast (five to ten minutes when theres no que) and the staff usually pretty friendly (when theres not too many customers). &#160;Beware the crowds though. &#160;They will swamp that place in no time. My son attended the university here for five years and this was our favorite place to eat. &#160;Next to the Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas, I think this is the best street style Thai food in America. &#160;Everything is made to order. &#160;Simple and brilliantly executed. &#160; I love the Panang Curry and spicy soups. &#160;Perfect to take the edge off Seattle's grey weather. Simply the best thai food you'll ever had, nothing more and nothing less. Go for the swimming Rama or the spicy noodles. Tom I really hope you read these because I love you man but what happened tonight was just messed up so I have to remove a couple stars from my last review.There was a cockroach crawling on our table, and instead of freaking everyone in the place out I went up to one of the waitresses and whispered it to them that I didn't want to upset people but there were some roaches crawling around. She came and grabbed it with a napkin before my pops and his friend could see it. My girlfriend didn't believe me and then all of the sudden another pops up and runs right along the table only for me to summon the other waitress to smother it with a napkin before anyone notices. Now I've been in enough 3rd world countries for that to not freak me out too much but if the others there would have seen it all hell would have broke lose. I expected to maybe get some gratitude for how I handled it by at least knocking off an appetizer or a bit off the bill but shoot I didn't even get a thank you let alone something off the bill. But nope a straight up $69 plus my dad was paying and left a fat tip. The whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth though because I was really trying to help you guys out (come to find out this has been an ongoing problem and restaurant has been shut down before because of it) yet rather then show some thanks or appreciation it was the regular, hurry up and pay so we could go so we get get more people in here. Maybe that's why this is the first time I didn't see a line.... If you doubt anything I say just ask your waitresses if 12/22/10 they didn't kill two roaches for a party of four. I could have been a punk at just called the health dept and it would have cost you a lot more then some pad thai. I hope they relay this to you man cuz I'm worried that unless stuff starts getting handled better it's going to catch up to you in a bad way. this place is always packed! but it's worth of the waiting...the service was quite fast and on-time as well. this is an open kitchen place, so don;t get distracted by the super nice smell from the food they cook right under your nose. &#160;the tom yam is marvelous. fried rice, pad thai, fried tofu, well basically go there couple of times then you can decide which one is your fave. try to come after 8pem if you want to avoid the line This is still the best Thai restaurant I have been to Thai couple times it's really nice to eat some food taste the same feel like u r in Thai and the price is nice too just a small advice cuz they don't have lots of tables so go there earlier or on weekdays better than weekends,try their pai Thai I love it :) Walking near the University area, we found this highly rated place on Yelp. It's a really small restaurant, usually more suited for takeout, so our group of 6 had to wait about 15 minutes. That's where we had the best tasting falafels next door!! Anyways, I ordered the swimming thing, which was most noted on Yelp. I'm not sure what to think of it. It tasted okay with rice, but it was just weird. I guess I'm not used to pad thai, panang, pad see ew, etc. However, my friends really like this place. Panang Curry just get it and thank me later. &#160;I used to live in Seattle and was able to get great food like this all the time but now being in Arizona it's not an option anymore. &#160;So I am grateful when I stop in to a spot like this and the food blows me away with how good it is. &#160;Hopefully before I head back to AZ I can stop by again. Been here once -- New Year's Eve. &#160;Ordered a pad-thai to-go with a spiciness level of 2-3, for a total of $8.75 ($7.25 + tip + tax). It includes white rice. Quantity was comparable to a chipotle burrito bowl. The wait was around 10 minutes. I'm generally more tolerant of spiciness than most of my friends, but I sorta wish I ordered a tiny bit less spicy in order to fully appreciate the flavour. Oh, and please squeeze the lime onto your pad-thai -- it completes the sweet tangy dish perfectly.Though this restaurant is very cramped, noisy, dim, and a little more than I'd like to spend (poor college student here), I give them 5 stars because of their amazing chef, the kind waitress who thanked me by name despite the chaos of people, and how amazingly well this business managed to utilize and their space. It is TINY, and afaik, the food is bomb. The owners work hard and I cannot imagine anything they could do differently to improve their food or their restaurant atmosphere. It's like a miniature escape from university avenue to Thai Tom's own little universe, loved by all who enter it. Hehe. Still need to try their curry and thai tea. :)btw: expect to walk out of the restaurant smelling like it. :P Best thai in Seattle! I go here every time I visit. Because the place is small, there is usually a line but it moves quickly, as do the cooks behind the bar. THE BEST! Best Thai food in Seattle with the long lines to prove it. Flavors are divine and the open kitchen to watch the chef cooking 5-6 dishes at once. It's a stereotypical "hole in the wall" gem. The Green Curry is exceptional. I love the cashew chicken, but trade the chicken for more vegetables,and the hubby loves the pad thai. Best time to go is around 3:00pm as this is a busy place since the food is so delicious!! We wanted to see what all the hype is about so we came here for a quick lunch while we were visiting Seattle. &#160;There are only a total of 10 to 15 seats in this restaurant but the service is fast so the wait isn't too bad. &#160;The spring rolls were very average. The waiter told us that their spring rolls are very good and that they only make limited amounts of them per day so we gave it a try. I've had much better spring rolls at other Vietnamese restaurants. &#160;We also ordered the garlic pepper chicken. This dish was delicious and had very good flavor. &#160;The prices are very affordable. Overall, the food is solid but I think all the Yelp reviews hyped it up too much for me. very authentic thai restaurant. service is very fast. &#160;the waiter is fun and will show your table a great time. i would recommend this to anyone wanting to try some thai food in seattle.the veggie roll is excellent, the crab wonton (crab rangoon) is great, and the spring roll is bite sized, also great, but not as unique.the chicken panang is amazing, the duck curry is my absolute favorite, this is a must. &#160;the beef with thick noodles are also amazing.i am only visiting seattle but if i lived here, this will no doubt be one of my favorite/regular spots for thai. My mouth starts to water just thinking about Thai Tom's delicious dishes, all of which are served in funky leaf-shaped plates. The restaurant is teeny, only seating 15 people or so, but the food is worth the wait for a table. If you're lucky enough to sit at the counter you can watch the cook whip up wok after wok of Thai food over giant flames and see every ingredient that goes into your dish. The phad thai is tasty, but the swimming rama is orgasmic, mostly due to the peanut sauce. Everything on the menu is $7.95 and the portions are quite reasonable - not so big that you stuff yourself, but not so small you feel cheated. I have never seen a dissatisfied customer in the place. The only reason I didn't give Thai Tom 5 stars is their cash only policy, which seems ludicrous in this day and age. Do people even carry cash any more? I love those "hole-in-the-wall" places because they always turn out to have the best food, great flavor, and the cheapest prices. I think if I had gone to UW I definitely would have frequented this place on more than one occasion, considering thai food was a part of my weekly diet in college I would have been one of the many people standing in line out side of the hallway that is Thai Toms. Because seriously this place is so tiny that looking in I was wondering where had my friend Curtis taken us for lunch? Why had we passed 4 other thai restaurants on our up-hill climb to this tiny place that might end up having us eat our lunch out on the side walk? I loved that the hostess took our orders while we were still standing outside, on what apparently was a "slow" day. I ordered the big noodles, based on my friend's recommendation, and my boyfriend ordered the yellow chicken curry. The things I love most about this place:1. The rankings for spiciness on a 1-5 scale. I ordered mine at a 4, only because we were getting a tour of the campus after and I didn't want to have to stop every 5 minutes as a result of drinking my body weight in water. I think for me, the 4 was perfection. It had the perfect amount of heat, yummy veggies, and the noodles were delicious, so much so that I requested a fork because it looked too damn good to sit there struggling with chop sticks. 2. The prices. Seriously $6 for my meal that left me full for the entire day. Amazing and something that you definitely don't see any more. I think the next time I actually have Thai food as good as here is when I'm in Thailand. That's also the only time the prices will be cheaper too. I'm glad I didn't have to brave the crowds, but I could definitely see how this place is worth the wait! I'm eating leftovers of my pad thai right now while writing this! I came to UW to visit a friend for her birthday and we wanted something to eat for lunch to celebrate...she was in the mood for some noodles and suggest that we try thai tom because her brother said it was really good....and he wasn't lying. First thing you notice is this place is super squished and packed like sardines but the best food always comes from hole in the wall places right? Their ingredients are fresh and delicious! Portions are generous and they serve it right in front of you! They are quick to make it and service is pretty friendly if you are okay with getting bumped and having arms and elbows in your face when being served.....but I don't really mind..they're trying to make the best of what they got. What I appreciate most about this place is that they work hard to deliver make every plate. It is cash only but who cares? Be prepare to wait at least 15-10 minutes before you get seated. The restaurant only holds maybe 15 people max. Every entree comes with rice. The fried tofu appetizer is good, the sauce that comes with it is superb. The noodle dishes are ok.If you can get a seat in the bench and watch the chef cook... it's impressive. He holds the secret to all the secret ingredients inside every dish. I have eaten here about 5 times, which is as often as I've been to Seattle since I discovered it. &#160;This is far and away the best Thai food I've ever had, and I've eaten Thai in a lot of metro cities and cook a lot SE Asian cuisine at home.Yes, it is small, loud, and a bit seedy, but who cares. &#160;This place is all about the food. &#160;The Panang Curry, Swimming Rama, and Spicy Noodles are out of this world. &#160;You just cannot get that char flavor from the BTU's on a home stove, nor will you ever get the flavors that they get from their mystery spice/sauce layout. &#160;Yes, the food is a bit on the spicy side. &#160;I love the endorphin burn, but I have to order a 3 out of 5 to eat more than a few mouthfuls. &#160; YUM!I've never seen any sign of cockroaches or other vermin reported by others, but If I ever should happen to find a cockroach on my table, I would give it a noodle or two so that it would be as happy as I while I ate my meal. &#160; And we would both be smiling. Best Thai food... Ever. You are bound to think about how good Thai Tom is every time you eat Thai food for the rest of your life. This will always be my favorite restaurant in all of Seattle! Try the Tom Kah and Tofu with Peanut Sauce. Really awesome and cheap thai food Probably the best Thai in Seattle, and Thai is my favorite food. &#160;It may take you a long time to get a seat in this TINY hole in the wall, but you will feel like you are in Thailand once you do. &#160;Such good food, great prices, amazing flavors. &#160;Great service, they will move you through fast, this place is as good as it gets. Holy shit this is fucking delicious I have never written a review so soon after my meal but this is seriously delicious I would give it 6 stars if I could. I didn't apply to University of Washington but now I wish I did because this is seriously good. If there's such a thing as a risky dining experience, then you'll get it at Thai Tom. The 3 I'm giving is really an average of many 1's and 5's. There's times when the food is just excellent. I like the fried eggplant dish and I appreciate the flavors of the Pad Thai, particularly because they don't put ketchup in it. The environment also has its flare as you can literally sit at the counter and watch the cooks make your meal. The fire of the grill is right in front of you as the chef mixes all the spices skillfully together. That being said, there's a flip side to being able to see everything. Specifically, on two occasions, I've seen a long stick bug and a cock roach crawl across the table right in front of me and the people I was with. Needless to say, all three of these people refuse to come back. I'll confess, this place really is sketchy, and I'm convinced the place is seldom cleaned, if ever. I'm afraid to look at the King County food inspection report. However, the food is pretty good, and piping hot. You can almost feel the fire in the food. I gave it a second chance after the first bug incident. However, I'm going to have a hard time going back, particularly because the lines are often long and the prices continually increase. I have been in love with Thai Tom and have gotten many people hooked ever since my first visit as a Freshman at UW. This place is like my personal recreational drug. I don't go to Thai Tom very often because I'm never on the Ave anymore. But once in a while, I will go out of my way to indulge myself with some kick ass chicken phad thai. I have tried several other dishes on their menu but I always go back to the chicken phad thai. And it is the BEST phad thai I have ever tasted. So much flavor in the dishes. So amazingly spicy yet is not overpowering. I also love sitting at the counter by the stove in the winter, enjoying the warmth and the fantastic smell, and watch Tom cooking up those dishes like Speedy Gonzales. Even my dear mother likes the food and she HATES restaurant foods. The servers are nice and friendly. I never had any issue with their services. Tom actually asked me how my food tasted himself couple times when I sat by the counter. It is a hole in the wall so call them and order take outs if you have more than 3 people. The only thing that kind of annoys me is that they don't take plastic, which is inconvenient for me because I never have cash. But this does not stop me from giving Thai Tom 5 bright and shiny stars and going back for more phad thai. There's a Bank of America across the street and Thai Tom is oh so worth the 30 second walk. Awesome food and great experience. It's the poor mans Benihana &#160;because everything is cooked right in front of you. Havn't had anything I didn't like there. It get's packed so eating at off peak hours here is a good idea and worth it Best Thai in Seattle. The place is small but the wait staff and the chefs know how to efficiently make use of it. It's always busy but they can usually get you seated fairly quickly but there is always some waiting involved. If I am in a hurry I go next door and get a gyro but whenever I want really good Thai I go here. Honestly the best gyro and Thai in Seattle are right next to each other, sadly they are in the U-District. The Ave is the most annoying place to walk and these two places are the only reason I ever venture on that forsaken street. The food here is wonderful. I have never had a bad eating experience. The staff are always doing something so there is little chit chat and BS, which is nice. It's always fun to see a chef busting his balls for busy restaurant. The Pad Thai and Swimming Ramma are perfect servings that leave you completely satisfied. I have learned that it doesn't matter what temperature of hotness you request cause it's always going to be a medium-high spiciness. Don't like spicy food? Grow up and learn to deal with it. I did. So delicious! If you are cold and in the mood for some soup, get the Tom Kah with rice. &#160;Be prepared for a little wait, and bring cash. &#160;I love this place! Great food, quick service, and a good atmosphere excuses the lack of seating for this hole in the wall Thai restaurant. Definitely one of the best places to go for Thai food in the greater Seattle area. Thai Tom is great thai food. The swimming rama is the best. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because it is impossible to get into. It is so small and there's always a wait. Two words, Swimming Ramma. &#160;Imagine a bed of rice covered by leaves of spinach, then a meat of your choice (preferably chicken), and finally all drenched by delicious peanut sauce and with crushed peanuts too. &#160;I've always believed that the best places to eat in Seattle are the small places that are hard to find, hole-in-the-walls if you will. &#160;This is one of them. &#160;Now I know there are plenty of Thai places to eat around the area but the difference between those places and Thai Tom's is one thing, ketchup. &#160;Most people don't know it but ketchup is used often in Thai restaurants because it's cheap and it's a substitute for the their tangy spicy food. &#160;Trust me I've tried most of these places and I can tell they cook ketchup into their Pad Thais. &#160;I'm not gonna point out names but &#160;I will say this, Thai Tom's does not use ketchup. &#160;As proof they cook right in front of you and you can see all the ingredients too, that's quality right there.Another dish that's fantastic is their Pad Thai, that's all I gotta say. &#160;And be careful on their spice level, 1-5 stars, 5 being the hottest. &#160;Other than that I enjoy eating there, they're always nice to me and it's actual good food. &#160;Don't complain that it's too cramp or crowded it's a hole-in-the-wall, you can always take out after all.
I've eaten more Thai food than I think is healthy or normal, so when a friend proclaimed that I "absolutely HAVE to try this place...it's a-mazing", I was a litlte ambivalent. I mean, how good could it possibly be? And more importantly, how is this hole-in-the-wall Thai place any different from the thousands of other Thai restaurants out there? Regardless, I obliged her and went.First of all, I'd like to emphasize that it truly is TINY. They can't physically handle more than 15-20 diners at a time, so obviously there was a wait. I got there around 6:30pm on a Friday evening, so the crowd of people gathered outside was expected. A waitress was going around and getting names and pretty much telling everyone that the wait was 15-20 minutes. Yeah, right.Turns out, she was right on the money. 20 minutes later, I heard my name being shouted down the sidewalk and she handed me a wooden menu to inspect as they readied our spots. The menu (which was half faded away as it was written by paint on a slab of wood) was simple and pretty much standard Thai fare. All entrees are $7.49+tax, regardless of what it is. I went safe with Pad Thai with tofu and veggies (I am after all, vegetarian), as I tend to judge new Thai places based on this staple. We were then led inside and seated at the bar-type area next to the cooking station. Flames were shooting in every which direction, sizzling hot pots flung around and sauces squirted from what seemed like one end of the room to the other. Dinner and a show? I was in love already.The food finally came and although I had ordered a 3 (out of 5), it was quite spicy. Granted I'm Indian and my spice-tolerance level is pretty high, but I was definitely feeling it after a few bites. That's what the dollop of white rice they served with it and the thai iced tea was for, right? I worked and sweated (since we were next to the flaming grills) through it and it was heaven in my mouth. Yes, definitely live up to the hype. Best part was that it was the most unique version of pad thai I'd ever had; thinner noodles, slightly different spice combo, etc.Overall, I'd say I loved it. Yes the service was a bit iffy as everyone was completely frazzled, and they tried to rush us a bit as the line outside grew longer, but the food was so amazing that I guess it didn't matter. And it's a cash-only joint, so be prepared. I'll definitely be back at this place. First of all, from reading the other reviews, we apparently got extremely lucky as far as the wait was concerned. &#160;We showed up at a few minutes after twelve on a Saturday, and we were pointed to one of two empty tables right away. &#160;I guess that's very much not the norm, and you can see why the second you walk into the place: there's just no space here. &#160;Do NOT try and come here with more than a couple of friends; three, maybe four people can be fit at a table if you squeeze, but if you go over that, you may be in trouble. &#160;As far as the food was concerned... this place deserves every accolade it's gotten on Yelp. &#160;It's easily the best Thai food I've ever had. &#160;The peanut sauce was incredible, the spicy noodles dish was really good as well, heck, even the rice tasted delicious. &#160;But be warned: SPICY MEANS SPICY here. &#160;I love spicy food and have a pretty high tolerance, so I ordered a four, and it was just right for me... which means way over what most people will enjoy. &#160;Honestly, if you're thinking you want your food good and spicy, you should probably stick with the three (which won't disappoint), and upgrade on subsequent visits if that's not enough for you. &#160;As far as service is concerned, we didn't have a particularly bad experience, though we were asked to change tables about five minutes after we sat down to make room for a group of three that had just shown up. &#160;Still, the water glasses were (blessedly!) kept full and the food got to us at a pretty good pace, so it's certainly not going to cost this place a star.Overall, definitely a place you should visit if you like Thai food, and worth the trip out to UW campus, even if you're just planning on eating and heading back home. I love me some Thai food, and Thai Tom's is a great little hole in the wall place in the U-District. &#160;Their dishes have great flavor and and always super spicy. &#160;Sometimes too spicy for my taste. &#160;The past few times I've ordered a 2 star dish with it being the hottest mother effin' thing I've eaten. &#160;Almost hotter than most food I had in Thailand. &#160;Order 1 star below what you think you can handle! &#160;Or be prepared to breath fire for the next 2 days.The wait can be insane, so order take-out if you can.. &#160;Though you won't necessarily get it when they tell you to come by. Food - A Atmosphere - DService - FThey have some of the best thai food around, but they are so rude and the restaurant is small, dirty, hot and they play very loud music. &#160;Oh, and they have cockroaches! &#160;They also force you to tip. So I have opted for to go orders. &#160; My favorite dishes there are pad thai, and yellow curry. The following account details a real or a really imagined conversation between the user and her food. This should not be considered an endorsement of talking to one's food, particularly if one's food is in a bag and you are on a bus and haven't showered for at least two days. ME: La la la. I am so great. Yay, me. My birthday was fun, my friends are the tits, and now I am in Seattle and it is quite lovely. Life can be hard, but someone's got to power through it. And my friends told me to try . . . a Thai restaurant? As if my hometown doesn't have as many Thai restaurants as it does trustafarians. Why would they do this?THAI TOM: Trust them. Oh, the hell with them. Trust me.ME: Um, I don't know if you've noticed, Thai Tom? But I'm kind of a big deal and I have places to be that have beers with my name on them. You're going to tell me that this tiny, steamy hole in the wall is going to open my eyes to uncharted frontiers in the area of Thai food consumption?THAI TOM: That is what I'm telling you. I know what I'm talking about. Plus, I think you'll find that as soon as you drop by, watch the flames soar upwards from the stove as the chef yanks a pot from the burner and pours its contents into a leaf-shaped plate, all in one fluid motion, you'll agree with me. You'll agree with all of them.ME: I think I know what I think, Thai Tom. But if you insist, I don't want to be rude.*One spicy noodle helping later*ME: I. Oh. My. I kind of think I should smoke a cigarette now.THAI TOM: Told you. Consider the humble pie a freebie, compliments of the chefs.ME: I can't decide if my tongue is still on fire or if all the tastebuds on it are asleep for the night. THAI TOM: Yeah, I hear that a lot. So who's the tits now?ME: Well. I will let you know after you pencil me in for panang curry tomorrow night. The BEST Thai Restaurant on the Ave!Pros- food is delicious!- cheappppppp, I didn't cry because my wallet was significantly lighter - service is quick- food is tasty- YUMMY in MY TUMMYCons- usually a 20 min wait- small space, not for the claustrophobic- like most restaurants on the ave... CASH ONLY, no checks, no cards, no hos, no gold.My suggested meal:- Appetizer: Fried Tofu Dish... you will love the peanut sauce and want to drink it from the dish- Entree: Swimming Rama with Shrimp.... OMG my stomach is growling from thinking about how delicious it was.One word: GOOOOOOOOO! Phad Thai was *super* hot! I'm pretty sure we ordered a 3 star for spicy but it felt more like a 6! Yowza!Cramped quarters. Service was perfunctory. I wasn't impressed. The best Thai food in Seattle, hands down. &#160;For all the nay-sayers: go to some chain or other relatively mediocre place with nice decorations and pay with your credit card so I don't have to wait so long to eat! &#160; The teeny little place and rushed service reminds me of being in Thailand, it's rushed, crowded, hot and the air is filled with chili powder and tamarind. &#160;I am always disappointed when I step outside and remember that I'm in the U district and not Bangkok. &#160;With 5 small tables and 10 counter seats, you can watch and be mesmerized by the chef's dance as he navigates the obligatory collection of Thai sauces, noodles, veggies and meat between woks on the 5 hot burners with grace and speed. &#160;The tango between the cook and the assistant handing ingredients and dirty woks back and forth without missing &#160;a step is equally impressive.My favorite dish is the steamed mixed vegetables with tofu and peanut sauce, 3 stars! &#160;Pad Thai is also amazing. &#160;They don't mess around with the spice here so watch out, I've seen the glowing red of a 5 star pad Thai, it's not for the faint of heart.It's dangerous to sit at the counter if you're too hungry as they plate each dish right there in front of you. &#160;I've been tempted more than once to grab a piece of broccoli off newly plated dish when the cook turns his head to check the order on the ticket.Oh, and don't even try to figure out when your dish is served onto one of those cute banana leaf plates. &#160;They prepare about as many dining-in plates as they prepare take-out dishes. &#160;Just when you think it HA S to be your turn, a to-go order with six dishes gets served up.Truly a gem on the Seattle Thai food scene. &#160;If you're lucky enough to get Tom at the stove, prepare your taste buds to have each of their little minds blown! It's been a long since I've patronized Thai Tom's, and today we decided to pay them a visit for lunch.The space: It's loud, it's small, it's hot.The servers did a good job. I don't think I'll ever understand how someone can run around a tiny/hot/loud space all day and still retain some sanity. So... props to them.The food was quite good. The Thai Salad w/ peanut sauce had lettuce, spinach, and POTATO CHIPS in it. I was a bit bummed about the lack of of tomatoes or cucumbers or anything else, but I thought the potato chips were a nice surprise and added a very interesting texture to the salad. The Thom Kha soup was tasty and had plenty of vegetables and tofu in it.I don't think I'll ever get take-out from here (last time I tried the food was pretty bad) and apparently I've done a great job avoiding the cockroaches (mentioned in various reviews), so.... as long as I keep that up... this place is worth four stars (to me).Note: This is a CASH ONLY joint. (Thankfully there's a BoA, Chase, BECU, WSECU and Wells Fargo within several blocks so you can hopefully avoid those pesky ATM fees.) This place offers some pretty tasty Thai food.However, this place is not a comfortable place to eat, especially if they seat you at the bar next to a wall crawling with roaches. Note the plurality of the last word in the preceding sentence. I ate all of my food, while maintaining close eye contact with creepy crawlies to my right. I was unable to move much to my left because someone was sitting uncomfortably close to me on my left. I imagine this place would be more comfortable if you order a table in lieu of the wall seat I possessed. However, I think I can find some Thai food of similar quality without the detriments I have previously mentioned. Went here for the first time today we were there about 10 minutes before they were supposed to open, but we waited 20 minutes at least as they didn't open on time as the people working here had to eat and have a Cigarette before they could open that is not acceptable in my eyes, you have posted your hours of business then open on time and allow your self time to prep and have a smoke break, I spent 6 years in the kitchen as a cook so I understand but you get your food and breaks when you can, not as you see fit your customers are paying your billsalso I had to listen to my partner bitch as you didn't open on time, but by the crowds we saw you really don't care you will get the business you need.that is why I won't be back any time soon, there are places that appreciate the business they get, not take it for grantedon to the food, the food was wonderful I got the Pad Thai 3 stars and it was perfect in every way, the serving size was just right nothing left over, even after having Fried Tofu to start off with (3 stars here is like 4 stars at most other places) they don't tame the food down for American pallets they make the food the way it should be, once we got our food the service was great and our water glass never got emptyI can take that it is small and even wait for a seat, but you could turn the music down also it really doesn't need to be that loudif they opened on time they would of gotten a solid 5 stars as it was the best Thai food I have had in &#160;Seattle If you like to eat, you really can't go wrong here. &#160;Sure, there are cons. &#160;The place is small, practically the dictionary definition of "hole in the wall." &#160;The kitchen is right where you can see it, and ventilation is dubious, so it's pretty warm in there most of the time. &#160;Occasionally, Tom will go to Thailand and the restaurant will close down for a week or two. &#160;Also, everyone knows how great it is, so lines are long during any normal meal times. &#160;And if you don't like Thai music, your ears will hurt, because that's pretty much the only thing that ever plays there, usually some variant of Thai rock or Thai techno.The food is, however, indisputably the best Thai food in the entire city. &#160;I mean that sincerely, having tried a score of other inferior places. &#160;It's extremely hard to stay away from the Swimming Rama because their peanut sauce belongs right up there with nectar and ambrosia, but anything you get will be superb: &#160;Phad Thai, chicken with Thai sauce, wide rice noodles, deep fried tofu, wonton rolls, curry... I could go on, but why? &#160;Order anything off the menu. &#160;Throw a dart at it, if you want. &#160;If you like Thai food, you'll enjoy it.And as an added bonus, you'll pay the same price no matter what you get, since every entree' costs exactly the same. &#160;I remember the halcyon days when I was a student at the UW and everything was $6. &#160;Times change and now it's all $7.45, but still worth every penny.If you're really picky about things like "seating" and "atmosphere", just get it to go. &#160;It's served steaming hot so it'll probably be about perfect to eat whenever you bring it back to your place of residence. &#160;But you should eat it. &#160;Really. &#160;Right now. Not sure i really am adding anything by being review #354 but this place rocks! Fantastic portions, sublime taste and quick service. What more could you ask for?Be prepared to get squeezed into a small (probably the smallest restaurant you've been in!) space with no elbow room. Most of the times I've been here, my order was taken on the curb while we were still waiting to be seated!But focus people! You're here for the food! And boy does the food at this place rock! Do not leave Seattle without checking in here. Thai Tom is your typical hole in the wall with some good cheap eats. With seating for only 20 people or so, you definitely have to wait for a table at almost any time of day. After you've secured a spot, don't expect a quick meal because there are only 2 people cooking and several takeout orders!I really enjoy watching these guys cook. Watching them throw a little bit of this and a little bit of that into a flaming wok while you sit kitchen side is just amazing! The only issue I have with this cooking method is inconsistency. We've eaten here about 5 times, and of the 5 times, it was phenominal one time, terrible another, and just ok the other 3 times. We've tried to expand by ordering different things on the menu, but most of the items tend to taste the same. &#160;However, I do suggest the panang curry- 5 stars. It's pretty good! So, last Thursday I found myself cramped in a hot corner of a tiny hole-in-the-wall (yet very well known) restaurant. &#160;I was seated about a foot away from the sweaty chef and rather intimidating fire... I swear my eyebrows were singed at one point during this meal. &#160;The wait was long, and I saw a bug crawling on the wall... But it was all SO worth it. &#160;I LOVE Thai food, and I eat a lot of Thai food, and this was fantastic. &#160;I got the Steamed Vegetables and Tofu with Peanut sauce entree, medium spicy, and it was AMAZING. &#160;The &#160;Peanut Sauce was perfect. &#160;The peanut sauce to end all peanut sauces. &#160;Just the right texture, flavor, and spiciness. &#160;They aren't shy with spicy, so keep that in mind when ordering. &#160;Vegetables and tofu both cooked to perfection. &#160;You CANNOT go to this restaurant and not try at least one thing with their peanut sauce.Not to mention the reasonable prices. &#160;For two people and two very filling meals, the check was $15. &#160;Can't beat that. On my journey to find amazing places, this place has been a staple since I first tasted their firey dishes during my undergraduate years at UW. Even though it was far up the Ave, it was well worth the trip to get the food. Their blistering stir-fry and hot and fast cooking technique turns out some of the most unique and flavorful thai food on the Ave.The food here, has no other equal. The taste is very unique and definitely GOOD. Or else there wouldn't always be people waiting outside for either a table or take-out. Everything from their pad thai, to swimming rama, to panang curry... is delectable enough for you to finish every last drop of food on your plate! I'm salivating already...The only real disadvantage of this place, is the crowd it always draws during meal-times. It's almost impossible to get a table during regular meal times, so a lot of times I usually end up ordering take-out. With the right portions and prices, this place is a smash hit in terms of hole-in-the-wall places. I don't even think I should give the place 5 stars just so that all of you new foodies don't go there! =P j/k this place is awesome and is definitely has a place on my fav thai place list. Careful, Seattle, you might get burned!Thai Tom is delicious, spicy Thai food no holds barred, no frills neither. They're one of the few places that'll make it actually spicy rather than just pretend.The Swimming Rama is the best I've had.Would be 5 stars but for the tiny, cramped tables and the wait. &#160;Get takeout if you want some. I am not going to pay ANY attention to the reviews mentioning rodents - ALL restaurants have them. Even fine dining. Haters keep hatin.Anyway, I don't care. This place is SOOOOO GOOOOD. Best Thai food I have ever had. Quick in and out - they really rush you through so it's not a place to linger. Order level 3 or 4 hotness. Yum!I think the cook's name is George - skinny little dude moving about a mile a minute, cooking everything himself (usually about 6 dishes at once). Guy deserves a Michelin Star. Hands down my favorite thai place and I drive from Edmonds for the good eats! Been haunting this place for years. Love the phad thai because the noodles are skinny and almost burnt... soooo good that way!!! And the red curry is amazing. Haven't had a bad dish yet. Typically I'll leave with my lips on FIRE and they stay that way for hours. Yummm! Mama like!! The vibe is groovy and watching the chef throw food around is half the fun. Sometimes the workers can be a bit standoffish... especially if you show up a few minutes before opening time. But they can't blame hungry Thai Tom lovers!!Cash only! Scary bathroom!Heard a rumor that it's shut down? Must go check that out for myself... In search of cheap eats in the U-District, and a friend suggested Thai Tom. So glad I was introduced to this place! I went there twice in one week it was so good. Beware, their spicy rating is a lot more liberal that other places around town!The SpaceTiny. The kitchen is the dining room. The waiting area is the sidewalk outside. Expect a wait when you get there. Best to go at off-peak times to avoid a 20 minute wait. Sit at the bar and beware of the heat! But as a bonus, you get a front row view of the cooks at work! The FoodInexpensive, delicious, and VERY SPICY! Just thinking about this place makes my mouth water. When asked how spicy you'd like your dish, aim low. It'll still be spicier than you expect. The pad thai was so tasty! It reminded me of street vendor noodles in Bangkok. Very chewy and not too sweet (as some places tend to make it).The ServiceFriendly, speedy. For a place that is always crowded and in such a tiny space, they seem to have their rhythm. ExtrasDon't forget your cash! They don't take cards. OMG this place is legit...mostly because of the chef. Wow. I've never seen one person churn out so many dishes so efficiently ever before in my life. My family and I went for dinner tonight around 8pm and the place was packed! We had to wait about 10 minutes and had our orders taken beforehand. By the time we sat down, we only had to wait a couple minutes before all four dishes came out. In all, we ordered the Garlic Pepper Chicken, Yellow Curry Chicken, Basil Tofu and Pad Thai. All dishes came with a bit of steamed rice on the side.We were seated at the bar next to the chef so we got to see firsthand all the dishes being created. He singlehandedly manned four ranges, woks, ladles and spatulas. It made me feel really slow in comparison. I kind of felt pressured to eat quickly, which in combination with the spiciness of the dishes, made for a bit of indigestion after. The flavor of the dishes was pretty good as were the prices. I can see this being super awesome on a rainy day. The small dining area and proximity to the range ensures that your dining experience will be a warm one. This hole in the wall makes me feel like I'm on the streets of Bangkok. &#160;I only tried the pad thai. &#160;O.M.G. &#160;So good! &#160;I've read about people complaining about the burnt noodles - au contraire - I love that the pad thai has that smoky charred flavor - that's what makes it so good! &#160;I did wait 20 minutes to get a seat. &#160;The place is tiny and is not good for groups or kids. &#160;Service is perfunctory. &#160;It is basically street food but indoors. &#160;You will come out smelling like pad thai and your shirt will still reek 24 hours later. &#160;Is it worth it? &#160;Hell yes! &#160;Oh and bring cash as they don't take credit cards - like I said - it's like an indoor street food stall. &#160;Smell ya later. Thai tom is by far the best. The green curry is so good. Oh and the peanut sauce. Yummy. Price is just right. They have these great little boat bowls that make it even better. It is a tiny place so kind of hard to find a seat. I'm torn here. &#160;I've loved Thai Tom for an awfully long time, and the food has always been very good. &#160;Here's the problem: on our most recent visit, we took my in-laws and on the way out, my very quiet, demure mother-in-law says, "The food was great, but the cockroach was a bit off-putting." &#160;Sure enough, on her plate was a thoroughly cooked, thoroughly sauced, large, dead cockroach. &#160;Ewwww! &#160;My in-laws didn't want to make a fuss, so we continued to exit the restaurant without saying anything to the wait staff.The most disturbing part was how easy it would have been to miss the cockroach until it was already in your mouth - which is a really repulsive thought. &#160;When it's covered in sauce and mixed in with everything else, it's actually pretty hard to notice.Again, the food is great, but will I be able to enjoy it after the cockroach experience? &#160;Probably not. :( The food here is definitely above average. The setting, feels like you've just walked into a summer rush hour Thai bistro with a buffalo parked outside. oh how i miss "the ave" &#160;and UW!i love this place...love the charming hole-in-the-wall style.only downside is that it's cash-only and there is usually a long wait during dinner time.i love their swimming rama, fried rice, and phad thai. delicious! &#160;the service is mediocre but the food definitely makes up for it.i think this is my favorite thai restaurant so far. i have yet to be as impressed and entertained (you can watch the cooks make the food right from your seat).one suggestion - i wish this place would expand a bit so safety and seating isn't always an issue. If you know what to expect, this is the absolute best Thai restaurant you'll ever go to. &#160;I used to live about a block from here, the lines outside are pretty long but expect that before you go. &#160;It is an EXTREMELY small place, but they know how to handle the rush in their business and if they quote you a wait time, they are generally precise. &#160;As long as you understand it's a small place, you'll be able to appreciate it more. &#160;The music is really loud, REALLY loud, it's pretty hard to hear the person sitting next to you. &#160;I honestly don't know how this place passes the health inspection, the pots and pans are thrown from dishwasher to chef, and food is grabbed and mixed with hands. &#160;The stove is literally feet away from some of the seats, and you are right by the action watching a single chef cook every meal, it's really fun to watch and you find you don't mind the loud music because you're so lost in watching the food being made; it's amazing how fast he goes!!! The service isn't good, you feel pretty processed through the restaurant, but that's just the kind of restaurant this is. &#160;The emphasis is clearly on the food, which is fine by me because it is SO SO &#160;GOOD. &#160;The portions are huge, I can eat it for probably three meals. &#160;At less than $8 per meal, that's an awesome deal. &#160;Once you eat here (if you can handle the cramped, loud atmosphere), you will measure all Thai food to that at Thai Tom, and you'll be hardpressed to find anything nearly as good. Have had Thai food that tasted better at tons of other places. Pad Thai was burnt, chicken overcooked, not tasty at all. Try somewhere else. My daughter and I love this restaurant and have only been disappointed once. We got food here of all times during the street fair and they were just cranking food out of here. So, while we were disappointed in the quality at that time we have been satisfied every other time we have eaten here. It's usually busy so if you can get there as they open otherwise kiss your seat goodbye. I've been there for lunch and dinner and especially at dinner time there is a line out the door. It's small and so it is hard to find a seat. If you come with more than 3 people you won't be sitting together. Which is okay if you don't like some of the people you are with. At any rate, you can also call in your order and take it home and go "Oh my God this is so good" in front of your roommates who will be sitting there drooling at the smell of your yummy food. They do have seating at the counter and you can watch them cook your food. You aren't going to be sitting there long because they like to get the food cooked and to you and you out the door so the next person can sit down. It's kind of like being stuck in a revolving door only you get food. I would have gone 5 star but hey one disappointment and I have to take a star away. Love Thai Toms although I can never get the name right. I'm forever asking my daughter if she wants to go to Tom Thai's but she always knows where I mean. &#160;Oh and one last big note - Bring Cash! They only take cash. Great food. &#160;I have the PadThai, and it has a roasting sensation. &#160;The food is good. &#160;When the chef cooks, it could be entertaining. &#160;My only complain, the waiter could be slightly rude. &#160;Here is a 4 out of five This place rocks. &#160;It is very up tempo, do not come here to relax or hang out, just come to get in, get some great Thai, and get out. &#160;I got the impression from some reviews that it might be dirty and nasty, but it's really clean and efficient, just very small. &#160;You will feel cramped and get jostled a lot, so if that bugs you, don't go. &#160;You will also probably have to wait a few minutes out front, so be prepared. &#160; The only secret I have found is to go alone and get a seat at the bar, which lets you skip the line sometimes. &#160;The other nice thing about the bar is watching the chef in action- he has a lot of energy.Right now I am addicted to the Panang Curry with chicken, which is nicely minced and heavily sauced, but not overly creamy, which is good.These guys clearly know how to make simple Thai food that caters to tradition and tastes great. &#160;A lesson a lot of Thai joints in Seattle could really take to heart.My only complaint is how short the menu is, as a lot of my Thai favorites just aren't on offer. &#160;It's disappointing because they are so good at what they do have that I wonder how good the others would be.
Guys? this is really sad. Thai Tom! the "Best Thai in Seattle" has officially GONE DOWNHILL. &#160;I'd heard it from friends. I heard it on Yelp. But i just had to go see for myself. &#160;The food was overly oiled and spiced, but not as usual. This time, *sigh* it was kinda nasty. As for texture, the noodles were dense and clingy, and the tofu was burned. &#160;I am sorry, &#160;truly, but goodbye forever Thai Tom. Not bad food. &#160;A little lackluster, but decent. &#160;Not the worse food in the U-district, but you could do better. easily the best thai you'll ever have in seattle. if there's better, someone please let me know. take a $20 and a few ones for the tip and enjoy.
This area is great to get stuff done - like eating food!I had my car at the Firestone shop up the street and usually walk this area while waiting. I decided to try Q's banh mi. Selection of choice? Grilled pork... this was really good and I liked how the bread cut was on the top and not on the side. The side cuts tend to spew out the insides with each bite. Nice older lady helping me despite the obvious language barrier. I also managed to get a fresh avocado bubble tea.Good stuff and crazy value. You want a contact high? Head to Q Bakery any day and take in the fresh baked baguettes intoxicating aroma. Even though it's mostly a bakery for people to pick up sandwiches and other Vietnamese goodies, I wanted to find a corner and just immerse myself in the fresh baked goodness. And of course, with that fresh baked aroma comes the best tasting, freshest baguettes for the banh mi. The veggie and the shredded chicken banh mi are so tasty, fresh and cheap! The only thing that I like about this place is that they accept cc/debts. Also, there not as crowed like Tammys. Their banh mi isn't all that great. SO DON'T BUY IT! I'll stick to Tammy's Bakery's I get the grilled pork banh mi, it is a wonderful, and cheap sandwich. &#160;The place does look clean, and they have a hot case full of interesting looking stuff which I have yet to try, but I bet it's very good. &#160;I love how fast I get in and out of there, too.
I've been to practically every Vietnamese deli in the Seattle area, and this is the cleanest one of them all. Here are a few pointers. 1. Try out the Vietnamese subs. The difference between this place and other places is the type of bread they use. The dough is less dense and they are made FRESH right there. I've talked to the owner. There's 20+ people in the back making bread. &#160;The BBQ pork and tofu are great...avoid the chicken. It's too dry to swallow. &#160;2. Next to the cash register is a display of hum bao. Steamed buns with either pork or chicken. If the lady doesn't understand which one you want, here's a chance for you to practice your Viet. Chicken is "gaah" and pork is "hell". They both have a quail egg inside. Yum!3. Avoid the sweet buns. They're delivered from CA. Nothing special. Get fresh ones from "Delite Bakery" in Beacon Hill instead4. Hot food section (far left of the store) is a bit iffy. I tried the beef stew ($3/small portion) and it was way too fatty. Get it if you're malnourished or desperate. The people at Q Bakery are so nice, I wish I knew what everything was so I could buy more than my 'usual': a ham and cheese croissant or two, a cookie for my daughter and occasionally a baguette.They offer hot deli type food, hum bow, and more. &#160;Unfortunately, I'm a Viet-newbie and don't know what half of it is in the packages. &#160;It sure looks yummy though.What I do get is fantastic; the croissants are perfectly baked, flakey on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. Cookies are just okay but a 4 year old has different standards and the cookie to M&amp;M and chocolate chip ratio works perfectly for her to dig them out and make a huge mess in my car. This place rocks! &#160;Why does this place rock you might ask?1) The cleanest Vietnemese sandwich place/deli I have ever seen.2) They bake their own bread and pastries!! major score!3) The Banh MI is killer delicious!Was taken by some of my Columbia City peeps the other day. &#160;Located in a fairly vietnemese heavy strip mall down on Rainer, this place immediatley caught my eye! &#160;Nice clean floors, an actual bakery where you can actually see your bread and pastries baked, clearly this place was above your regular sandwich place. &#160;Their hot bar looked pretty good although I was too full to check any of it out. &#160;I was intrigued by their version of shrimp toast which has a whole shrimp (head and all) somehow fried onto a slice of baguette or crostini! &#160;Very tasty looking. &#160;Bahn Mi I went with the the Bahn Mi Xiu Mai. &#160;Essentially a sandwich stuffed with the inside of dumpling (the porky chinese kind). &#160;So good! &#160;anyhow, strong recommendation for those in the area. Pretty good Vietnamese bakery. Headed over to Q after a little shopping at Viet Wah. It is in the same strip mall complex in another building to the side. This is more than a bakery, there is also Vietnamese deli items and banh mi offered here.The bakery selections are a mix of Asian and Western goods. You will find baguettes and croissants alongside Chinese donuts, BBQ pork buns and egg tarts here. They also have random convenience store type snacks and a fridge case full of drinks and desserts.Picked up a raspberry croissant ($1.50), coconut bread rolls ($2) and a pate chaud ($1.75). The croissant and coconut bread was decent and a good value for sure. Not on par with a Le Panier type bakery, but solid. Though the pate chaud, which is a flaky meat puff pastry was a standout. The fact that they are kept in a heated case keeps them nice and hot, which is how they should be eaten.Q Bakery is a solid bakery with a diverse selection of baked goods and Vietnamese deli delights. This place is my reward lunch spot from work. Can't beat a $2.50 lunch. &#160;I stick with the grilled pork. The bread is baked on site, and the meat is delicious. They have some lunch box type things that are quite tasty as well. &#160;I have only tried a spattering of their baked goods (coconut buns = yum). &#160;If you're in the area and are craving a solid vietnamese sandwich, check this place out!Extra plus= they take credit card. Wow!! Who knew? Happened to notice this little place as I drove by. The building faces MLK and is kind of over shadowed by the other places in this shopping center. I walk in and OMG, the smell of fresh rolls and baguettes, heaped in baskets. Pastries and donuts of ALL kinds, made on site. &#160;Almond sponge cakes. Surreal. Light, fluffy, melt in your mouth goodness. The bahn mi sandwiches are awesome....crusty roll, moist meat, a pile of fresh herbs and veggies. So good. And did I mention the unbelievably low prices? Cheap, freshly made food and baked goods. &#160;Check it out!!
The baguettes and rolls are excellent, and although I haven't tried them yet I'm excited about the dozen-plus types of filled croissants on offer at ridiculously low prices. &#160;Cheese, with or without ham? &#160;Blueberry, with or without cream cheese? &#160;Chocolate, almond? &#160;This could be dangerous. &#160;I have a bad bakery habit, but at least at Q Bakery I won't go broke while I get fat. &#160;I've tried four different banh mi, and I'll agree with Matthew that the basic ones are somewhat Americanized. &#160;Mushroom was more interesting than chicken or BBQ pork, obviously. &#160;That made this a good place to get food for the in-laws that seemed exotic, but not too scary. &#160;(Note to self: don't publish this on Facebook, where the in-laws might see it.) &#160; Q Bakery's location on two divided streets makes it a slight pain to get to, but it's worth a stop if you want affordable variety. This used to be the location of my favorite Bahn Mi shop in Seattle, King Baguettes, so when I saw that, after one year as a Pho restaurant, that a new Bahn Mi joint had taken up residence. &#160;With dreams of King Baguettes' Chicken Bahn Mi dancing in my head I quickly rushed in.At first examination, Q Bakery is a lot more welcoming than the old King Baguette. &#160;There are a variety of baked goods in the cases, and they have both Bahn Mi and regular deli sandwiches available. &#160;I had both a pork and a teriyaki chicken bahn mi, and I found that they didn't quite hit the mark.  On the plus side, Q Bakery is not stingy with the meat, and the meat is both flavorful and juicy. &#160;The teriyaki chicken was especially interesting as I've never had a bahn mi like it before, and I quite enjoyed it. &#160;Also, Q Bakery is mercifully light on the mayonnaise. &#160;On the down side, both my sandwiches lacked much kick. &#160;They tasted like an Americanized bahn mi, with all the asian flavors toned way down. &#160;The baguette itself was also kind of disapointing, being more chewy than crusty.For a brand new place, however, I think Q Bakery has a lot of potential, and I look forward to trying them out again in the near future. YUM! I always, always look forward to visiting my family in Seattle, WA so I can get all types of baked goodies from Q's. They are known for their banh mi's. I usually order the banh mi cha lua.. The customer service, is getting better. English is obviously not their second language, but many establishments these days aren't anyways! Love this place. &#160;We mostly go there for the Vietnamese sandwiches. &#160;I usually go for the veggie ones - they're full of flavorful tofu and a great assortment of veggies. &#160;I don't feel like I've just had a sandwichful of bread after eating there - it actually feels like I've eaten my veggies. &#160;My husband gets the meat sandwiches. &#160;He says he likes Q's sandwiches because chicken is not shredded, the sandwich is "bigger" and the store is great because it's better lit, better arranged, and tidier than some.Having lived in France (and eaten my way though many-a-patisserie) I have to add that Q's pastry selection and taste are pretty awesome. I'm talking straight up delicious pains au chocolat and pains aux raisins. &#160;They also have all sorts of candies in jars, and sesame treats. &#160;They have one or 2 tables w/ 4 or 6 chairs for eating in. &#160;They're open til 7pm. &#160;Also, they take cards, which makes it handy if we don't have cash.One star off because it's been a little tough to communicate with the folks there since we don't speak Vietnamese. &#160;Wouldn't be a problem except we've ended up with the wrong food before. Overall, great little place. &#160;And I'll totally be bringing my parents there when they come to visit this weekend - thanks for the idea, Matthew!PS - Brought my mom there when she came for a visit and she loved it. &#160;Naturally, the 'rents had never had a Vietnamese sandwich before; great way to introduce them to the magic of banh mi.
I was craving sushi like no other after a show one night and I had my heart set on Wasabi Bistro. Imagine my disappointment when the wait for a table for three was an hour and a half. I didn't want to wait because I was starving so my friend suggested Kushibar. I had known of its existence but never took the time to venture in. Kushibar is simply decorated with lots of wood furnishings and an outdoor seating area which we choose to sit in. I did like the fact we could be "outside" in the middle of winter. The menus were quirky as they were like comic books. Imagine my surprise when I did not see spider rolls, which I was craving like a mofo, on the menu. Argh! I was hoping to see two pages filled with sushi options but my assumption was way off. Since sushi was entirely out of the picture my options were noodles, ramen, fried things, and much more. The menu wasn't puny at all. I decided to go with the pork. kimchee, and salmon noodles. One friend went with a variety of skewers and another got the gyoza. My kimchee noodles came piping hot in a big black hot. When I mean piping hot I mean like first degree burn hot. I had to wait at least twenty minutes for it to cool down and even then it was still a hazard. My friend had to point out there were two small bowls and spoons to shovel the soup in to. Oh, that will probably help it to get to an eatable temperature. When it did I was quite satisfied. The noodles tasted homemade, the salmon was a great representation of salmon, the kimchee was nice and spicy, and the broth was as well. Even though all I wanted was sushi and Kushibar didn't have what I wanted on the menu, the noodles were a good alternative. I left with full soup belly and was satisfied. Whenever I'm craving ramen - I think of kushibar. &#160;While I've definitely have had better japanese and ramen - I just find this place very consistent and the food is always solid. &#160;Plus, who doesn't love the curry popcorn they give. &#160;I've had mixed service here - sometimes it can be really nice and other times it can be quite slow but not a big deal cause it's a pretty cool place to hang out at. I admit my bar for japanese food is high and this one just sucks. &#160;Do Not Recommend at all.I ordered Shoyu Raemen and takoyaki. &#160;Both of them tasted ok just better than being awful. &#160;The frozen ones from Uwajimaya are honestly better.Save yourself $$ and hassle to find parking in Belltown. Any time Pixies are being played with a bowl full of goodness- I'm a happy camper.Had a great time for a wedding party at this joint- cool locale. &#160;I have to admit, I have had better- but I enjoyed myself immensely. &#160;3 stars for food- one for the tunes/ great service. The menu looked so cheap that we'd ordered a little bit of everything because it was per skewer/serving. It was ok. Our bill came to over $100 for 3 ppl. This street food wasn't so cheap after all. Their yakisoba was something that stood out the most. Will not be back, but glad that we did tried. My friends and I stumbled across this place while strolling downtown Seattle during our last night of our weekend getaway..When you first walk in its a bar.. and the back of the place is the dining portion.. we never got to eat anything, just drinks... so i cant comment on that.. i can point out that they lay out popcorn sprinkled with curry powder at the bar and on the tables.. its amazing.. we kept asking for refills because the curry powder popcorn was so good.. the drinks are well made.. strong.. may be a bit on the pricy side.. but worth it if you consider the volume and alcohol content they include in their mixes.. it is a bit crowded because the layout is a narrow rectangle shape.. but once you get up to the bar you will be served well and greeted with the delicious popcorn.. If i'm back in seattle again I'd like to stop by here and try their food as well.. it seemed to be your general japanese foods.. ramen.. things of that nature. All I know is:THE CURRY POPCORN IS THE BOMBThe Octopus ball thingys (tako yaki) , were dam good, and the kimchi fried rice is delicious, so are the Cucumber Daquiris. You can go wrong with the skewers (kushi yaki) I haven't had one I didn't like. Great place for parties on the weekends, Fever is usually spinning and always plays CUTS. Honestly, my wife and I love this place. It's one of the only restaurants in Seattle that we routinely come back to.Cool atmosphere, and really great food. The curry-something popcorn that they bring out when you sit down is pretty delicious, and we almost always order the same things off the menu. Fried tofu for the appetizer, and the spicy nabeyaki udon soup and the pork street-style fried rice for dinner. The service is decent, but that's not why we come here. It's just dependably good food. BAR REVIEW: 3.5 starsWould have been a 4- but the bathroom was ridiculous. There's no way a big place like this only has one tiny bathroom. I really enjoyed myself at this spot. Great indoor and outdoor seating. The patio area is cool if you want to escape the noisy sweaty bar line. I don't know if i went on "asian" night, but there were a lot of asian-americans there that night. All in their 20's. Young crowd, decent atmosphere. Awesome priced drinks, but I'm from LA so what the hell do I know about Seattle prices. Had an amazing time there, great place to drink for big groups (with small bladders)! I have been to this place twice. Absolutely LOVE the takoyaki. I come here for the Ramen. Since Buddha left Belltown there isn't a pho place around and this is even better! Friendly helpful staff and the food is always great! Friggin' love this place, although my friends sometimes complain about the lack of parking. But it has this pretty cool extension part of the main restaurant where the bar is and it's kinda like eating on the street except less street-y. The extension does get colder in the winter and freakin' hot in the summer, but hey, that's what you get on the real streets! I heart me some kim chee fried rice (hold the pork) that is my staple when I go there. Deee-licious! And the skewers are pretty good, too, albeit a little expensive compared to other skewered-meat places like Satay. But the best skewers, to me, are the cheaper and more unusual ones. The chicken skin skewer is crunchy and yummy and my favorite. I also like the gizzard. I do sometimes splurge on the salmon with mayo one which just melts in your mouth. Love the okonomiyaki but I think I may prefer Wann's takoyaki and okonomiyaki to the ones at Kushibar. Definitely one of my faves :) Staff is very friendly. It's a great place for a late night happy hour. The environment is very upbeat with good pop music. The udon was huge, however, the chicken meat was a bit dry. The atmosphere in here is cool, unfortunately so is the temperature - I was freezing! Ordered the shrimp yaki soba which I thought would be a soup but was instead big fat yummy noodles in sauce. &#160;Delish! &#160;The ramen came in a HUGE bowl and the consensus was that it was also quite tasty. &#160;I do like the concept of all the little grilled skewers. &#160;The Honey I'm Home cocktail was also a delightful surprise. &#160;I'd not thought of combining ginger and tequila before, and it really worked well. &#160;The prices seemed a little high but I think that's just Belltown. I've been here for HH a few times...and I don't feel like anything I ate was very memorable. This is supposed to be street food themed? I don't think I picked up on that. I think this may be a good late night place to hang out when you're drunk and don't care what you eat, but if you're hungry, go next door...in either direction. Went here with a friend I hadn't seen in a few years. We ordered some yakitori combos and some beer/sake. The food was really good and the service was great. The curry popcorn was something new but really tasty. I had a great time and would go again when I visit. We love the Ramen at Kushibar! Fun casual atmosphere with neat stylized artwork, cool menu, good drinks, and delicious food. I even took my picky parents there, and they loved their meals. Going again tonight! Popcorn sprinkled with curry powder...amazing combo!! &#160;I had 2 bowls to myself! &#160;I ordered Tonkatsu Don...it was good..I had better. &#160;I should have ordered the Yakisoba or even the Tako Yaki instead...Over all..it was a good experince...It a cool place to hang out.
"What the hell's going on in this place?!" That was the first thing I thought after I walked in, sat down, and looked at the menu (which consisted of anything from noodles edamame to skewers) and after the waiter promptly delivered a nice, wooden bowl of popcorn to whet our appetites. I looked at the menu (Japanese street food!) and then I looked at the popcorn (which turned out to be delicious and curry-flavored or something) and then I went to the bathroom which was plastered with comic-book wallpaper. Each of these things would be awesome on their own but all together in one place, it's like multiple personality disorder in a restaurant. We were there for happy hour and the sake was pretty good (a little too fruity for my tastes...not that I'm a sake master AT ALL) and the food would have been good, had it actually been street food (ie: street food prices!). I'll pay up for delicious cuts of raw fish but not for cuts that are just haphazardly grilled. For a sampler platter, two glasses of sake, and an order of the Dragon Balls (which we ordered just because they were called Dragon Balls! Scallops wrapped with bacon...), the total came to about $40 with tip. Once again, I venture away from Maneki's only to find that I shouldn't have been so foolish!P.S. They had martini specials on Thursdays...but only for women! Maybe this is standard but I feel like that's kinda dumb. I get why clubs and such would have incentives for women like no cover charge or whatever but, come on! Everyone should enjoy HH. I came here around 12:30 am on a weekday night so it was pretty dead. But given the size and the layout it seems like it would be a pretty happening place on the weekend. We were trying to sober up after visiting Bathtub Gin &amp; Co. so we just wanted to get a couple of bites. We started off with the takoyaki which I enjoyed quite a bit. But I could probably only have two to three of them at a time before I would get sick of the taste. We also tried several skewers. The skewers are what you see is what you get, which means you get one skewer with four pieces on them (at least for the ones we tried). The ones we had: tuna, yellow tail, and fishcake were alright but nothing special. But they were definitely overpriced. Next time I'd probably try the udon or some other plate that is more substantial. Supposedly some of the other items are very good and filling. But this is definitely on my list of places to check out again, especially on a weekend when it is filled to capacity. Kushibar is a decent, that's really all I can say about it. I was initially attracted to the place because of it's cool outside but inside patio area that runs along the sidewalk. It's a great place to eat a meal and people watch on busy nice nights. &#160;Gotta love the Belltown crowd. &#160;Overall it is a great space for a restaurant. I like a restrained decor with exposed concrete. &#160;But on to the food...All I've eaten here have been the different ramen soup bowls and a few of the unreasonably pricy skewered meats and veggies. &#160;None of them are spectacular and really pale in comparison to the great ramen I'm familiar with from down in Orange County and LA. &#160;The broth is flavorful and the meat and veggies in it are really good, but honestly the main focus of the dish: THE NOODLES, are lackluster. &#160;Shin Sen Gumi in OC and LA is superior in every way. $12 for a bowl of soup is pretty hard to swallow too. &#160;I have to admit with much reluctance that this is the best ramen I've had in Seattle though. That's a major diss I know, but frankly I haven't had ramen anywhere else. How is it that a city filled with some of the most excellent sushi and teriyaki in the country can be so lean in true proper ramen spots. &#160;It makes me wish I was some ballin' restaurateur so that I could poach one of those ramen chefs from Cali and bring him up here and open up something truly worthy. &#160;Sigh. &#160;If any of my fellow Yelpers know where I can get a 2legit2quit bowl of ramen, please holler. The grilled meats and veggies on skewers are all good for what they are, but again, the price of them always makes me regret ordering them after I've gobbled them up. &#160;I DO appreciate the fact that they have chicken hearts. I grew up eating those, and they grill them very well here and I savor the texture and taste of the tiny organ.Besides the grub, the staff here are friendly, courteous and professional, and they are also an attractive lot..if that matters to you. Went for happy hour during the freezing weather, and there were very few people there since it was so darn cold out. &#160;All of the members of the staff were on their cell phones... interesting.The curry popcorn is pretty tasty, and since this was more of an Izakaya than a Sushi joint, we ordered a spicy nabeudon. &#160;It had little chunks of chicken, which was kind of incongruous with the dish- typically, meat in dishes other than yakitori is shaved. &#160;So little chicken bits floated down to the bottom of my kimchi nabeudon. &#160;We also ordered yakitori- which unfortunately was fairly unseasoned. &#160;Yakitori generally should be fairly tasty on its own. &#160;The food really did leave something to be desired.The service was a little off. &#160;While we were seated very quickly, the waitress was continually asking us as we were eating if we wanted anything else. &#160;I felt like she was pushing us to order more, which isn't what you want to experience when dining out. &#160;Plus, the cooks as well as the staff kept checking their phones for texts and whatnot.Could have been better. I came here at around 1230-1am with a couple of friends. We needed FOOD and Kushibar provided!We had a friendly server who brought us a giant pot of green tea. We had 2 orders of &#160;takoyaki, which were good appetizer sized portions. These were ok but I normally do not eat octopus. &#160;We also shared 3 skewers: tuna, yellowtail, and fishcake. The skewers were all delicious but small; at $2-4 per skewer these were more like $1 portions for street food. Of course we were not on the street. Hence the markup?They had some good-sounding udon and ramen bowls on the menu so if I end up hungry in this neighborhood again at night, I'll try one of those!The interior feels pretty "Belltown." contemporary, clean, otherwise nondescript except for the strange patio-like seating area that appears enclosed with roughly split and hastily nailed 2x4s. That looks like a fun place to sit and it is definitely not slick! Nice. Wow, lots of food for the money plus they serve soju.We ordered the yellowtail collar, spicy nabeyaki udon, katsu don, and 2 bottles of soju. Total was a little over $50. We arrived just as they opened so it was completely empty.We thought the yellowtail collar was going to be a little appetizer but it turned out to be a pretty big slab of fish, although the server indicated it was larger than normal. We could have split that fish and been good for the night. The fish itself was tasty and simply prepared by grilling. The accompanying salad was a bit too salty so I tried to pair it with some fish meat. It also came with a ponzu dipping sauce that was a little difficult to navigate with flaked off fish bits, but it was quite tasty overall.The spicy nabeyaki udon was very tasty. It was much too spicy but it was taaaasty. It came out looking wonderful in a bubbling clay pot. We didn't get to it for about 10 minutes since we were busy with the yellowtail but when we did, it was still piping hot and the noodles still had that wonderfully springy texture of good udon. It was so good, we even packed up the leftover broth to eat at home with rice.The katsudon came in a huge bowl. I only had a few spoonfuls before deciding it would be my lunch the next day. It was pretty tasty but the sauce was a too much on the sweet side. They may have used teriyaki sauce since it looked like it was covered in a dark bbq sauce and was quite sweet. If they had used a mirin, soy sauce mixture, I would have seen more of the egg, which was lost.We really enjoyed the soju they served. It had a wee bit of the expected nail-polish remover aftertaste but it was otherwise refreshing with a subtle flavor.We will definitely go with friends the next time around since two dishes nearly knocked us out into a food coma. Kushibar has become my favourite Belltown restaurant. You get a good portion of food for the price, and everything I've tried has been delicious! The pork fried rice is one of my favourites! The have a cool outdoor patio area, and I rarely see them over packed. WAY better than Wasabi Bistro! This little place is great for happy hour. The service is quick and the food comes out fast. All of the comfort from home cooked food. My favorite part was the curried popcorn. It was a nice little snack to have before the food came. I liked the many options for robata. I would definitely recommend this place. This place has a lot of promise. &#160;There's an excellent large outdoor seating area, and the menu is unique: they offer skewers in much the same way you'd normally see sushi. &#160;Food was just OK, but deserves another shot. &#160;Service was very friendly. I went to Kushibar to seek out chahan. &#160;Alas, their recipe just can't compare to Toshi's in Eugene, but other items were quite tasty.I really liked the skewer sets, the salmon &amp; scallop were both quite tasty. &#160;These were mildly seasoned, with lemon available for your squirting pleasure. &#160;Of all the dishes I tried, the skewers were my favorite, gotta love that protein!If you're a noodle lover, you'll be happy here. &#160;The udon bowls were awesome, chock full of amazing surprises (fried egg, veggies, fish balls? more and more as you got deeper and deeper). &#160;Only had a few tastes of the tempura, but seemed pretty good to me.A word of caution - it's easy to get carried away and order way too much stuff (especially if you think you're sharing with others). &#160;Items are cheap, but they do add up. &#160;Start slow.The staff was great at dealing with our confusing group - thanks for the wonderful service! Drink refills &amp; dishes came out at a fast pace all night.Overall, I think it was a great place to hold my first "UYE". &#160;Yay! =)Accessibility note: bathrooms were fine (a bit dim), patio tables were good, but if someone couldn't transfer onto the bench it would minimize available seating at that table, looked like some good tables inside as well. I went here for a coworker's bday and my first thought was that the place looks pretty cool. It all went downhill right when we entered. Her BF made a reservation for about 10 people and they forgot about it. However, they quickly set up our table especially since there weren't a lot of people in the place yet.I was not a fan of the popcorn, but kept eating it since I was starving. &#160;I ordered a side of kimchi, a side of rice and 2 steak skewers. The steak was juicy but bland. It was a good thing I ordered kimchi since that helped add some flavor to the meat.Splitting the bill was a total nightmare. The waitress gave us one bill and told us to do it ourselves since it was a lot more work on her part. It sucked because some of the people in our party left so someone had to pay more out of pocket.In general, great concept but it needs a lot more work. I like Kushibar bunches. I only go during happy hour. It makes me happy because it is well-priced and I can order weird stuff like chicken skin and gizzards. Yippee! whoever invented ramen deserves a nobel peace prize!!! as a family, we seldom took a road trip that lasted more than 48 hours because to my parents, packing 3 kids in a sedan and driving for 2-3 hours weren't something they considered to be remotely fun. we always ended up coming home in complete silence, mom mad at dad for his maniac driving maneuvers, me screaming at my sister for not sharing her last lolly pop, my sister begging to make another potty stop...you name it, we were mad at anything and everything by the end of that 48 hours. to make the matter worse, we refused to have another bite of hamburgers or pizza. weary and tired, my mom always brought peace to our table by making some ramen which we devoured with sour kimchi. as we gulped down the last drop of that ramen soup, we became a functional family unit again...at last! after being out all day in freezing cold rainy seattle weather, the husband and i had reached that complete silent moment, weary and tired. kushibar wasn't on our radar, but it was just a few blocks from our hotel, and we desperately needed some hot bowls of soups and noodles. the restaurant occupied a sizable space with high ceilings and exposed walls. the menu consisted of predictable japanese izakaya bites and noodle dishes. we settled for two bowls of noodles and gyoza. my kimchi seafood udon arrived in a stone pot which kept the soup piping hot throughout the meal. this dish tasted a lot like sweat, spicy, watered down kimchi jjigae in not so pleasant way. the noodles were way over cooked and felt very genetic. perhaps this could've been a much better dish had it been cooked with chewy, thin ramen noodles. the hubby's miso ramen was a complete failure. it was huge in size, but not in flavor. the soup lacked the depth and complexity i enjoyed from santouka's miso ramen. the noodles didn't fare much better, again being too soft and bland. my thought of sharing our dishes went out the door immediately after the first bite. the only redeeming thing of the night was the dipping sauce that accompanied our order of 7 tiny gyozas. again, nothing special about these (actually, they need to be pan fried more for crispy skin), but the sauce was really well made with the perfect amount of soy sauce, vinegar and oil. sadly, kushibar didn't do justice to the inventor of ramen. &#160;i've witnessed many different ways of dishonoring ramen, but this was by far the worst. I went to Kushibar today with my dad for lunch and let me tell you, going there on such a hot day was kind of a bad idea. You can sit outside, but their little sitting area is basically a sauna when it's hot out, or you can sit inside, but there's no air conditioning and the kitchen is right behind the sitting area, so it's hot and stuffy inside too. My dad and I decided to sit inside because it was about five degrees cooler, and after we sat, we were each handed a small bowl of salad. The salad was lettuce, tomato and cucumber with a sesame oil dressing which was really good. They had a lunch special menu where everything was $8, so I ordered the spicy nabeyaki and he ordered the yakisoba. The food took forever to arrive, but when it did, I regretted ordering the nabeyaki. Not only was it really hot soup in an iron bowl that was never going to allow it to cool down, but it was also ridiculously spicy! Luckily, my dad loves spicy and he loves me, so he traded and I ate the yakisoba instead. The yakisoba was pretty good, they went a little heavy with the sauce, but the cabbage was stir fried perfectly and they topped it off with ginger. The yakisoba also came with miso soup.TL;DR: Tasty food, large portions, $8 lunch, spicy means spicy, slow service. Went here on a Wednesday Night (eg 08-18-10), for the late happy hour. &#160;They have very good options for the happy hour menu. &#160;The popcorn bowl they had was pretty unique (it was there to make you drink more), because it had a mixture of salt and curry powder. &#160;Bartender chick was kind of slow, but she was very cool. &#160;I will have to go back to try their restaurant entrees. I like sitting in the extendo-trailer thing that they have. Feels kinda "street". The grilled fish with the roe inside the belly is the best thing on the menu if you like that kind of stuff. The fried rice ain't bad either, especially the kimchee one... but do remember it will haunt your breath for hours afterwards. I'd go back again for the grilled items. YUM. :) I love this place for one reason: its okonomiyaki. I love okonomiyaki more than anything in the world, and have spent a great deal of time searching for okonomiyaki in the US after having it in Japan. I'm extremely picky about it because I love it so much. I actively seek it out in whatever city I'm in, but I've never had an okonomiyaki which is reminiscent of Japan's greatness. &#160;So when I stepped into Kushibar, I was hopeful but not expectant. But, to my surprised delight, Kushibar makes absolutely fantastic okonomiyaki. Truly the best I've had in the United States. Their Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki is perfect, and their Osaka-style regular okonomiyaki is delicious. I will definitely be returning to this establishment because it has found a way to bring my favorite part of Japan to the United States. Next time you're in the mood for Japanese food, stray away from the usual sushi rolls and yakisobas and get Kushibar's okonomiyaki. Believe me, it's worth it. Moderately priced, I enjoyed the Oyako Don, but nothing really jumped at me as spectacular. &#160;It just didn't do anything for me on the ambiance or culinary levels. &#160; Maybe my expectations were too high, but I just couldn't get into any element of the experience. I genuinely have very little offer because the experience was so completely bland. There are 2 happy hours here. One that is the usual 4-7pm and then the late night one, I think it's from 9-close (which is 1am) but I'm not 100% sure on the times.This is a hip place to eat Japanese finger foods (Fried Chicken Skin on a stick and other meats on a stick).We had this Japanese pancake that was filled with noodles (they call it Kamakase style). That had to be the best thing I ate.I also liked the Portabelo Mushrooms but they were slightly on the salty side.The thing that attracted us to this place was their "outdoor" dining area. It was a Japanese-style, enclose patio.Oh, the Sesame Seed Ice Cream was delightful and a HUGE portion. It's a nice change from your usual Green Tea but I think I still like Green Tea better.The Lychee Lemonade alcoholic beverage was served in a Martini glass, I was hoping it was going to be served hella cold, with ice in a regular glass like a Long Island but nah. The taste was still good but a little on the sweet side. I enjoy the bridge-like outdoor seating that is enclosed in winter and opens up for fresh air in summer. &#160;I also dig the House Set of skewers for $12 (asparagus, steak, white meat, teriyaki dark meat, salmon, &amp; scallop). &#160;The lightly grilled calamari steak is heaven, and the original Tako Yaki (octopus) is delicious. &#160;And they have $8 Don Buris and $8 noodle bowls at lunch. I had good service both times I ate at Kushibar. &#160;The food was also yummy both times. &#160;I went with friends that were here from out of town and they enjoyed themselves too. &#160;We ordered a bunch of the skewered meats. &#160;The eel is to die for it just melts in your mouth and both times we ended up ordering more eel. how delish are their fried oysters and Chicken Kariage (i am probably bashing the spelling) but i love their fried foods and of course their herbal popcorn! lol. We joke that they add curry powder on it but it might not be a far fetch! drinks are so so. I like thei huge slice of lime in the wells drinks though. During Bar time, its crowded but not too crowded. I would say, they need more servers on the floor, usually they have one inside and one outside. which makes the service sort of slow but they are SUPER nice! i like this place :)OH AND... I ONLY GO WHEN ITS HAPPY HOUR... NO POINT OF DOING REG. DINNER WHEN RESTAURANTS OFFER HH!! TAKO YAKI ALL THE WAY!So I tried a couple of other food options and some beer. All that stuff was fine, location is great, staff was nice, etc.The only thing worth remembering for me, however, was the tako yaki with those little dancing fish flake things on top. Those little balls were very tasty, and I still think about them on occasion - months later!They did seem to enjoy their mayo here, but as long as I can have my order (or two) of tako yaki balls, I'm a very happy girl.I should go pay Kushibar another visit! Great place for happy hour food right before the Belltown Art Walk.You can get enough food for 15 bucks to hold you until your real meal.Go only when Joe is working. &#160;:) This is one of my favorite places in Belltown. &#160;They have a great selection of sake and the grilled skewers are worth many return trips. &#160;Few things really compete with yakitori, butabara and cold beer: &#160;Kushibar has all of these in abundance. &#160;Go now! Went here for quiet, light supper on a Wednesday evening. I had to admit, I was hyped up for this place, even more so than I was for Lady Gaga's concert. The place is set up very neatly, and I loved the indoor patio. It was a great, unique design that allowed you to enjoy the Belltown hustle from an encapsulated point of view. The menu looked great too, revealing a wide selection of Japanese variety with American influences in a hard-to-read Serif font. Unfortunately, that was the extent of Kushibar's merit. Every diner guest receives complimentary popcorn with light miso seasoning. That was alright, but every food order after had some kind of issue. Our ramen's broth was too thick, and the cheese in the cheese-yaki didn't taste as magical as one would have expected. I had fish balls yaki, but it was hardly fresh. Even a food connoisseur could tell that it was frozen for several days at least.The worst part? They were FLIES. Everywhere. I counted at least 15. This probably isn't a problem if you don't sit in the indoor patio area, but it reeked of unsanitation. &#160;This problem could have been easily prevented had Kushibar put up screens in the indoor patio area. I might come back here when it's cold and there are no flies, but only at the insistence of a friend, or perhaps Lady Gaga. I hate the wait staff here with a passion (very slow and inattentive), which is unfortunate for such a hip, trendy space. &#160;And it's such a cool idea to serve Japanese street food as main fare at a restaurant. &#160; It's probably the most unique restaurant we have here in Seattle. &#160;Kind of like how I love Dosa in Mission, San Francisco, which serves large southern Indian vegetarian dosas (but they have great service) -- just a unique experience. &#160;Too bad the service doesn't match. &#160;I'd certainly pay more (and come back again) if it were. I LOVE Kushibar. I haven't had a bad experience here, and keep coming back. The food is so good. I almost always get the spicy nabeyaki tofu, or any of their udon bowls or soups. Seafood is good here, too. I never order the skewers because I don't think the meat is that good and they come in small portions and I'm a big eater.There's this really cute server who always remembers us which is nice, even though I don't consider myself a "regular," but we've been about 15 times since they opened. The ONLY thing I would say to steer away from is going late on a Friday or Saturday night, because there are lots of trashy drunk and obnoxious people from the greater Seattle area...which would be fine in a club, but this is a restaurant, people! I guess that is Belltown for you! The curry popcorn and nice cold beer are enough to bring me back here alone.Happy hour is alright, either way you'll find loads of savory options for the cheap. Get a good mix of the Kushiyaki skewers at $3 bucks each - grilled veggies, seafood, and meats. I sampled some of the spicy hot pot, fried tofu in a broth of soy sauce, and the Tako Kimchee (raw wasabi-flavored octopus) was actually quite tasty - a bit crunchy. Grab a seat either at the bar or outside if you can. The bartender that evening was fun to watch mix drinks, was great at keeping our drinks and plates full. Kushibar deserves a visit from me again. I think this place has some potential but isn't quite there. &#160;Tried some chicken skewers and a plate of shrimp. They had some good flavors and cooked well but I think pretty much everything was a little over seasoned. Even the complimentary popcorn was way too salty. &#160;There were a few kernels seasoned well and those were quite tasty but for the most part there was just too much making it hard to eat at times. &#160;Was expecting it to be a quick service kind of place but found it to be rather slow, even though it wasn't busy. Came here for some after dinner drinks. &#160;Loved that you get a bowl of popcorn to munch on before ordering. &#160;Not sure how that fits in with sushi, but it went great with our drinks. &#160;Service was good and attentive. &#160;There was a DJ when we were there. &#160;I liked the warehouse layout of the place - gave it a good vibe. This restaurant has some interesting items on the menu. &#160;I wasn't expecting an array of different types of skewers but apparently this is the place to find it. The skewers were really good and the coleslaw served was a nice complement. I would go during happy hour because you can get assorted meats when ordering the House Set or the Seafood Set on a discounted price. &#160;Besides the skewers there were a lot of noodle dishes on the menu - udon, ramen, soba. &#160;Many soup based but we ordered a stir fry version since it was a hot day. &#160;That was delicious!For a cool and refreshing drinks, i recommend trying the lychee lemonade and cucumber daiquiri! This place has a cool japanese vibe... &#160;I would highly recommend the crispy salmon skin handroll... delish! &#160;Wow i could eat 5 of those. &#160;The Kim Chi udon was good and the sashimi plate had fresh tasty fish. &#160;I didnt care for the pork bell skewer however... a little tough and just not like pork belly... &#160;The curry popcorn was a surprise, really addicting actually. &#160;The &#160;patio is very nice, its actually not out door since its covered by has the open air feel. &#160;Great for groups, Overall very nice! we were taken here by a local. kushibar sits 3-4 blocks from his doorsteps and if it's before amateur hour (Friday 9-10PM or whenever the drunk frat boys start arriving) he'll be at the bar having a beer and some happy hour nibbles. we sat at the bar, our bowl of curry popcorn and our beers were rarely empty and they had decent vegetarian options that could be made vegan upon request. our bartender informed us that they're working on more vegan menu items. (A+) the dr. and i shared the veggie udon stirfry with tofu which i really liked but he found a bit too eerily fishy. we also had the grilled shitake and the green onion skewers which were nice, smokey and not burnt or too charred. the atmosphere is nice and clean and i didn't notice the additional covered patio seating until after we left but that looked cute too. yay for friendly staff and awesome eats! My favorite waitress is Keomi (spelling errors aside). She's cute, sweet and definitely knows how to take care of her patrons. Get on her good side, and throw her a jab. She'll play along and have fun with you.I've patroned Kushibar several times. Both for the food, and for the drinks. The kimchi fried rice is by far, some of the tastiest in town. If you want to go for one of the udons, they're legit.The drinks are standard fare - nothing really stood out in my mind, except for the fact that they're decently priced (especially the Japanese commercial brews).Kushibar is definitely versatile - a night out with friends, for birthdays, dates and just plain getting drunk. I have, and I will.Oh, and thanks for the free green tea birthday ice cream! &#160;I'll make sure you get more of my drunk patronage next time I'm in town. Honestly it is not that this place is bad, but I wasn't really impressed at all. Went here on a Saturday night during late night happy hour. Had a couple of the combination platters off the happy hour. Most of the kushiyaki just tasted dry and salty. Miso was good, as was the kimchi fried rice. I had a lychee saketini which was probably the highlight of the food and beverage experience. Belltown on a weekend is already a mixed bag. We didn't have to wait too long for a table, but service was a little slow, because they were a bit understaffed. There seemed to be one waitress who was serving the entire deck area. The bartender was not exactly with it, but apologized and corrected his mistakes in our orders. The space is sparse, industrial, and LOUD. It's almost like a club with food instead of a dance floor. Not my taste, but I guess it works for Belltown. I really like Kushiyaki, but I'm going to keep looking elsewhere. I give it 3 stars, because I've only been there once. I had the spicy nabeyaki and it was really quite good. Hot, bubbly, and full of yakisoba, veggies and meat. &#160;Service was attentive and very quick. All signs point to this being a good lunch spot, so &#160;I will be going back for more. (and hopefully raising the star rating. Good happy hour. Prices were ok. The outside eating area is nice on a good day. All in all it was ok. Their food isn't that great. Their drinks aren't extraordinary. I like their lychee sake though, not many bars have it.The service could be better. The waitress wasn't that great at offering options or offering a friendly answer to simple questions. I like the fact that they have a "patio" area where you can be comfortable enough to chat with your friends and not bothered by the boisterous crowds that can sometimes rush in through the inside bar area.Easy-going atmosphere, no need to feel like you need to be all dolled up when you just want to sit back and drink. The prices are kinda steep, but the food is of excellent quality. The bf and I go here anytime we're feeling like healthy Japanese that isn't sushi. There's this big savory pancake (okonomiyaki, I think?) that my bf swears by, but I don't really see the appeal. The drinks are interesting, but again, a bit expensive. If I'm going to throw down $80 for dinner and drinks, I'd probably choose Kushibar's sister restaurant, Umi. Awesome wood porch! Great atmosphere for beer and yakitori, I loved the albacore!! Could easily become a favorite if I lived in Seattle. LOVE the free curry popcorn for the table, what a great snack! Meat on a stick, how can you go wrong! Decided to finally try this place out since we always past it on the way to Wasabi Bistro. I was excited to try it out but eh it was alright. We came here for a late night dinner/snack after a party and each of us ordered from their selection of kushiyaki skewers. I personally ordered the tonkotsu ramen and pork belly skewer to share. The tonkotsu ramen came in a big bowl which was nice to see but the broth was a little too salty for me (which is surprising b/c I love salt). I did like how the ramen was cooked perfectly, al-dente.. but I honestly prefer Samurai's better. My pork belly was disappointing.. it was so tough and chewy that I hardly could pull it off of the skewer. The flavor was there but actually disgesting it was very challenging and I only had half before I gave up on it. Also, we sat in the area to the left of the restaurant where it looked like a long outdoor shed but see-thru that you can watch people walk by. At one point a group of people decided to take a smoke break that they opened one of the panels which caused a chilly breeze to come thru to our table.. eventually one of the waiters came and closed it and told them to don't touch. Thank goodness...I am glad I tried it though but don't plan on going back anytime soon. Probably would have been nicer sitting on the porch. Enjoyed the curry popcorn and black sesame ice cream!Was expecting there to be sushi because of the name, but what they offered (tako yaki, udon noodles, other Japanese cuisine) was just as good. This place was practically empty during lunchtime on a Monday... but that didn't deter me from trying it out. Through a friend's recommendation, I decided to give their ramen a try. House ramen. $8 for a bowl big enough to bathe my cat. Split it with a friend and it'll cost you another $2. Seaweed, corn, tender slices of chicken, half of a hard-boiled egg, and noodles that were so perfect in texture (firm with just the right amount of chewiness)...I couldn't put down my chopsticks. When Seattle gets cold and you're in Belltown, this is the place to go.PS: The menu also offers Japanese "street food" which translates to lots and lots of skewers. Chicken. Scallops. Shrimps. Vegetables. They have a whole page in the back of the menu dedicated to these small bites ($3/skewer) After having walked past the little outdoor seating area about a hundred times, my wife and I finally stopped into Kushibar for a quick dinner. It was a Monday night so it wasn't very busy. The service was prompt, helpful without being intrusive, and generally very friendly.The food itself, however, was a mixed bag. The vegetable croquettes were delicious but really, take some vegetables, roll them in mashed potatoes, and deep fry. Hard to go wrong. The sesame wasabi dressing was also quite good on the salad and something I definitely plan to recreate (or at least try to) at home. Most everything else, however, was rather mediocre. The fish collar was ok albeit a bit dry. The kimchi fried rice was decent enough although I could have used a little more heat. We also got a plate of skewered meats and with the exception of the scallops, most of the stuff was somewhere between average and outright bad.If a bunch of friends wanted to go, I wouldn't object and I'm sure it would be a fun place on a warm night, with lots of friends but as the wife and I both agreed, "well, I guess we can take it off our list." Went to this restaurant on a Tuesday afternoon after work- not very busy so the service was great, although I could see that the service could start to lack if it did get busy. We arrived during happy hour but didn't necessarily order from the happy hour menu. This restaurant has a cute, well decorated interior with edgy artwork and nice hardwood floors. The style of food that is served are small meats/veggies grilled on skewers along with other traditional Japanese side dishes.... INSERT POPCORN APPETIZER HERE. Wait, what?! yeah, popcorn. right out of left field. I would have cared more if I wasn't so hungry at the time. My friend and I ordered the Agedashi Tofu, Takoyaki, Sashimi Platter, and the Meat/Fish Platter. All of the food was great- the Sashimi melted on your tongue and the Takoyaki was very delicious. A bit pricey in comparison with my usual spots but still a great place to try at least once. Very healthy food (since everything is grilled).
If you don't have a lot of money: say you are a student or you work in a less than glamorous job; this is where you should go when you crave sushi. &#160;If you do have a lot of money you can either go to one of those fancy places and pay double, triple, or maybe quadruple the price for (probably) inferior stuff or you can come here...your choice.Because you don't care so much about polished interiors mood lighting and an uber chic staff you will be rewarded with really delicious sushi for not very much money and all the hot tea you can drink in your very own table side carafe. My sushi-companion and I tried a spicy tuna roll, a half california roll, a piece of tamago (they gave me two pieces for the price of one because they said the piece was too small - it looked normal to me), the sushi nigiri (assorted plate) and a salmon ball (actually two balls). &#160;Everything was delicious, we are not wimps, we were hungry and we left with (over) full stomachs and two small boxes of leftovers in tow.The bill was $20.00. I stopped going to other Japanese restaurant after I found this one, not because it is very close to my place (I don't mind driving a long way for good food. :)). &#160;The food is great there. &#160;The price is very reasonable. &#160;The only reason I marked 4 stars is it takes really long from you getting there till you get the food. &#160;There are always many people waiting. &#160;Try the phone order? &#160;It works like 1/10 dials. &#160;The line is busy. &#160;Other than this, everything is great. &#160;You will fall in love with this place. Oh, don't forget to try out the the chi-la-shi, which is not on the menu. &#160;That is my favorite. The place is tiny and crowded. The wait is eternal. But goddamn, this has got to be the FRESHEST tastiest sushi in North America.AND.It's cheap.I'm not from Seattle, but I wouldn't mind going to Seattle just for Musashi's sushi. Why did I never go here before? &#160;Because my wife was scared of it.Why did we go last night? &#160;My wife's friend Ivy threatened her if she did not go.The was the only place in Washington I've been to that made me feel like I was back in my old neighborhood in Tokyo. &#160;You get one killer plate of sushi here for $10.50. &#160;You get great nigiri for $1.50 a piece. &#160;Fresh fresh fish. &#160;Mostly perfectly done (one bit of tuna had bloodline still in the cut). &#160;I'll give you some slack form $1.00 though, given that there were 10 pieces of fish on the Nigiri Plate.My wife got the bento which had one skewer of teriyaki that transported me right back to Nishi-Ojima. &#160;American teriyaki is too sweet, too sauced, and too overdone. &#160;This was pure, light, grilled, and honest. &#160;And that was worth any amount of waiting.So we left spending $22 and were stuffed.I wouldn't be surprised to find myself back here many times in the very near future.Thank you Musashi's for giving me a short trip back to Ojima without having to get on a plane, take the train into Tokyo, transfer to the Shinjuku line at Shinjuku station, and ride to Nisha Ojima, take the Meiji Doru North Exit, turn left, cross the street and walk half a block down to my favorite Teriyaki on earth. FRESH! FRESH! FRESH!We went here based on a recommendation from our "local" friends. The fish was very fresh, probably the freshest sushi I have ever tasted and at the best price in the city. Ambiance doesn't exist, but at these prices who cares?I cannot give this place 5 stars because I was disappointed in the variety of rolls and also the sanitation of the kitchen. Maybe sitting at the bar wasn't the best idea. I've eaten here a few times. The sushi is far, far superior to the rubbish that passes for sushi on the Ave. If I had a complaint, it's that the restaurant can be swelteringly hot during the summer without AC, or even an open door.Note: The Sukiyaki listed on the menu is just udon rice with sukiyaki meat on top of it. It's not nabemono-styled Sukiyaki in an iron pot with veggies and an egg. One of my cherished spots to consume the raw fishy goodness they serve.If you want to sit on a tatami mat, listen annoyingly bad jazz &#160;or eat some overpriced sushi go somewhere else. If you like the feeling of a mom and pop spot with some of the freshest fish you'll get anywhere at an ultra cheap price then come here. &#160;I wish they were open 7 days a week (closed Sunday and Monday) but these folks need a break!I swear the lady making the sushi always looks like she's in a panic. Try the Chirashi bowl, not on the menu, but damn good. Sure sometimes you'll have to wait 15 or 20 minutes but you can always go across the street to the cheesy wine spot or better yet, have an engaging conversation with the one you love because that's the only type of people you should be turning onto this place. This place is awesome. By far the best sushi value in Seattle. They get busy so make &#160;sure you have time to wait if you're trying to eat there. I usually call in my order and take it home but sometimes that doesn't even work because they get so busy they take the phone off the hook. If you are taking someone on a date it is a great place because it's small and intimate and it makes you look like you really know the "restaurant hidden gems". Make sure to bring cash though. They do not take plastic!Recommendations: Musashi california roll, negihama roll, and really, everything else... Been up and down 45th many times and never noticed this sushi spot! Tip 1: Get there early. After 5:30 you will wait for a table in a very small space. Tip 2: They try to rush you in and out to make up for the hungry people waiting in the said very small space. Can't blame em, but you have to be firm to take your time. Tip 3: Order tons of food so they stop trying to rush you when they realize you are worth their time in revenue. Tip 4: Order tons of food because it is fresh &amp; delicious!! Recommended sampling from our dinner: tuna, salmon, eel &amp; octopus sashimi. California and spicy tuna rolls. Vegetable skewers. Miso soup. **Octopus was my favorite - amazingly good, fresh and the texture is perfectly chewy** They have a thermos of green tea on each table (kind of a diner/asian fusion presentation). Bring cash or check to pay, leave your claustrophobia at home, come hungry and enjoy the plethora of arts marketing posters on the wall. Best sashimi ever ..... The place has the hole in the wall feeling to it. &#160;The place is cheap, amazing food, prompt service. &#160;The house warm sake is awesome ! ... I ordered assortment of sashimi of all possible kinds and had some of the best food I have had in Seattle. &#160;Specially the unagi (eel) ones were mouth watering ... so good that I ordered another round of just unagi ones. &#160;The octupus was ok but not that great though. &#160;The rest of the fishes were awesome. &#160;I wish that salmon was wild caught instead of farm raised though.Possible improvements would be to have option of brown rice (I love brown rice and don't eat white rice), have wild caught salmon instead of farm raised.In terms of prices, I had at least 25 pieces of sashimi, 1 chicken skewer, 1 small sake and my bill was under $25. &#160;That's so cheap as compared to other Japaneses restaurants in Seattle. Four stars for the quality of food vs. the price. &#160;Sure, it's small, a little gritty, and you have to wait a bit during the busy dining times - but the chirashi here is a dish you can't find for a better price. &#160;The $12.50 bowl of rice topped with a variety of fish (salmon, eel, tuna, scallops, etc.) cannot be beat. &#160;Two people can EASILY be stuffed for $25.The wait staff is courteous if you are. &#160;They are busy all day long so give 'em a break!The Sunday and Monday closures are typical of a lot of japanese restaurants so it shouldn't be a surprise to anybody, but if they were open more often, i wouldn't be complaining! this is a great intro to sushi place. If you've moved on to trying things more than rolls and nigiri with too much wasabi this isn't the best place for you.Pro-the fish was fresh-you can get nigiri by the piece instead of two piece per order-which mean you can try alot kind for very little money-service once you are seat is prompt and soon you are eating the good stuff-it local favorite and it has a homey feeling-huge rolls, seriously not very authentic but a good dealCons-the seafood was not as fresh as the fish, I left it rather than chance it-the nigiri was not prepared right, the rice was too sticky and way too much wasabi-no sashimi, no gomae, no tofu dishes, no ankimo, no seasonal specialities all basics that most Japanese places in the US have.-this isn't a place where you can take your time and enjoy itI can totally see why it is beloved by people and if someone else wanted to go there, I would but I wouldn't be coming here be myself, It reminded me of American Chinese places in the 70's where they gave you knifes and forks and most of the dishes were made up for Americans. You know how people often joke about waiting in line to get into heaven? Well if you're looking for fresh sushi, think of Musashi's as heaven. You have to wait in a ridiculously long line, and you know it's going to be crowded beyond belief once you DO get in, but you stay in the end to get to your rightful place through the pearly gates. And your reward at the end of it all? A welcoming spot into Musashi's humble, yet heavenly abode and their eternally, mouth-watering fresh sashimi. Heaven was never so delicious! I was prepared on Friday night to wait for my sushi take-out forever... forever was 5 minutes... literally... and that was with a billion people waiting outside in the cold with me. Bundled up in my northface I had decided I had put off going long enough and made the detour for sushi take-out. Parking was not fun on 45th, but I already knew that. I ordered a tuna roll and a yellow fin roll + miso soup promising myself that I would be back for the sampler- it has everything and is 10.50* The bag seems light when I was given my order and I was prepared to be disappointed. I discovered when I got home that I had not 6 pieces of each roll like described- but 8! Heck yes~ I instantly ate like 4 when I was prepping my little dinner eating set up just because of this find. The rolls were 2.80 each! I was able to eat about 4 pieces every hour that night because I kept filling up. The fish was fresh and rolls yummy- the texture had moments of greatness and moments of me wishing it was better. Now that I have figured out that for 2.80(a filling roll) + 1.00(miso soup) I can eat quick like a bunny on the way home I am in love. Remember cash only... or check.UPDATE- My roommate and I both have gotten pretty back quality fish here lately in our take-out. I don't have any desire to buy their sashimi anymore and the thought of the spicy tuna roll make me wrinkle my nose... I drove past this place several times with friends and noticed there was always a line out the door so I had to check it out. They are closed on Sundays and Mondays, which I found out the hardway. The way they have people lined up you'd figure they'd be open as many as hours as they can...Anyway, the food was moderately cheap and decent, but not the best sushi I've ever had. Definitely a good spot if you live in the neighborhood but I wouldn't drive too far to get here very often. Great price for decent sushi.The sushi is good, but certainly not the best in town. &#160;Possibly the best value for the money in town though. &#160;The downside is the tiny location and wait to get in the door. tiny, packed, a bit grotty but awesome. &#160;for the price, you can't beat it.
Just giving a shout-out for their About Business section!I definitely appreciate and think it's awesome that they've made those decisions. Sometimes it's nice and can pay off when "going off the main road", etc.With that said, and these recent reviews, I think I'll do lunch again sometime soon. They have redeemed themselves in my book and I will be going here more often from now on. &#160;We placed our large order the day before as we wanted to pick it up at 11:00 when they opened. &#160;They graciously took our order, repeated it back to us, asked if we could arrive at 11:15am, and said that they would see us tomorrow. &#160;We arrived exactly on time but the food wasn't ready yet. &#160;The lady at the counter thought the time was 11:20 but it didn't really matter. &#160;When the order was ready they counted each item to make sure that everything was in order, we paid and left. The food was SO GOOD! &#160;It was still warm since we don't work too far away from here and everyone got exactly what they ordered. &#160;I am so glad the service has improved since last time because this was one of my favorites! Woohoo for Pacific HK Cafe. 3.5Awesome chicken wings... almost as good as my mommy's.Everything my friends ordered was good... from the fired rice to the baked noodles but my ordered one of my favorite dishes, &#160;the black pepper sizzling udon noodles but it was way too too greasy. I've loved this place in the past, but things have gone downhill recently. &#160;The food quality is lacking and certainly doesn't justify the price. &#160;$9 for a Cantonese style soup noodle? &#160;Only if it's top notch - which it certainly is not.The service is what you'd expect from a HK style diner. &#160;Nothing to write home about, but not bad. &#160;We once waited 45 minute for our food only to find out that they forgot about it. &#160;Big time fail, but I understand sometimes things like that happen.Their desserts are their strong suit. &#160;GREAT HK style desserts. &#160;If you haven't had HK style sago or mango, give it a try! &#160;It's light, flavorful, and gives you a very different texture than western desserts.The dessert elevates my rating to 3 stars, otherwise, it's just a 2. Whenever I'm in Chinatown, I have this mind boggling routine where I'll walk around looking for a spot to eat. I'll walk and walk and always end up at the doors of Pacific Cafe. I don't know why I do that when I could just save 15 mins of my time haha.The best part about this place is the legit Hong Kong food. But it's not limited to just the food and drinks, the deserts are also authentic Hong Kong styled - something I haven't encountered elsewhere since I moved to Seattle. The food is good and doesn't have as much MSG as many other places around here (PURPLE DOT) and the wait staff is pretty chill. Another thing i appreciate about this joint is that they don't skimp you on the meat portions. Too many restaurants do this, especially during lunch hours. That alone gives Pacific Cafe an extra half star in my books.My only problem with this place is that the appetizers are too damn delicious and I end up spending more than I wanted! It's ok, my wallet frowns but my belly smiles - it's a fair trade-off.Overall Pacific Cafe is built off of a winning formula: Inexpensive + tasty + real HK food. Sounds good to me! Chaos in the "Kitchen" and it was painful to watch. A co-worker and I came here for the 12 o' clock lunch hour. We walked in and were seated right away. We were served tea and for about 10 minutes we browsed the menu and waited for someone to take our order. The 2 people next to us walked in after us but they got to order first because one of them spoke the language. I guess they had an advantage with that one. I decided to wave one of the servers down to get her attention. I ordered the #15 oven bake. My co-worker ordered a noodle dish. While we waited again we saw one of the workers fall on the floor. She was wearing flip flops...probably not the best footwear when running around. More customers started coming in. A couple of guys sat next to us but they didn't get their menus. They probably sat there for more than 5 minutes and one of them finally spoke up and got the server's attention. My co-worker got her noodle dish. I didn't get mine yet. She said that it needed hot sauce. She tried to wave a server down but it was so busy/chaotic that the server didn't stop to hear her request. Eventually a server came back to the area and she got to ask for hot sauce. About 5 minutes later I got my oven bake. It was okay. It was my first time trying something like that so I can't complain. Even paying for our food was difficult. I saw many order tickets scattered across the counter. We stood there for probably 2 minutes and finally someone helped us. I think if I were to come back I would just order my food to go. I love HK-nese cafe food. &#160;I came here with my family and some family friends for dinner. &#160;We had the meat lover's dinner and the seafood lover's dinner.The menu sounded so good, but everything was really &#160;inauthentic. &#160;It wasn't prepared to proper HK style at all. The shrimp and egg rice ribbons were stuck together in a clump.I was so disappointed. &#160;Go to Purple Dot instead. Amazing dumplings in the soup for only $5! Curry rice dish was an adequate serving for one but the not very spicy and the portion of meat and potatoes were too small. My boyfriend and I were looking for a quick bite to eat. &#160;We were starving! &#160;This place was kind of empty, so we thought it would be quick. &#160;WRONG! &#160;We waited what felt like 40 min. for soup and an entree. &#160;The server never once checked on us or stopped by to let us now our food was taking long. &#160;Once we got the food, it was pretty good. &#160;I wish I could give this place 4 stars for the food, but the wait and the lack of service really didn't sit well with me.I don't think I'll go back. The fried garlic chicken appetizers are a specialty, so be sure to order some while you look the menu over. Prices are reasonable for the amount you get. Be sure to check this place out for the 2-person dinner deal: three dishes (total), dessert (for both), and drink (for both) for a little over $20. WORTH IT. This is one of my FAVORITE chinese restaurants. Everything I've ordered is authentic and DELICIOUS. The price isn't too bad either. The only unfortunate thing is, it's in a pretty ugly area and I always get hassled by homeless people. My favorite chinese cafe in seattle, hands down. Service is a little slow, not because of the attentive wait staff, but because the kitchen is just slow. They seem to be getting a little better, but I would risk it if you're in a hurry. Used to be cash only, but they take plastic now, which is great because many a times I've wanted to go there and realized i had zero cash on me and stopping at the ATM is just not convenient. I love their curry, either chicken or brisket, coffee/milktea is yummmmm, their noodles and baked rice are all super delicious. Oh, salt/pepper/garlic chicken wings are the death of me! Shanghai noodles are good, steaks with black bean sauce are good. OK, I think I've just listed off every menu item. So, just go and enjoy. Authentic cantonese food, and everything is delicious! Today walking though the International District we stumbled upon this place. I must admit that I am sometimes leary about eating Chines food - never knowing if it is truly vegetarian. But here on the menu it was clearly marked what items were vegetarian and what was not. So we thought we would give it a try. We were quickly greeted and taken to a table and poured us some hot tea. That was a nice touch, something warm to drink (Seattle is still brisk this time of year). We started with the Veggie Spring Rolls that came out quickly and were crispy and light with a sweet chilly sauce to dip them in. As my entree I had the Singapore Noodles with Veggies and Tofu. It was tasty, nice and light (not coated in a heavy sauce). There was a nice array of veggies along with strips of tofu. My husband ordered the Seafood Bake, and it came out a few minutes later because of its cooking time. He said that his seafood was fresh tasting in a light white sauce over a lightly fried rice. The bottom of the rice was crispy from baking in the dish, and the dish overall was piping hot strait from the oven. He enjoyed it so much he ate the entire thing. We never got around to dessert. We were too full from our meal but from what we saw they looked yummy. I want to go back just for one of them next time. The also had an extensive list of juices and smoothies available ...and you can add Basil Seed to any of them. Something I have tried in the past and thought it was real neat, although I do not see it too often. We will be going back, not just to try dessert. The food was great - I cannot wait to try something else.
Tickled to find a good breakfast in Magnolia - because there aren't any others. Great home cooking - thin potatoes and two great eggs. Coffee, orange juice and the Greek language.Perfect early morning.
Dude...it's Pho...Pho is pretty good even when it is not great. &#160;It's kind of like sex right?I am giving this place 3 stars for that alone.This place is in the food court up on 3rd, I have boycotted it because I heard that it wasn't great.I love me some International District Pho, some Tacoma Pho, even some crappy Spanaway Pho...But this place had some weird meat Pho. &#160;The noodles were a bit more undercooked, portions were huge and one size. &#160;It smelled good, the broth was good, and in a pinch in the pouring rain I will probably walk back.But the hike to the ID is worth it, plus you get the added time for your Buddha Belly to go down from the expansive amount of Pho you just shoved in it.Oh and on a side note, their menu on the wall is in the font that Disney uses...I swear! I'm not here for their Pho, but for their Vietnamese sandwiches packed with pork, veggies, cilantro and secret sauce. &#160;It's a bit more expensive than other places that offer this type of sandwich but the ingredients is better. &#160;Plus, the place is clean. So the 4 stars is for the Pork Sandwich only.I'd give 2 stars for their pho.Maybe they should rename to "Cafe Pork Sandwich, Biotch!" Ouch on the other reviews. &#160;I used to work down the street and I've had Pho at almost every place in Seattle (Pho Bac, Cyclo, Pho Hoa, Than &#160;Brothers) and so far Cafe Pho serves the best standard beef pho I have found with a tasty broth and fresh basil and sprouts. &#160;I wish they will offer tripe and fatty flank and some of the other delicacies though but for what you get (and you get it fast too), it's well worth the $6.35 especially when compared to the other choices in the food court and in that area in general.The owner is also very nice and you receive prompt service with ice water and a steaming hot bowl of Pho within minutes of sitting down. &#160;I have tried some of the meats over vermicelli and can attest that they aren't bad either although I would skip anything with chicken there (who eats chicken at a true Pho place anyways?!) This is just another mediocre pho place. &#160;Not horrible, not great. &#160;Just OK. &#160;It's the only place near work I can get pho, so I come here from time to time for lack of better options. &#160;I always order the pho tai. &#160;Their broth is pretty good, but could use more depth and flavor. &#160;I guess that's what the chili paste is for, eh? &#160;There's really nothing that stands out about their pho, good or bad. &#160;I wish they offered more than one size, which is too bad. &#160;Service is quick and efficient, even during the height of lunch rush.UPDATE 4/10/07:I ordered a non-pho item and what a mistake it was. &#160;Makes their pho seem like a delicacy. &#160;I ordered the "boneless chicken" served atop vermicelli noodles, lettuce, basil, and veggies. &#160;It comes with a clear fish sauce (nuoc cham I think it's called) that is sweeter than it is salty that you're supposed to pour over the whole dish. &#160; I hate the sauce. &#160;It's sickeningly sweet. &#160;Chicken should not be sweet. &#160;And when I ordered "boneless chicken," I was under the impression that I was getting white meat. &#160;What I got instead were overcooked slabs of dark meat that were dry and gristly. &#160;It tasted like ass. &#160;Old ass. &#160;I was starving so I ate some of it, but as my hunger diminished, my disgust overtook me and I left the rest of the dish untouched. I work right near here, so I come for pho. Try to arrive early. After noon, it's nearly impossible to get a table, and the line sometimes stretches out the door.Oh, and have the combination pho. Don't be deceived: this may be the only place not crowded in this food court but it will fill quickly. &#160;Do not think you can take a four-top to leisurely read your paper and eat your lunch. &#160;You will be sitting there as a table-hog while the whole place has filled. &#160;You place your order (you must be able to make quick decisions) and then you get a number placard to place on your table to have your food delivered. &#160;Here's a weird part: a busboy then takes your number placard, as well as your receipt. &#160;So if you need your receipt you'll need to figure something out.This is one of those places that places a surcharge on debit/credit charges under $10 (fifty cents).The food? &#160;Eh. &#160;Seemed to be basic pho. &#160;Certainly not destination food. Nice sit in Pho place for the days I'm sick of fast food on the bottom floor and want to hike up to the second level of this food court. &#160;The Vietnamese sandwiches are good and so is the Pho. &#160;Extremely fast and efficient. &#160;4 starts only cause I like the extremely cheap Pho down by the U-district way more. &#160;They have much bigger portions too. tried the chicken pho (aka, chicken noddle soup). it was pretty good. they came out with the dish pretty quick so that was nice. a nice meal for someone who doesnt want to eat anything real fattening for lunch.Rock!Update: Today I had the pork Banh Mi because I was craving it the last few days. It was pretty good. About $4 for the sandwich, which is a little expensive considering they are usually $2-3, but it was a pretty good size. Zipzap Zubidy Bop! Today was a good Pho day, it's rainy and dreary and chilly outside. &#160;I don't know why I didn't go for another Bhan Mi but I didn't I went for the Pho Ga. &#160;The Pho here isn't great, it's not really good it's just ok and for the price $6.35 not worth it and they only have one size, I don't think they realize one size does not fit all. &#160;The broth was bland no flavor to it and the chicken didn't taste like chicken it actually didn't taste much like anything but it was chicken at least I'm pretty sure it was on a plus side the basil was all green and no brown which was nice but all together the Pho was lacking a lot of flavor. &#160;Next time I'll bet a Bhan Mi I know they are good and tasty and they listen to me when I say no cucumbers. &#160;Go for the Bahn Mi not the Pho. Taste like pho from the city. &#160;Maybe a bit on the salty side but still ok. &#160;Got the meat combo. &#160;I think its everything except chicken which is weird when you're thinking meat combo. &#160;Quick service as with most vietnamese places. &#160;I like the order first, then sit concept. &#160;Reduces the amount of time between sitting and eating.
A generic corporate Irish bar. Been a few times, solo and with big groups. I've never had the food or sat in the restaurant. The only real annoyance I've encountered is the music is a bit too loud, as most places like this, at times. I may end up going back, but I tend to prefer more quite places like White Horse which is right next door. It's in the middle of Post Alley in the market, just up the way from Cafe Campagne, and it's a nice place to catch a pint. &#160;They have been around for awhile, so the brass and wood inside has a nice patina to it. &#160;It's a little more costly than some other pubs around, but hey, they serve pasties here, which make up for it. &#160;It's been awhile since I've been here, but it's about time I go back. Lots of Tall...Lots of Handsome....Lots of Soccer Players....Which makes me question why the heck I am not here more often....Ohhh and lots of beer. &#160;Which quenches the thirst of the three above mentioned attributes of Kells. I was in the pub section,I don't drink, I was their for Penny arcade game expo afterparty with the &#160;hosts of The Totally Rad Show (pod cast) It's was packed with live Irish music. The wait staff was slow and took forever but was really busy. It was best to go to the bar area to get your drink then to rely on the waitress. I ordered a Shepereds pie that hit the spot but the side of veggys were over cooked. &#160;I don't know if the party was 5 star and meeting new friends or the venue. We did enjoy the music as druckin geeks were attemping to do a drunkin stuper of a irish jig .the food was good thought there was no Bar food,the people did drink said that they couldn't belive they did not have microbrews on tap (though he was from portland) but everyone was drinking Gennius and i was drinking a Cola that was filled with ice so acouple of sips and it was gone. I would not go out of my way to go here but i would not mind comming back. If I was into inebriated frat boys, I'd be knee deep in drunken but regrettable debauchery. If I was into middle aged gentlemen, I'd be inundated with supposed suave high end beer drinkers. Needless to say neither of these types are appealing to me. Kell's on a Friday night is about as diverse as the audience at a Casey Treat sermon. Kell's isn't the place to go for an intimate conversation, a night out for a few drinks in a comfortable environment. If you want to pretend you are in an authentic Irish pub this isn't the place for you either. Rather if you want to get the wrong idea of an authentic Irish bar this is the place for you. &#160;Kell's finest point is the beer. The live music wasn't half bad either but I'm partial to the fiddle. It was oddly erotic to witness the guitar player of the band give birthday spankings to a drunk birthday girl. Those slaps sure did reverberate through the bar. I would rather visit Kell's on a weekday to avoid the sausage fest. If only it was a crowd of boys that I'd be interested in. "Did you eat paint chips as a kid?" -Tommy BoyWell I did at Kell's over the weekend. &#160;Yep, floating in my beloved Stoli &amp; Soda with lemon were several chips, flakes swimming around. &#160;Luckily they were spotted only after a couple of sips, but that was such a bummer. &#160;But even with this instance over the weekend, when I lived in Seattle I had many a debacherous night in Kell's. &#160;Always a story when you leave here. &#160;Irish singing of songs even if you aren't Irish, lots of carbombs, too many shots of whisky and so many St. Paddy's Days spent here. &#160;Even paint chips won't keep me away, Kell's. This is a great place located down an alley off of First Street. &#160;It was a great bar that was comfortably crowded. &#160;I didn't have to wait in line forever to buy a beer and they had a great Irish band the night I was there. I normally do not enjoy Irish pubs, but Kells was a must after dinner for my friend's birthday....and who am I to say no to the birthday boy? &#160; &#160;The environment is about the same as most Irish pubs, finding seats were pretty easy. Although I wish this one fat ho bag did not feel the need to take a table for four all to herself when it was damn clear our table next to her had 12 people sitting at a table for 8. &#160;Actually some of us had to split up which broke up the group vibe.  &#160;Anyway I think we came on our servers first day because she was extremely slow at getting drinks and half the time got them wrong. She was however nice, so I'll give her that. &#160;Music was some live Irish band, sounds nice, not my thing. EXTREMELY loud. About 30 minutes into the live band...Sorry Dave...I'm out.~G I like a well-poured pint of the black stuff and the bar staff at kells knows what they're about. &#160;Things I like about Kells:-great import selection on draught-friendly ownership; Etta always chats a bit with my wife when she's in-diverse crowd-atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere (the Kells in SF is great too!)-outdoor seating with nice views of Elliot BayThings I'm not too crazy about:-tends to attract the rowdies late night-parking BEST BAR IN SEATTLE. In my opinion. Always great music, in either half. The main half has always had a lot of fun live music, not always my style, but always full of great energy. The right half of the bar is ALWAYS playing great dancing songs...usually by midnight a little dance floor forms at the back of the bar.I think what I love most about Kell's is that everyone is always so happy and friendly. The bartenders make great drinks at reasonable prices. There are a ton of attractive men. It's got a relaxed vibe, not "uppity" like Belltown tends to be. Also, the doorman always lets my friends and I in at a discounted price...sometimes free!AND, last time I was there Lucy Liu was there and we kinda danced together...well. Next to each other. Her hair brushed my arm...it was pretty cool. Great place, nice atmosphere. Been here a few times when in Seattle and it's one of the better local Irish places (GO Celt's), and I like the way they split the bar and dining area. The food is good and the people are friendly. The bathrooms are tiny (as they are in Ireland), but for the most part it's a place I enjoy. I cant attest to most of their offerings. &#160;They get my 4-star rating for one reason: &#160;I've been there multiple times feeling very hungover and left feeling like a million bucks after a cup of soup and a beer. &#160;Plus, friendly staff. &#160;Great place for such a purpose. This place is a blast. Most memorably, I went to the spanish music night upstairs and it was totally crazy. &#160;Everyone was dancing, happy, spanish people were singing along, and literally demanded an "encore" from the DJ at the end of the night by chanting/shouting. &#160;I've never seen that and it's the opposite of what you read people say about bars with dancing in this town.Other than that with that crowds this place attracts, you are bound to meet someone or find someone you know. I wish I could pack this place up and move it to Phoenix. After spending my entire paycheck here in the summer of '03, I consider this the absolute best bar I've ever been to. Great service, good salads before the drinking, spectacular crowds and Liam (well, not sure if he's still there) and his live music five days a week.If you visit Seattle, you MUST visit Kells, even if they don't still carry my fav Irish Red on tap. There were green alligators *long arm clap* and long-necked geese *one hand up* Some humpty-backed camels *hunchover* and some chimpanzees *fingers to pits*, Some cats and rats *cat eyes and whiskers* and elephants *arm trunk*, But sure as you're born *rock baby* The loveliest of them all was the Unicorn *put beer on forehead* (now take a drink)Head to Kell's in Post Alley for a good ole Irish sing-a-long which is never a bad time. Add alcohol and yep everything is funnier. Just try and be unhappy at Kell's doing the actions to the Unicorn song. You simply can't do it. There's a $5 cover and I suggest you get there early for a table. &#160;Even if you aren't a big drinker, arrange a designated driver or take a cab. For some reason the Guinness tastes better at Kell's. Makes me wish I was Irish.*The Unicorn song was written by children's author Shel Silverstein, this song was popularized by the Irish Rovers in the 60's I've had mixed results here. Sometimes fun. Sometimes the clientele are mean and abrasive. I like it, I was introduced to Kells on a date. I have gone back many times. Family, Friends and Business have all had a time or three in Kells. During the day hours and dinner hours it is relaxing and enjoyable. During the night its like somebody let a frat party in. &#160; &#160;Food wise it is much better Irish Fare than other Irish pubs I have been to or frequent. I like it for a quick dinner if I'm in the area. During the summer I have wasted a few afternoons on the alley sipping a drink and watching people pass.  &#160; &#160;Kells is a place I like to go to, I'm not there often enough to take notes of every fault, so for me it still has that new bar and old beer smell. Stop in and have a pint. Met some friends here today for lunch.Friendly, efficient servers kept my cuppa tea full and let my friends and I linger long after we were done eating. &#160;Decent Irish soda bread served pre-meal. &#160;My chicken pasty was well nice.Unfortunately, all lunch entr&#233;es are served with the soup-of-the-day. &#160;Today's soup was Vegetable Beef. &#160;I don't eat beef. &#160;I asked if there was an alternative. &#160;Was told I could either get the chicken pasty on its own as an appetizer or pay an extra $2 to sub a salad for the soup.That is really bad practice. &#160;There are lots of vegetarians and other non-beef eaters in Seattle. &#160;There are people who, like my husband, eat beef, but are allergic to onions (which I'm guessing were in that soup). &#160;There are people who just don't like Vegetable Beef Soup. &#160; So all these folks end up eating half a meal or spending more $$$ because they don't want to (or can't) eat the soup choice. Surely at least one alternative could be offered as a substitute (at no extra cost) for this large group of potential customers. &#160; I know this will keep me from rushing back any time soon. It was really crowded. I had lots of Irish car bombs and double Jameson/7's. That's all I remember...Well done boys. Great bar! &#160;We always seem to end up here and the people are very nice. &#160;They have good bands on St. Pat's day. &#160;I don't think I've eaten here, but I rate it 5 star for drink service and the fine people here. Oy vey. I was going to start this review with a snark line "If you're reading this review, you've probably already made this &#160;mistake". But I see 88 reviews and an average of 4.5 stars. Really?!!!I guess locals and tourists alike enjoy Kell's, so I'm sure I missed something the day we visited. I was sure it was a tourist trap, and the service was reminiscent of a place that doesn't worry about enticing locals to return. I was wrong?The food was overpriced, my crap and shrimps salad was $13 for lunch. My boyfriend's irish soup was $8. Neither were excellent, both were slow-coming, and once I did get my food the fork was conveniently missing. I don't feel like going into details. It's not worth it- trust me. There are so many better places in PP Market. Once every three years my friends and I end up in Seattle for a night of drinking and debauchery and once every three years we end up at Kells. &#160;I figured that I would be remiss if I did not write at least a little something about it this time. &#160;Here goes.Of course, Kells is not an authentic Irish pub but that does not bother me the way it might other people. &#160;I am not entirely certain why we always end up at Kells but it definitely is not to feel like we are in Ireland. &#160;We are in Seattle and we all know that. &#160;I remember the last time we were here we did not stick around for very long. &#160;A couple drinks and we were out the door and off to do whatever the hell else we did (I cannot remember and it is not just because it was a long time ago). &#160;This time we apparently decided to plant ourselves in this bar and this bar alone. &#160;It being a Saturday night and all, the downstairs was absolutely packed. &#160;We (and by we I mean all eleven of us) went upstairs where there were only a couple dozen people at around 11 PM. &#160;It was a much better environment for our large group though there was not as much happening. &#160;Our group membership sort of waxed and waned throughout the night though and as usual I ended up spending much of the night outside with the smokers talking about God knows what. &#160;What little time I did spend inside and upstairs was a pleasant enough experience. &#160;Our bartender that night, a man named Fawzi who was apparently of Algerian descent, was making drinks at blinding speed and carrying on as much of a conversation as time would permit (hence how I know he is of Algerian descent); the music was not horrific but was still only generic bar music; and the general atmosphere was pretty relaxed. &#160;There were single women of all shapes and sizes so the single members of our group had plenty of choices. &#160;Also, there did not seem to be any guys my drunken friends wanted to punch which is always a plus. &#160;The only thing that seemed odd was that we were kicked out of the upstairs area around 1:30 AM. &#160;It must just be harder to get people out of there so they probably try to herd them out as early as possible.The last thing I can say is that the drinks were not too expensive. &#160;I bought two rounds and my bill only came to about $70. &#160;We had been drinking before we arrived though so we easily could have spent more. &#160;Anyway, overall I think a good time was had by all.See you in three years, Kells. So being a frequent of Irish pubs....I must admit I enjoyed myself more than I thought I would in a CORPORATE irish pub....My girl suggested we go see OCKHAMS RAZOR down there and I was like UGH...OKGot down there and it was quite packed already by 9. Lucked out with 2 spots at the first bar. It was quite entertaining seeing there 40-some drunk chicks dancing with each other and tryin to be all cute with the bartender.We ordered our Magners and enjoyed the music and the ambiance.Hell when we ordered our next round he said those were on him....BIG PLUS....The only reason I kept this from a 5 star is that it is corporate and it feels like it..... &#160;Didnt try any of the food so I cant say much ado about that..... It's important for everyone to remember that Kells is a restaurant and a pub, those are two separate areas. Most reviewers don't take the time to distinguish what portion of the business they're reviewing. Despite turning 21, I've never bothered with the bar section of Kells. The restaurant half has a really relaxing feel. Everything is wood and warmth. For years I've enjoyed the delicious food, friendly service and good location. My family especially likes to have late breakfasts there when we're shopping at the Market. ::special spot-- &#160;this will always be the spot where I see my old friend get drunk for the first time::Needed a watering hole on a friday night, wandered up and down 1st ave and couldnt find a decent lounge-y bar until it hit me. &#160;I wandered by this bar on a tour earlier and it looked promising.Kell's (same name as a cool spot in sf, which also helps) a nice irish pub with a restaurant attached to it. &#160;Lots of tables, big screen tv at the front of the room with some show of masculinity w/ animal skin covered spherical object with sweaty men (... i think it was basketball that night). &#160;lots of people, great for people-watching.... spent about 20 mins spying on this couple next to us on a horrible date-- poor saps :(4 stars, but extra star for having my favorite beer-- smithwick's :) &#160;5 stars =D I admit it, I l love Kell's. The staff is great, especially the bartenders. Ok ok, I know I'm not suppose to like it because I work in the Market and this is supposedly a place for tourists...but I don't care. Sunday-Thursday this place is awesome. And that is when I go. Tend to stay away on the weekends, especially after 8 or 9. But it's a great place to grab a drink (or several) after work. P.S. The chicken pasty will change your life.
Great as a layover, nice atmosphere and music. Any place that pours a proper pint of Guinness already has 3 stars in my book (you NEED to wait for a good one). On top of that, an atmosphere as dark yet inviting as a stout gets the additional star. &#160;Dern good food too - well as good as Irish food can actually get.Great place for a group to drink the Seattle winters away. In the summer, head across the alley to the Pink Door, where sunlight can actually penetrate. Kells is a lovely place to stumble into after you've already had one too many Stella's. &#160;It's great I say, you walk in grab a bite to eat and wash it down with one more Stella for the road, I mean bus and you're all set. &#160;Everyone there is always warm and friendly and welcoming something so un-Seattle-like if you ask me.That's pretty much all I have to add about the wonderfulness know as Kells. Backstory: When I neared my 21st birthday my father said he would take me anywhere in Portland - but Kells. Seems that those who run the P-Town Kells had asked for an estimate from my father's company for some electrical work, did the work themselves, then told the permit office the shoddy work was done by my father's company. Kells was off-limits to his Irish progeny. I've broken my father's rule about Kells a few times here in Seattle - mostly when I first moved here 10 years ago. I'm not a rule breaker anymore. I would never pick Kells as a place to grab a bite to eat during the weekday - the food isn't worth the effort of Pikes during rush hour. And it's obnoxious on Friday and Saturday nights. It's a bar you have to make plans to go to days in advance as someone is going to have to go early to hold seats. And usually when you go to Kells you end up staying late because a) you don't want to give up the great seats that you got there so early for, b) the food/drinks come slower mid-evening when the frat-holes and sorostitutes show up c) one of your friends will have requested either 'Alice' or the 'Unicorn Song' and has to wait to hear it. Came here for Happy Hour. &#160;Prices weren't cheap (but not horrible considering it was downtown) but the atmosphere was pretty chill. &#160;Only issue was service. &#160;Servers/bartenders had to be hunted down while we were there. This place is hit or miss. It tends to miss at night, but hits during the day. Me and a friend (and also fellow yelper), had lunch(chicken salad) there today. It was actually quite nice and relaxed. The service was efficient as well. It matters not to me that people who actually live in Ireland don't listen to Irish music; neither does it bother me that they don't do a fancy Irish jig when they knock back a few. I am one who enjoys such merriment, and will continue to do so. The $5.00 cover is just pennies to hear a live electric Irish band in the heart of Pike Place. Kells is a fine, fine place for a round or two. I too balked when all the un-locals started coming, and when those young fraternity fellows started a' callin as well, all a' tryin to dance that Irish jig like they knew what they was doin. But so what, it's a blast. Last time I was there, a short jolly man asked me to dance. i got a'stepin. I danced circles around him, literally, he held up his hand in the air, and I (the tall one) danced around him like and Irish showgirl. Is there such a thing? Well there was that night. Kells is THE Irish pub in Seattle. &#160;For some reason, the Guinness tastes better at Kells. &#160;They have great meat Pasties that have a nice buttery and light crust with tasty meat fillings. &#160;The Soda Bread! &#160;It haunts my dreams it's so good. &#160;I go to eat there on occasions just for the soda bread! &#160;All the regular things like Shepard's pie and hearty soups. &#160;Rory always has a nice pint waiting for me and makes it a point to try to cripple me whenever I stop by. &#160;As long as it's not too crowded it's a nice spot to have a few drinks and sometimes listen to the live band. &#160;Everybody loves to hear, "Rocky road to Dublin". &#160;Slinte! I come here primarily to have drinks with friends but did recently "oooo and ahhhh" over Kell's amazing Cobb salad. On this occasion, we were sitting outside enjoying the beautiful day along with other folks when I overheard the waitress/owner(?) tell two gentleman next to us that they'd have to move because the table they were at was reserved for diners; they just wanted drinks. &#160;I was mortified, and I wasn't even personally involved. Not only was I embarrassed for the gentlemen visitors to our fair city (obviously tourists), I was embarrassed for Kell's. "Move it to the back of the bus!" If this had been me, I would have left. &#160;There are no signs posted out back designating space as for "diners only." To avoid future embarrassment, I suggest the restaurant post some signs or seat guests according to what they plan to spend.I sat inside last fall to have drinks and watch a football game on Kell's big screen. Because we weren't eating, we had to fetch our own drinks from the bar. This may have made more sense had the place been busy, which it wasn't. It's been my observation that Kell's places a higher value on guests who come to spend serious money on a meal. It should be asking itself whether or not the experience is reason enough to return or recommend.Aug. 23 -- Returned to Kell's for after hours drinks. We set up a table outside and waited for a server to show. We finally went to the bar and learned that, once again, we had to fetch our own drinks. We may have stayed after having learned this had it not been for the group of preppies smoking on the back patio facing the alley. The staff seemed to turn a blind eye to it. It's apparently difficult for a waitress to confront his/her peer group when they're misbehaving. Not sure that the Cobb salad is enough to bring me back. I was completely blown away by how bad this place was after all of the great reviews I read. &#160;They only way someone could think of Kell's as a great Irish pub is if they have never left Seattle and never been to a real Irish pub. &#160;Let me help you avoid a poor pub night with the boys.The beer is great if you are one of those people who think that Guiness is the only Irish beer. &#160;Expect to pay top dollar for the same played out brands that you picked up at the local Safeway last week.The food is terrible. &#160;You will pay nine dollars for a hot pocket! &#160;(little hint when siphoning through the other reviews Pastie = over priced hot pocket) The portions on all of the food (not just the gourmet hot pockets) are tiny which may be for a good reason since everything I have tried has been terrible. &#160;If you like paying 20 dollars a plate so that you can feel like you are in Ireland eating a 4 dollar meal then dont let me stop you.And as a final note - the music will force you to gag on your overpriced guiness after about 30 minutes of the same stereotypical Irish folk music.Leave this place for the tourists who won't stray more than a block from the market. I agree that the Kell's in SF is way nicer, but Kell's here in Seatown is awesome. I can never say I have had the food, just came to enjoy a pint of Guiness or two or seven. That's what I love about Kell's for me. I have so many memories of sitting around singing "who the fuck is alice" til the wee hours, chatting with some dude with an Irish accent I couldn't understand, and one time see former Gov Lowery there. Hell yes, Kell's, hell yes. What can I say....a short walk up a flight of steps and I am halfway to an attitude adjustment and that right there justifies at least three of the stars. They pour a good shot, remember what I drink and never seem "slammed" even when the bar is packed. Everyone who works there is great no matter what day it is, however the crowds do change almost drastically depending on the night as noted by another reviewer. &#160;Generally I avoid Friday night. I may just love this because it is in Post Alley... and thus away from the madness of the fishmarket... Or perhaps its the irish people who work there, the beer selection, the perfect pour of Guinness, or the outdoor seating... hmmm. Well, its definitely not their specially brewed Kells' irish lager which makes Rogue brewery look like complete cowboys... Sorry, I digress... but can you beat a good Guinness in the sunshine? Nor can I... so four stars it is. Love that they have lots of seating! They make a mean buttery nipple - that my friend is highly recommended! What do you do after eating tons sushi and then some tasty tater tots/nachos? That's right you need to get yourself some Irish food and by Irish food I mean some Guinness!! And you ask where can you find a good crowd and some Guinness?? The answer is Kells Irish Pub because they offer some of the best stouts out there. Again the crowd there was young but not "pushy" and everyone there was easy to talk to. So I am not sure how we ended up there but I know I will for sure be back. Feels like some sort of corporate-owned mockery of an Irish pub. &#160;Tends to get pretty crowded on the weekends. &#160;Best hope is that you can find a seat outside on the alley which is nice during the summer. &#160;I'd suggest going across the alley to the Pink Door or next door to the White Horse. &#160;I like Fado better. On a recent business trip to Seattle, I was in desperate need of a good beer in a chill bar after too much work and little play. &#160;After walking for about 20 blocks and not finding any bars that lived up to my boss' liking (who invited HER?), finally we stumbled upon Kells. &#160;As an Irish alcoholic - I mean person, I knew that any Irish pub would be a friend of mine. &#160;Plus it's almost my namesake, can you really go wrong there (ok I'm only an 1/8 Irish but still)? &#160;However, I have been to some Irish pubs that were just bars serving good beer so I wanted to check it out. &#160;Success! &#160;Kells is truly an Irish pub. &#160;Ok so I haven't been to Ireland but I know deep in me bones that it is.My colleagues sat at a table near the entertaining live band, but I was feeling anti-social and bitchy so I sat at the bar to drown my sorrows in a pint or five and a shot of Patron to get the party started. &#160;They have a pretty decent beer selection, I tried the house brew which was enhh. &#160;But then I had a "Mac &amp; Jacks" and I was satisfied. &#160;The bartender was cute, young, friendly, and quick with the tap - just how I like 'em. &#160;The waitress was friendly, and so were the patrons who kept stopping by to order their beer. &#160;I even was invited to leave my pity party and join a local college student who was meeting her boyfriend's sister for the first time, and she offered to buy me a beer. &#160;Say what? &#160;That doesn' t happen in LA so I was shocked. &#160;The hard alcohol selection was bountiful which is always a bonus to the nice beer selection. &#160;The only food I consumed was my liquid dinner, but if it's as tasty as the male customers, then I give it a thumbs way up. &#160;But enough about the blonde Jake Gyllenhaal look-alike... &#160;Here's a summary of Kells:*Beer - tasty and a decent selection, but the house brew ain't that great*Service - friendly, quick, and not afraid to give you change in singles*Price - excellent, at $5 a pint I think that's a bargain (Patron shot was $10)*Bathroom - small and stinky, just like a true Irish pub, right? But there were three stalls for the ladies, always good to keep the line movin*Patrons - outstanding, friendly, good looking, and boisterous*Plus the taxis were plentiful and not shady.My only complaint was the random dog that was in the bar. &#160;I know I didn't drink THAT much and it was just weird... I mean I know how drunk people act, but drunk dogs?And yes, my boss finally left and I could booze it up in peace. &#160;Cheers to THAT! After popping around in the touristy market area, my friend took me up here. &#160;We happened upon it quite accidentally, though also intentionally...What I mean to say is that we took this staircase not knowing where it went to &amp; magically we arrived at exactly where we wanted to go.We sat outside admiring the view &amp; the cute little alley its in. &#160;As with every other place in Seattle, I ordered the house beer -- which was actually quite tasty. &#160;We also ate this fabulous brie dish with fruits &amp; bread. &#160;Who would have ever thought that melted brie would taste fabulous on watermelon? &#160;Definitely something you've gotta try - it totally hit the spot. For the bar side:My first impression was totally wrong. It's hard not to love a place full of people enjoying friends, meeting people, and dancing to live music. Get yourself some drinks, get 'em in you, and then enjoy the energy of letting loose with a bar full of people who've had a long week. It's a nice change from your too cool for school clubs of belltown and capitol hill where having too much might look just a little uncool
I think it's overpriced and not a good pizza and menu. Not hot enough. One of the worst pizzas in my life. Slow service too.
I love the pizza and the service; just called for a delivery and the fact that this company is smart enough to remember my information based on phone numbers is great. They know my address and have my credit card on file.Takes two minutes to order and it'll be here in 35 minutes. Exactly what you want when ordering pizza. Highly recommended.Didn't get five stars since a couple of times my order wasn't exactly right. I don't think Cap Hill Pagliacci is quite as good as some of the other Pagliacci's. &#160;But, it's still excellent. &#160;The salad is delicious. &#160;The pizza - cheese only and veggie topping pizzas are all delicious. &#160;As for the other yelpers complaints about the quality of ingredients - I could not disagree more. &#160;I know people who have worked at Pagliacci's who have told me that the cheese is an expensive import, many of the veggies are organic (including the leaf lettuce on the super tasty house salad), super fancy &amp; expensive peppers are used, etc.In addition to delicious food, another plus is Mac n Jack draft.One negative, &#160;I was disappointed to see that the pizza available by the slice looked like they had been sitting for a while - still tasted great, but probably would have tasted even better if they had been fresher. &#160;Pagliacci's is definitely the best pizza in Seattle. I like this place for straight up cheese pizza and that's it. &#160;I've tried toppings and they are not the best but the cheese is about perfect b/c they have good thin crispy crust. Also try the homemade Gelato-very, very good. I've been here twice so far and I must say that the pizza is...Not so great. I've had better pizza elsewhere. Anywhere else I mean. The decor is great and I enjoyed my 2 bud lights immensely, but that's it. The staff was friendly as hell, and even the bathrooms are gorgeous and spotless. Just one problem... Pizza wasn't worth shit. I wouldn't come here for the food, but if your looking for a nice spot to relax with a cold one and a semi-decent slice, here it is. This is my favorite place to get a slice of cheese pizza. And the pepperoni is awesome cold (not as good hot interestingly enough.)The pesto/pasta salad is really great as well.Probably my 2nd favorite pizza in town. (First of course, is Pizzutto's!) There was one day where I walked by this joint over and over again, trying to catch a glimpse of the "cute boy" (my friend's words) who worked inside. Then, we decided to eat there.The pizzas there are pretty good, and the salads decent. I got their pasta salad once, and it had a surprising amount of flavor. The quattro formaggio is the most enticing thing I've had with tomatoes *note - I HATE tomatoes - does this make me evil?* &#160;- I do try to hang back until I see a fresh pizza coming out of the oven. &#160;Food just sitting around kind of skeeves me.The pizza isn't stellar - I'd only give it maybe a 3 but the gelato.. OOOOOOHHHHHH the gelato - if I remember correctly it comes from the shop on 3rd and.. uh.. Pike or Pine.. maybe Union.. Geliatissimo hmmm.. I'd give it a 5 if I could remember the name.. I'm in love with the sweet cream and a combo of raspberry/lemon.. yum Perhaps you are on the Hill and need a place to grab lunch - cheep. fast. delicious. &#160;I've always had the most positive experiences here. &#160;The staff are cute, fun, and flirty. &#160;The options of pizzas are seemingly endless. &#160;And there are several nooks and crannies to hand with your posse.When you walk in you will have the choice of a salad (which I tend to forgo, even though they are good) and head straight for the pizza. &#160;Usually there are four to five choice - without fail these will include the staples of cheese and pepperoni with two-three other choices that are a bit more off kilter for us foodies. &#160;You tell the staff how many of which kind you want and they will send it down a cool conveyor-belt thing to make it warm and perfect for you.v When you pay you will get the option of gelato (highly recommended) or drinks (they sell beer/wine/soda/ice-tea and lemon aid).Great for eat-in or take out. Why is pizza in this town so overpriced? If you want to bend over and get a** raped, this is the place for you. This pizza is too overpriced IMO and there are better pizza places ( well not in Seattle that I have found) in the world lol,yet,if you have the hunger for a slice,its not that bad. Dont ever call them and tell them that your last pizza was burnt on the bottom should you order it. They will put a note on your name and then undercook your pizza the next time. Bloody hell! Ok, so my friend and I just went to Pag's on Broadway after hitting a few used bookstores on the Hill. You may want to try this place if you're in the neighborhood. I mean, it's cheap, so even if the food bites, you're not out that much cash. Plus, if you eat enough of it, you won't be hungry for a while. Like, I just had a slice, a root beer, and a salad and I'm still full. So when it comes to overcoming the pangs of hunger, Pagliacci's Broadway is a good choice.But if you're really looking for fine dining, I'd suggest The Herb Farm or Canlis or a place like that.
Pretty good Dim sum! &#160;Small and packed. Went yesterday on Chinese New Year for lunch with friends. Food came out quick and hot. Servers were always around and very attentive to fill water and tea. Only con was the wrap on the dumplings. It was a bit too thick for my liking yet fell apart when picking up the dumplings...But was pleased with the fast service and hot food. Checked out Harbor City this weekend and learned some things. &#160;First - don't go here at noon. WTF was I thinking?? &#160;Ended up waiting 45 minutes. &#160;Went over to Jade Garden during the wait and that place looked twice as bad. &#160;Does that mean it's twice as good? Hmmm...Anyways, back to Harbor City.Second - the prices are pretty decent. &#160;My friend and I ordered about 10 to 12 plates and the total was $31. &#160;Huge surprise as we were expecting a bill north of $40.Third - the food is pretty good, a little different from what I'm used to but good nonetheless. &#160;We ordered the gai-lan (Chinese broccoli) and it was a bit on the overcooked side so it was not as crisp as it should be. &#160;The fried taro had a curry filling which is unlike any other place I've ever been to. &#160;It wasn't bad but different. &#160;My friend thought the shu mai was a bit salty but being that he considers Chocolate Peanut Butter Tillamook Ice Cream a complete breakfast, I disregarded his opinion. &#160;Fourth - the staff was friendly and accommodating; two qualities not generally associated with dim sum places. &#160;We asked for water and they quickly &#160;brought water out. &#160;We ordered some items and they thanked us. &#160;I kinda felt like we were in Bizarro Superman world or something cause most other places have dim sum cart pushers that look pissed off at the world.In any case, I will definitely be back but it definitely won't be at the 12 o'clock hour. Dim sum for breakfast?! Yes please! I love that this place opens up early unlike the chinese restaurants on the Eastside. But I would recommend trying to get there before 10 or 11am on a Sunday morning. It gets pretty busy and the waiting area is not very big...The food was goooood. The shumai was nice, plump, and HOT. Not warm, but STEAMING. Good variety of little plates is always a plus as well. I wanted to try all of the buns...this time we only had the BBQ pork buns, but next time I'm going for the pineapple or the onion buns. The best part about this place is the price. Less than $20 (excl. tip) for 2 people and we were stuffed to the max. Quality food and great prices - I wouldn't mind driving across the lake just for this.My only gripe was the service....yes it was busy, but c'mon, let's push the carts a little faster. I'm definitely a fan of this place for dimsum and sometimes even dinner (probably only with my family, though!) Thanks to my Dad to introducing me to this restaurant. This restaurant is kind of small and compact so the noise level is crazy! It drives me up the wall sometimes because the tables are so close, you can't help but over hear what other tables are talking about! Also, sometimes the kids are uncontrollable. This isn't harbor city's fault.. it's just a super tight space.The dimsum is overall a pretty good deal and it always pretty hot/steaming! i love it. They always have a variety of dimsum so I'm able to choose what I like. My nemesis is egg tarts and they don't have very good egg tarts here (but no restaurants really have master the art of making egg tarts in seattle). The customer service is pretty good for a chinese restaurant. They are pretty friendly and aren't very pushy when it comes to the food. I rather eat here than Jade Garden.Also, the restaurant is fairly clean and sanitary. This is definitely my go-to restaurant for dimsum.They have a pretty good deal for dinner.. but I usually wouldn't eat here for dinner unless with my family. Hah. I think it's like you get 3 entrees and soup for under $30?? something like that. I wouldn't know. Only my Chinese Dad would know these deals. hah.Anyways, kudos to Harbor City. It doesn't look much from outside but never judge a book by its cover. This place is legit! :) Harbor City has become my favorite dim sum restaurant in Seattle. &#160;Thanks to fellow yelper Ron M. for introducing this place to me. &#160;I think the dim sum, customer service and cleanliness puts this place above the other restaurants that serve dim sum in the area. &#160;The dim sum staples - har gow, siu mai and char siu bao are really great here, particularly the siu mai. &#160;I appreciate that they offer water in addition to tea and keep your water glass filled. I also like that the servers make sure to roll their carts by all the tables. &#160;There is one dessert dim sum item that I'm glad to see is served here that I don't see served at other dim sum restaurants in Seattle - it is a sticky rice cake (circular in shape) with an egg custard filling. &#160;If you see it, you should try it. &#160;It's so good. This is a great spot for dim sum. Jade Garden (across the street) has been my usual spot for years, but as we all know the wait there is atrocious, regardless of day/time. Harbor City is a much smaller restaurant in comparison, and also very busy, but the wait is pretty short and nothing to worry about. They only have maybe 3 carts running around at any time, but everything is hot and constantly replenished. Prices are pretty decent, very comparable to other dim sum joints in the area. I've been here a couple times now, ordering all the usuals, and haven't been disappointed with anything. In fact, it's actually pretty damn good. Check it out if you haven't already. My experience with dim sum in Seattle has been up to now been mixed. It has all just been okay. But that is because I have not tried any of the top places like Jade Garden or Top Gun. My parents wanted to have dim sum today so we headed down to the I-District. I had my eyes set on Jade Garden but knew fully well that this may not be the best option since there are large crowds.We headed over around noon time to Jade Garden and encountered a crowd of people. Rather than wait, I guided them over to Harbor City instead which has been the host of a couple well received UYE events previously. The wait there was much more reasonable.From the outside, this place is a bit deceiving given the barbecue meat setup in the front window. But as it turns out I had the best dim sum in Seattle to date.The decor here is a bit dated in a retro sort of way. The focus here then is on the food. And they really delivered. Had numerous winning dishes here. Got the chive shrimp cakes, bean curd rolls, chicken feet, Chinese donut rice rolls, xiaolongbao and BBQ pork buns.Other than chicken feet which I don't eat, I have to say that I enjoyed all the dishes. For the record, the xiaolongbao are not the soup variety for those who care. Left feeling full and the bill was only $22 something plus tip for three people. Pretty cheap!For a good dim sum experience without a long wait, I suggest Harbor City. It's a simple family style Chinese restaurant with great good, large portions and great price. It's a very casual setting, been here a number of times for dim sum and dinner always see large tables fill up with family cerebration for birthdays, baby's full moon, club meetings.There serve dim sum for lunch and dinner and it's very good quality, except fewer selections less than Jade Garden but their prices are less as well. &#160;Overall I enjoy their food, service and I always have left over for the next day.p.s. after the meal try their asian desserts, it's tasty :) "Dim Sum Addicts Unite"Part of me wishes I'd never had dim sum before. The traditional Chinese brunch includes many delectables, but I doubt I'll ever have a more rapturous culinary experience than putting my face into a white, puffy barbecue pork bun for the first time. That bite was a one-time kind of revelation, and now I'm a dim sum addict for life.Luckily Seattle has a &#160;restaurant that will sate diners' dim sum desires the traditional way, on push carts - just like in Hong Kong and Chinatowns across the U.S. So although I'm no longer a dim sum virgin, I can live vicariously through you, dear Yelp readers, as you experience it for the first time at Harbor City.Dim sum isn't intimidating if you know what to expect. Here's what you need to know so you can worry about leaving room for dessert rather than trying to figure out what the heck is going on.Dim sum is a brunch synonymous with the Cantonese yum cha, or tea tasting. The meal, typically served in America on Saturdays and Sundays, originated as a light snack to accompany tea, so it's customary to order the hot beverage while dining.Think of dim sum as tapas on wheels: All sorts of small goodies are served on metal steamer carts and typically come in small servings of four. For that reason, it's best to try dim sum in groups of four, but the more the merrier.Don't expect to find Americanized standards like sweet and sour chicken. Dim sum offers dishes you can't normally find on a Chinese restaurant's menu, most of which are steamed or fried and include pork or shrimp.And while there are options like pig's blood cake and chicken feet, most of the food isn't scary in the least. It just may not be obvious exactly what you're eating.There's no menu, so you'll order by pointing at an enticing dish on the cart to let the server know you want it. If the dishes are covered, ask the server to lift the lid off each steamer. And you can always ask for an explanation if you can't figure out what you're looking at - just know that there's sometimes a language barrier.Dim sum is great for indecisive diners who have a hard time settling on one entree. Almost all the small plates are in the $2-$5 range, so you can order many of them and ignore a dish if it doesn't interest you.It's common to feel bombarded by the carts once you're seated, but you should resist the urge to order everything in sight.It's like conveyer-belt sushi. It's really easy to overdo it at the beginning.I suggest ordering three or four steamers at a time.That way you don't overload on food and everything will be fresh and nothing will get cold.If there's a plate you'd like to try but you haven't seen it, feel free to ask a server for it or track it down yourself.Sometimes when the carts are all over the place, you can absolutely go seek out the cart that you're looking for.If your chopstick skills aren't up to par like myself, don't hesitate to ask for a fork. No one will judge you.As you select plates off the carts, the servers will keep track of your bill on your table. When you're finished eating, you can take the card to the front counter to settle up. One final piece of advice: "Go early!" Dim sum novices and addicts alike flock Harbor City restaurant each weekend. If you like Jade Garden, this place will definitely satisfy your dim sum cravings, minus the long wait and hype. Harbor City serves fresh dim sum and their wait staff is nice (although a little pushy when you are ordering food, though typical). In addition to dim sum, you can also order fresh roasted pork, soy sauce chicken, or B.B.Q pork along with your brunch!I prefer Harbor City's dim sum over Jade Garden's because they regularly shuffle out the new supply when they run low rather than just make a whole batch right off the bat and let it sit there on the cart until someone orders it. A plus is that their chili sauce has a great kick! They have no problem splitting the check for people who carry plastic instead of cash. With fast service and good food, you'll be a fool to pass this place up! Dim Sum Done Right! Great selection of dim sum dishes and not greasy/oily like some places I've experienced. &#160;Be prepared for waiting a few minutes for a table on a Saturday morning...not too long though and worth the wait. &#160;Dim Sum for two came to a whopping total of $16.90 and we were stuffed. &#160;There are a lot of dim sum restaurants to choose from in the international district but it's nice to know that my search is over. &#160;Thanks Yelpers for steering me in the right direction. Hands down, the best dim sum in all of Seattle.Pork and Ginger shu mai, Beef meatball and shrimp-stuffed eggplant are just three of my favorites here. I don't usually like dim sum cause its usually too greasy. After reading all the reviews I had to check it out. I went with my little brother on a Thursday around noon. There was a little wait and then they tried to stick us at one of the small two people tables. Obviously not the most ideal for all the little dim sum plates. So the guy pulled up another small table. I thought was very nice. The food was very good and if we needed to order anything that wasn't coming around on the carts the lady who looked like she was in charge was happy to help us. Good service for a Chinese joint. A little overwhelming if you don't speak Chinese but I would recommend it! I'll make it simple and short:The BEST chinese restaurant in China town for me so far. Quality and quantity of their food is great, customer service is spot on. You can order dim sum until 11 PM, sweet! Price... darn - very affordable. Cleanliness... typical Chinese restaurant. I heard good things about Harbor City the first Yelp event I went to. Therefore, there's a urge for me to try. I made it today with a couple of my friends. Woohoo...! I was happy to know there's another option other than Jade Garden.There are a couple items that I must have when I go to dim sum places: 1) chicken feet and 2) beef meat balls. I was happy with both items in Harbor City, especially the beef meat balls. The meat balls were juicy and flavorful either with or without the black vinegar they put on. Normally, I can eat two orders of chicken feet just by myself. However, I was not able to do it because I was 90% stuffed by the time we got our chicken feet (apparently, it's popular). The chicken feet was tender and well-cooked, the meat/skin was right off the bones. Not to mention, it's not expensive at all! Three of us only paid $12 per person with 15% tips.Of course, you are in the International District, parking is never easy! We were fortunate enough to park about a block or two away! The wait time was about 15-20 mins. It wasn't too bad. It has a simple layout in Harbor City and it's very cozy, therefore, it's easier for the staff to take care of the customers. They have good services. I was a Dim Sum virgin before my visit to Harbor City on Thanksgiving. After reading the reviews I wasn't not surprised by this visit at all. There was plenty of food, service was fast, prices were low and customer service was absent!That's not to say this was a bad meal though. Carts rolled past with piles of food so high they almost toppled. There was plenty of fresh and yummy food to choose from and it never stopped rolling past the table. It was great! Don't try to place special orders more than once or twice though because a waiter won't come to your table to check in on you, serve you more water, or ask how the meal is. This is like a factory... come in, sit, eat, pay, LEAVE!I'll have to try some other spots in the ID to compare but I loved their potstickers and the walnut prawns. It seems like there's a lot of CA transplants in Seattle, and sorry about this guys, but now I'm here too. My Dim Sum palette is trained in San Gabriel Valley, which I often see others praise as the mecca of yum cha beyond Hong Kong. I think what I've been eating in SoCal is good -- but there's a lot more to my appreciation than just the food itself. It's an overall ambiance thing.I found Harbor City to be great, actually. The best part is how fresh the fare tastes. Even the best places in CA often tasted like it'd been in the steamer awhile, making rounds. Harbor City actually made us question the freshness of previous meals! The prices are fair, though a touch higher than I'm used to, and the little morsels are nearly overstuffed. Very nice. What makes me pine for SoCal dim sum is the scale of it all. The garishly lit, buzzing halls filled with 250 diners. Slurping, clanging, laughing on a mass scale. Carts and carts and a million smells. Each table a little exotic planet. Asking questions and making requests was often like traveling abroad -- most servers didn't speak English. It was a Sunday adventure. Here, at Harbor City, it's very toned down -- two carts idled lazily about before noon on Sunday. We'd seen all the variety served (from Yelp photos), but had a hard time finding variety on the cart -- maybe if we took our time, sat a bit longer? We asked after my favorite dessert Tofu Fa, but sadly, it isn't offered here. I don't want to complain, because I think Harbor City's fare is quite good. I'll be back, surely, but I'll be on the lookout for my familiar massive dining delirium too, elsewhere I guess. It'll be my absolute pleasure to come here with a big group and try more yumminess, and hopefully build my own noisy universe. I had only tried Jade Garden for my dim sum fix so after reading Yelp reviews, I decided to try Harbor City. Reading the reviews, I expected this place to be a lot bigger for some reason. No big deal since when I went in, it was fairly slow and my order was to-go anyways. I love that they have their dim sum throughout their day since Jade Garden only serve it until a certain time! Dim sum was good as expected and their duck that they have hanging is super good! You can get half-orders of it for well under $10 and it is a lot of it! The only thing keeping me from five-stars was service. It was pretty slow considering they weren't too busy and the guy at the front desk seemed frustrated when I asked him how long it would take for my order. All in all, definitely worth the trip! I would have never gone into this place if it wasn't for Yelp! Yay Yelp! :) I used to love this place but not so much anymore. The food is great but the service... If I order something that's almost ready, I expect to be the first to get it right when it comes out of the kitchen. I don't want to see the server trying to sell it to others when I specifically asked for it. And also when I order "made to order" rice rolls. I'm pretty sure it only takes under 5 minutes to make. Why did I wait 15 minutes and when I asked about it. The waitress simply said... Ohh I'm sorry. I forgot. So this is a place to go if you have plenty of time to kill since you'll be waiting forever and ever and ever for food. A solid collection of Dim Sum Good. Everything we ordered had an overall consistent taste. We went on around Noon on Sunday and it was a bit of a wait (30 minutes). Ended our meal with the egg custard sweet bun for dessert, yum!! Hint: Go there before 10:00am on Sunday if you want dim sum but do not want to wait and get shoved around before getting seated.We've gone there twice and both times were excellent. I'm from California and am use to devouring dim sum like no other, around LA and San Francisco. Harbor City is not that good but it's not bad. It's above average in all the best ways possible. If you know and love dim sum, you'll know what I mean when I say, "It'll give you your dim sum fix and leave you feeling satisfied (and stuffed)". Also a great sign of good food is that this restaurant is filled with Chinese families and locals. Enjoy! I have ate at a lot of dim sum places so I might be a little jaded on my review. &#160;To be honest, it is not the best dim sum I ever had and the price is okay. &#160;Due to the small restuarant size, the dim sum selection is very limited (about half of what I am use to). &#160;The quality of food is good and the taste is good as well. &#160;However, in comparison with dim sum in Oakland, LA, and New York, it falls a little flat in comparions. &#160;But overall it is still a good place to have dim sum. Everything tasted great, and the service was wonderful. Since the place is tiny, there were only 2 carts circulating, but whenever I waylaid a person down to ask for a specific dish, it came out within 2 minutes. Every dish was piping hot and delicious! I always judge dim sum by the quality of the cha siu baos, and these were really REALLY good. Didn't have to wait too long on a Saturday morning, either! Will definitely go back. Don't waste your time waiting at Jade Garden to eat there. Supposedly this chef used to work at Jade Garden. I think that everything is pretty good here. I usually really picky about my dim sum because I grew up in the bay area and we have GOOD dim sum. This place will give me my dim sum fix (my in betweens) until I savor dim sum in california or make my drive up to Richmond BC for some good dim sum.Things that I usually get are chicken feet, steamed shrimp dumpling, shu mai, leaf wrapped rice. You can't really go wrong at this place.I have also had dinner here which is pretty decent. They are mostly crowded for lunch time though. I am giving it four stars because I feel like restaurant experience should encompass service as well. Even though I'm Chinese and know to expect less than welcoming service, I always expect good food. DIM SUM reviewMy family and I got here at noon on a Sunday for the dim sum. Bunch of people waiting of course. Jade Garden is right across the street! My husband went to Jade's while I waited here to see who would get a table first. After 15 minutes we got a table at Harbor City. The hostess at Jade Garden was so busy. She couldn't give him a wait time. Harbor &#160;City is SMALL. It's discouraging for big parties. A lot of them came in and then left because their wait area is limited to about 10 of people. There's 2 chairs for seating.Dim sum wasn't bad but not as good as Jade Garden. I didn't like the sesame balls. It tasted weird. Pork ribs didn't really have flavor. Chinese broccoli came out cold. Steamed shrimp rice rolls were too mushy &amp; soggy. But the BBQ pork buns, sticky rice, siu mai &amp; baked BBQ pork bun were yummy. Prices are a little cheaper than Jade Garden. Harbor City Restaurant is a good alternative for Jade Garden. I went here twice with my girlfriend because we both are not morning people, and Jade Garden stops serving Dim Sum at 3 PM. The reason why I'm giving this a 3 stars because every time I take some of the left over &#160;like hai gow (shrimp dumpling) to-go, the skin would become really dry within a few hours. I never had this problem with Jade Garden to-go. Other than that, the price is reasonable, and the foods are relatively good. Some say Harbor City has the best dim sum in Seattle. &#160;I don't know. &#160;If I like the food, I like the food. &#160;If I don't, then I don't. &#160;I don't really do "this is better than that" kind of thing.That said, this place does have the most tender turnip cake (which is important to me). &#160;Phoenix claw is pretty good -- very similar to some other dim sum places in the area.I'll definitely make this my "home" dim sum place. &#160;You can order an entire roasted duck too. &#160;Duck to-go is around 17 bucks. &#160;If eating in, the duck is slightly more expensive.The place is pretty small -- so make sure you don't go during busy lunch rush-hour. Good place for dim sum. Seattle as a whole is horrible for Chinese food, as we all can attest the frequent need to head up to the wonderful paradise that is Vancouver, Canada. However, if you MUST have your fix of plausable and actually tasty dim sum, this IS the place. It is ala-carte, so don't expect the carts. But that could be a good thing as your food is cooked to order and the serving size is quite large. Be sure to try their Shrimp Dumplings (har gao/Xia Jiao) and there are 3 different types and we also liked their beef balls and Hum Bao (bun). Pass on the Sui Mai, too porky.. .. Also, do get their Water Spinach to round out your meal, healthily.Its only too bad the place closes at 10pm, as this IS the only place here that is anything close to good. Before, I had rated it 3, but would now give it a solid 4. The dim sum here is just as good if not better than Jade Garden. I used to like Jade Garden but got sick of their service and the long lines. to eat and to pay! I wish I heard about Harbor City a long time ago!I don't know if I should be mentioning the place, as it does get busy there during lunch hour. It's right accross the street from JG. I just think Harbor City deserves a mention. You can find all your usual favorites here and it's still fresh.Also want to mention the cleanliness factor. Though both are a bit rundown, Harbor City is a way cleaner. Harbor City is my favorite dim sum restaurant to go to. On street parking is available, early of course. It's best you get there before 10:30am. Wait is no more than 10-15minutes max. Food in steam and fried carts come out of the kitchen hot &amp; fresh. Wait staff are fast &amp; attentive. The place is clean and decor kept to a minimum. Price wise, you get your moneys worth. We paid $20 for 7-8, small-med dishes. If you're looking for a little more formality, you're better off going to O'Asian. If you go twice in one week, either you have a problem or the place has really hit the mark. Both might be true in the case of this dim sum place in the International District.I went with co-workers for lunch, mid-week and went back for Sunday dim sum w/ family and both times, ahhhh, let me tell you what:the steamed buns, the vegetable dishes, the shrimp-everythings, the noodle dishes, soups, oh wow.If you are the type of person who needs/wants to know all the ingredients in a dish, then dodge this bullet (unless you speak and read chinese) - because I did not see one word of english print on the menus, the daily fresh list or anywhere else.When you go, because you must go, expect a short wait (most likely )- although the sign said this place is open til 2 am on weekend evenings- which means I think I have just found my new fav late night food spot in the whole city... and I have no idea what the crowds are like then. Once you've been seated expect fast, frequent and fresh carts of dim sum. Don't be shy and pick up some dishes that are old favorites and some that are mysterious. You will NOT be disappointed. Huge bonus: four of us (big and hungry eaters) consumed more than our fill last Sunday and spent a whoping total of $45. Yes. That's right.Just imagine what polite company eats- if you're on a budget, this would be a GREAT date spot (as long as your date is into good food and not limited in their tastes..)Go for it. My husband and I went to Seattle during Thanksgiving holiday for a mini-vacation. &#160;After walking nearly two miles along the pier from our hotel and nothing was open for us to eat, we finally called a cab to take us to Chinatown, &#160;The cab drop us off in front of Harbor City and we're glad that they're open for dim sum. &#160;There was a short wait when we got there, but the large variety of dim sum made up for it. &#160;The dim sum was decent and the their jasmine tea is very good. &#160;Thank you for saving us from starvation! Got into this restaurant about 2 pm. It was pretty quiet for the most part, only 3 tables were in use. I was greeted as I walk into the door and led to a side table. The water and tea was quickly brought out, and the dim sum soon roll on by. The selection they actually had on the cart was limited to 7 items, although the back of their menu listed a lot more items. I ask for the chicken feet, and tripes and they told me they didn't have it. Overall, my experience wasn't spectacular. Just another seattle dim sum place. I couldn't actually taste any big difference between the dim sum serve here, compare to the one at jade garden or the dim sums 2 blocks down and the one up the street. They all tasted pretty much alike. Prices were competitive, and service was really good. I go here when I want the best dim sum in town served to me piping hot! Everything I've had here has been flawless. It's not a big restaurant, and given that it is a dim sum place in the ID it can get crazy chaotic in the front, but that's just part of the charm. Come here on the weekdays if you're claustrophobic. That said, the hostess is always alert and fair when it comes to seating people, which makes it a lot less stressful. Basically this place is always consistent across the board and has a lot of charm! Got to love the two identical Picasso prints on the back wall! First off, I'd like to thank my fellow Yelpers for such persuasive reviews on Harbor City!On the way to meeting my friend, I yelped Dim Sum and saw all the positive reviews for this place. &#160;Instead of going to Jade Garden, my friend and I decided to try Harbor City and we had a great first experience. &#160;I enjoyed seeing the Duck in the window and they also sell Char Siu (BBQ Pork) for very cheap. &#160;We waited for maybe 12ish minutes and was quickly welcomed with carts full of delicious-smelling dim sum. &#160;We ordered our usual: broccoli, sticky rice, steamed shrimp, pan-fried shrimp cakes with green onions, steamed pork and we also tried a sweet bun with green onions. &#160; We both agreed that the sticky rice was better here (than Jade), but we weren't sold on the steamed shrimp balls. &#160;We did enjoy the pan-fried shrimp cakes better here as well and we both liked the sweet buns. &#160;It took the waitress a very long time to bring us water, but overall, everything was tasty, cheap and quick. Great service! Friendly and quick, came here for menu service which is prepared well and seasoned just right. Came also for dim sum and well I can't wait to come back for more :) the BBQ pork bun was freakin amazing for dim sum, also remembered liking the cilantro shrimp one alot as well. Too many to name just meet me there YO!
Eat breakfast here.This restaurant has one of the best breakfasts in Seattle. (I've tried most of them.) They have the Chow Foods style rotating menu so there's always something new to try (or at least once a quarter.)Order something with the hash browns and you won't go home crying.Don't miss the coffee cake of the day - you can sub out your dry wheat toast for an extra dollar.I wouldn't bother going there for dinner. Only breakfast. Say it. I am a die-hard Chow Foods fan. Chow owns Coastal Kitchen, Mio Posto, the Five Spot, Hi-Life (in Mysterious Ballard) and Endolyne Joe's. Plus Atlas Foods in the U Village, but I rarely go to U Village due to the high number of squalling brats and the low number of available parking spots. I love Endolyne Joe's probably the most of any Chow restaurant. The food is uniformly good, the service is always expert, and if something is wrong they will bend over backwards to make it right. Case in point: my partner and I each had a hot fudge sundae one night, which came with what was supposed to be an edible toffee garnish. However, the toffee was miserably chewy - the kind of chewy that feels like your fillings are being pulled out. We brought this to the attention of our waitperson, citing a similar experience with the same sundae a few weeks before. Our waitress said, "I'll tell the chef... maybe she will do something about it." Sure enough, the next time we were there they had completely changed the garnish on the hot fudge sundae. Our waitress (same perky woman as before) remembered us and shared how after we'd left the chef took a bite of the offending toffee and said, 'This is awful! This has gotta go!' But I digress.Like Coastal Kitchen, Endolyne Joe's rotates different menus featuring different areas of the country. One menu featured food from Hawaii. The corn/coconut/pineapple muffins they had on that menu were a true gustatorial wonder. Other wonders: the calamari/cabbage slaw. Unbelievably tasty! Fried chicken: probably the best in the city. Whenever at any Chow restaurant - be it Coastal Kitchen, Hi-Life, Five Spot - order the pork chop. Chow understands pork. They know their way around a pork chop. I have never had a bad pork chop at any Chow eatery.Like Coastal Kitchen, the prices at Endolyne Joe's are above the average diner price range. But it is well worth it. The atmosphere, the food, the service is well-worth the long haul over the West Seattle Bridge.Also: Chow restaurants know their breakfasts. Endolyne Joe's is no exception. Their oats are exceptional. Plus it's fun to order oatmeal and have your waitperson lean back and bellow 'OATS!!!' and have the kitchen bellow back 'OATS!!!' Their coffee cakes are (almost) always worth the calories. The ham they serve is from Neiman Farms: very tasty ham. None of this oval 'ham steak' here, but an honest-to-goodness chunk of ham. Their corned beef hash is home-made. Not just assembled in the restaurant: they corn the actual beef there on the premises. Even their scrambled egg whites are delicious. My one and only complaint: when I ask for fruit instead of hash browns, I get only what should be considered a garnish. Five grapes, perhaps, and a sliver of grapefruit. But, I quibble. Everything else is top-notch. The menu is pretty diverse since they change their theme about every three months. &#160;It is my favorite out of all the Chow Foods. &#160; It is very spacious and comfortable. &#160;The service varies and is not always pleasant. &#160;They have an excellent brunch menu too. New post:Again, I am editing...I want to Joe's tonight for din-din. The region is Kentucky. Foods sampled:Fried Green Tomatoes: Tangy sauce, Cajun breading...pretty good.The ham dish: The ham was tough, the sauce good.The chicken fried steak: my favorite of the night, served with mashers and greens, if I recall.The catfish: moms had it, and she did not complain, but I don't touch the stuff, so don't ask.My dad had the fried chicken, which I believe is a regular menu item, and it was good, too.Great fresh squeezed (I think) lemonade.Amusing moment: Someone was celebrating a birthday a table or so behind us, and they (we) were treated to a little serenade from a trio of employees - host and two servers. Unfortunately, one of the balladeers looked like she could not wait to blow out the candle call it a night. Happy birthday indeed.Original post:Like the rest of you Yelpers, I love the Breakfast here. Daggone great. The service though? &#160;A funny mix. I have had good. I have had bad. There is a funny little host like fellow, balding, if I recall, and he always seems eager to please. Now, if only the rest of the staff could follow suit. Nice open style seating, food list changes every 3 months. Food good, wervice bad. Some outdoor seating. Pleace has lots of folks going for dinner.
When I went to the University of Washington, I would come here if I had extra time to walk from campus (it's like 4 or 5 blocks away), was really hungry, and only had cash with me. To start, the food here is really tasty and addicting. My favorite dish is the mochiko (spelling) chicken. I dunno what it is about this dish, but the breading tastes so yummy. It's basically a deep fried chicken with this seasoned breading. If you're looking for more to eat, try a combo plate. I recommend the Theta Chi place which has the mochiko chicken, spicy chicken, fried rice, and egg. Or, the Hawaiian plate which is the mochiko chicken, chicken katsu, fried rice, and egg. SO GOOD!! (I must admit though, it's not going to be healthy, but whatever!)The reason why this place is not a five star is because of 2 things. One, they don't accept credit or debit cards! We are in the 21st century, and I understand that they are losing 25 cents per transaction, but there are plenty of times where I chose to eat elsewhere simply because I had no cash on me! The second reason is because the space is kind of dirty. But all that aside, the food is great and I would come here again (if I had cash lol) I'm going to be straight with Yelpers. This place is great!But only if you have CASH ONLY. The reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is totally because of its location (if you're a UW student)....too damn far up the Ave and also because it DOES NOT ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS!I'm all like, what if you gotta eat a lot but don't got no cash?! These days nobody carries cash with them all the time, unless you could be dealing in some shady businesses.....People be plastic all the time and to me it just doesn't make any sense for them to still accept cash only....correct me if I'm wrong but cash soooo not convenient~! I think they have also been around for quite a while, so if they haven't transitioned out of cash only there's a reason why they haven't other than for money reasons...I would've given this place 3 stars but because the food here is so damn delectable and so fresh and the MOCHIKO CHICKEN is bomb, I must to give this place 4 stars! BOTTOM LINE: Come here if you have a lot of time or can take a bus here and if you have cash for some of the most best food that is BIG in portions and will fill you up guaranteed~! Wow I can't believe I did not write a review on this place yet! I used to frequently dine here during my college years after study groups or club meetings. The owners of the place always remember familiar faces and have no shame playfully joking with you and others in the restaurant. I am a big kalua pork fanatic and they do serve decent kalua pork here. It's not the best but it does hit the spot. This is the only dish I can finish from here in one sitting. The rest of the meals I have ordered here are big enough to save half for another meal. I like their mochiko chicken and chicken katsu if I'm not in the mood for pork. If I'm in an indecisive mood, I order the alpha sig place since it has chicken katsu, spicy chicken, and fried rice with an egg on top. Come to think of it, it has been awhile since I dined here. Time to make a much needed visit! We went here for lunch last Friday, and shared a chicken hambow, and one of their combination plates. We liked it a lot and will be going back.The two types of chicken on the plate were good, but believe it or not, the fried rice and egg on top were superstar great. The hambow was enormous, and delicious, especially for $2.39. You could easily just eat that for lunch.I wasnt brave enough to ask if they had a restroom... I wasnt encouraged by the apparent lack of maintenance in the dining room. The kitchen area looked clean enough, but then again I'm somewhat cavalier about eating out.Essentially, go here for the food, and hope for the best with the rest of the experience. It is what it is!Hawaiian food. They offer lots of different combos and many are named after frats at UW. It's mainly meat and rice. They've got spam, loco moco, chicken, etc. Big portions, tasty, greasy, heavy food. A favorite among college students, lots of food for cheap prices. Good if that's what you're looking for, but I can only come here once in a while b/c I don't like feeling so full and weighed down after eating here. Price is very low, portions are very large. &#160;How can you not be satisfied with a decent tasting $7 plate that serves 2 people?They do serve some Hawaiian style stuff, BUT I would not call the food Hawaiian though, I mean they dont serve much Hawaiian food (no poi?, 1 spam dish, no teri burger, no lomi salmon, stew?, dried aku, no lau lau, etc...) &#160;and second, its not even BBQ. This is what is called "Drive-in mix plate" and thats Hawaiian enough. &#160;Exactly like Rainbows by Waikiki.ALSO, NO MSG HERE! Firstly, bring cash. They don't accept cards at all, or checks i believe. They DID add an atm finally, but if that one's out of service the next one is 3 blocks away.Now, to review the food. The food is super cheap, which is awesome, thumbs up. You get a lot of it. Another thumbs up there, but now I've ran out of thumbs. The food isn't out of this world amazing but for the price I really can't complain that much.I do come here pretty often, so i'm not turned off by it, I just wish there were more island stuff I'm used to...you know..lomi lomi salmon, poi (hard to find anymore, &#160;I know), poke.  Parking can be somewhat cumbersome and if it's busy expect a good wait, there's only a couple cooks, so going there during lunch rush isn't always the best idea if you are on a tight schedule.All and all though.It's a good, cheap place for pretty good hawaiian food. Had to drive from Redmond one night to get my "plate lunch" fix. &#160;Portions were huge, even for a big appetite like mine. &#160;My family ordered a mixed variety of combos and they were all pretty good. &#160;Katsu and shortribs stood out. &#160;The fried egg added texture and flavor to the rice.Prices were relatively cheap, considering that I brought home enough leftovers for dinner the next evening.Don't count calories or carbs here. It's all about filling and satisfying good ol' island food.Only thing keeping me from giving a 5 is the cleanliness. &#160;Could use some extra wiping and moping in there. &#160;Also remember to bring cash. I have ordered the #20 from here more often than I have fingers and toes. You cannot get better value than here.Chicken + Katsu + Short Rib = SatisfactionCompliments to Mr. Chen for feeding me throughout my stay at the U.
Great comfort food, it's cheap but tasty!Chan is one of the kindest people I've ever met in the restaurant business. I came in today for some food but he recently changed to cash only. I was short a dollar some but he said it was okay and to just pay him back next time. Such trust is amazing.Besides Chan being a great guy the food he makes is always amazing and really hits the spot when you're hungry. They have a ton of different combination of plates that are displayed on the wall. &#160;You won't find a plate that is over 10 dollars, also he hasn't raised any of the prices of his food since I've started eating here. The ultimate bang for you buck. &#160;The portions are huge and delicious! &#160;My usual order is the Alpha Sig, it has chicken katsu, spicy chicken, and fried rice with an egg on top. &#160;Very down to earth, great food, large quantity, and Chan is absolutely superb. Bring cash, he does not accept credit cards anymore! Unless you're allergic to everything edible or hate food or are really picky or just not a real person, eat here. That's all. It's priceless. Scrumptious. Indescribable. Mouth orgasm. Yeah, it's greasy, you'll probably gain 20 pounds if you eat here everyday but WHATEVER. Mr. Chan is awesome and so is the overly rice-stuffed spam musubi. I go here on the regular and I still have to spend 10 minutes staring at the menu aka wall of pictures.But really though, everyone I've taken here has been so hyped on it. And seriously, one standard combo is enough food for at least three meals, for under $10. I'm a college student. I like lots of food for extremely cheap prices. But I also like how it tastes, ya digg?Hawaii BBQ provides all that I need. Prices range in the 5-7 dollar range and they provide you a heaping plate of fried rice and whatever goodies you want. Perfect. I used to live in Seattle and I would try to eat here at least once a month. &#160;The Chicken Katsu is amazing. &#160;Also, the Spam musubi is great.Every time I go back to visit Seattle I try to make sure to bring whoever I am with to my favorite lunch place in the University District. I love going here when I'm extra hungry because their portions are HUGE. &#160;I always have pretty much half a box of leftovers when i'm finished.I love that fact that most of the combo plates have fried rice included in it instead of white rice like other places, the wait is a bit longer than most, but good things come to those who wait!The man behind the counter that's always there is really nice and usually makes a joke here or there.The bad thing I found out last time I went in was that they no longer accept debit/credit cards, so remember to bring enough cash! Though they do have an ATM machine inside the restaurant which is pretty nice, only if you want to pay like a $3-5 surcharge fee though. &#160;Also, the fried egg that is usually on top of the fried rice is kind of runny sometimes. Might be good to tell him to cook it longer if you don't like that, I always forget to ask though. Good food but not a very clean place. Hawaii BBQ is one of the few mainstays on the Ave. The businesses in the area change as much as the student body at UW does. But this place is one of the constants. And it is easy to see why. Hawaiian plate lunch fare is known for having large portions, being hearty and a good value. This is a good match for the neighborhood as it appeals to the budget-conscious student along and the ex-kamaaina looking for grinds from home.As Hawaiian places go, Hawaii BBQ easily has the best pricing around town. You will not find a place with a bigger bang for your buck. And the portions are not small. They are gigantic, almost to the point of being too much food to eat in one sitting. That is unless you are a football player, sumo wrestler or the like.The menu here is presented through photos of the plates offered with wording in small print. A little hard to navigate because it does not seem like the plates follow a numeric order. Pricing for lunch plates can vary from $5 something to $13 for the Hawaiian plate, laulau fixings and all.On my latest trip, I got the Hawaiian club plate ($6.95) which consists of fried rice with egg, mochiko chicken and chicken katsu with dipping sauce on the side. It was the afternoon and I had not eaten the whole day. Lucky I didn't. The portions were so big that I skipped having a regular dinner.While the plate is massive, the food was just okay. The fried rice was a bit ordinary. I wished it had some Portuguese sausage or kim chee instead of just the basic peas and carrots. The mochiko chicken was decent, though it was mostly breading that filled up this part of the plate. I will say that the chicken katsu here is excellent. Just the right amount of crispiness and the sauce that compliments it works well.The place is no frills and packed mostly with students and ex-Hawaii locals. A pretty popular takeout place too. Also the restaurant is cash only, which probably is so they can keep costs down. They have an ATM for your convenience in the store if you need it.If you are looking for some ono kine grindz or just some cheap eats, Hawaii BBQ is da kine of place for you! DEALS! deals for days. come here if you are POOR. First things first, this place definitely does not accept cards as the Yelp details suggest, and is most definitely cash-only. &#160;There is an ATM machine right in the restaurant if you don't mind price gauging, however, I'd suggest just coming prepared. &#160;Kinda makes you wonder, if they can afford an ATM machine, why not just put in a credit card machine at the register, but I digress.My visit today was my second attempt to try this place out as it was closed the last time I swung by, so I went and got cash and came back. &#160;The atmosphere of the place leaves a lot to be desired as it's kind of grimy, everything seems old and faded, and the bathroom reeks. &#160;The only positive is a wall full of pictures of their food numbered and explained, it was a fun way to order. &#160;As I sat down to wait for my food, I was sure this place was headed for one of my rare 1-2 star reviews, but then...They surprised me with the quality of their food. &#160;I can't give less than three stars to any restaurant that has good food unless the service is completely abysmal, so this place made it to three stars with room for growth. &#160;My wife and I ordered: #15 Theta Chi Plate (which came with: &#160;Muchiko Chicken, Spicy Chicken, Hawaiian Fried Rice, and an Egg) , #24 Meat Jun, two Spam Musibis, and a couple cans of guava nectar and it all came to less than $25. &#160;Price-wise, this place fills you up for cheap.The Theta Chi Plate was the highlight of the meal, and the Muchiko Chicken was the highlight of that. &#160;It was crispy but with an airy texture to it. &#160;The flavor was hard to pin down but it was amazing and it alone bumped the review of this place up and made me willing to return in the future. &#160;I'm sure I'll have to go back because my wife, a connoisseur of all things crispy, was heard to say: "this place alone makes me glad I'm starting school here," "I could see myself craving this every week," &amp; my personal favorite: "I'd divorce you and get married again so we could serve this at our wedding." &#160;High praise from a crunch-fiend. &#160;All the other components were slightly less interesting but still tasted good, the Spam in the fried rice was especially good.I was less enthusiastic about my Meat Jun, which I ordered based on reviews on Yelp. &#160;Meat Jun seems to have its origins in Korean cooking, and was supposed to be marinated in a sweet/salty shoyu, dipped in egg, then fried. &#160;Sounds tasty right? &#160;Not so much. &#160;The meat wasn't tender at all, it was really chewy and grisly. &#160;It was served with plain white rice and left me wishing I'd broken the cardinal rule of eating out as a couple and just ordered what she had.Finally, the Spam Musubi came out hot, the first time I've had one warm, and if you like Spam Musubi, you'll like this one.I'll go back for the Muchiko Chicken and because it was cheap, but might just order takeout next time. This isn't just another place to eat; Hawaii BBQ has established itself as a quintessential part of U-district culture. &#160;My favorite is the Hawaiian Club: &#160;Hawaiian fried rice (with fried egg on top, of course!), muchiko chicken and katsu chicken.I personally have Hawaii BBQ on speed dial. Fast service, ONO grinds!!!!!!!!I've been eating here since (I think) 2000? Maybe a year before that... At any rate, the grinds are super good! &#160;Portions are good. &#160;Come if you're hungry! &#160;The service, well, it's order, pay and pick it up at the counter, eat and either leave your dishes at the table or dump them in the dirty dishes bin. &#160;Whatever... no biggie for me. &#160;Good prices, good menus, good taste. &#160;Try it... you'll love it! You know it's good when Husky football, basketball, cheerleaders, and other athletes come here to eat. Massive proportions for a good price AND it tastes great! There are posters of both Hawaii and UW sports on the walls and different fraternities have claimed dishes to their name.Great place to go on a college budget. The Katsudon bowl is a personal favorite. The only downside now is that's it is cash only (which is recent). They also have Hawaiian sun in stock, which is a plus! I have stringent criteria when trying out new restaurants. When I try out new pizza places, I get cheese pizza, because its the lowest common denominator of food, it tastes good and every pizza place has it. So, for those same reasons, when I try places that serve Asian food, when possible, I get the chicken katsu. I don't think this is a groundbreaking new practice - I'm sure others do this as well - but I just wanna let you know where I'm coming from. It's the scientific method, in food form, and this review is one of my published findings. I'm like Indiana Jones.Hawaii BBQ's chicken katsu is what I consider the barometer for the complete chicken katsu experience. It is delicious and made-to-order. The portions are very generous - to be sure, they have lovingly slaughtered at least half of a chicken to make that katsu cutlet. Sure, the restaurant is kind of a hole-in-the-wall, and sure, I feel like I'm going to get E. coli just from looking at the place, but I think it's important to temper those feelings with the thought &#160;that katsu this good and of these proportions would probably cost you $3-$5 more somewhere else. It's an amazing value!I can't speak to the rest of the menu. I only ever order the katsu when I go, but I can assure you I know what I'm talking about with regards to the katsu - I've ordered it many times. I would assume that the experience is very similar if you order something else.My tummy and wallet give this place 5 stars. My brief stint living in the U was made much happier by the proximity of Hawaii BBQ. I used to get off work, pick up some Kalua pork or muchiko chicken or tonkatsu, and then cram my face while hiding from my roommates in my room. We can all agree that hiding from your roommates is somewhat unpleasant. But hiding in your room with some food from the BBQ? Pretty damn good.I hadn't been back since then, until my brother and I accidentally got very drunk and decided we NEEDED Hawaiian food. Needed it. So we swung by on our way back from Rat &amp; Raven, drooling in anticipation. He picked up a katsu/muchiko combo, I got the spicy pork, and we rolled on down to his place to write some metal songs for our new joke band while we ate. The songs? Yeah, they didn't get written until after we were done eating. I was simply too distracted by all the nomability going on in my takeout box (I oopsed and ate too much). Cheap, delicious Hawaiian foods! You WILL have left-overs, so your $6 will go far. Bring cash. Also, there is no restroom here, so normally I get it to go, and stop next door for some Bubble tea and head home or to the park to eat. :) Don't be scared to try this place because of how the place looks. Yes it is old and look not so clean and nice but their food is very good haha I'm big fan of spam and fried eggs and thats best part of hawaiian food! try their masubi ( rice ball with spam and wrapped with seaweed ) !! Chan makes the best Katsu in Seattle. You cant eat here but more than once or twice a month tho, or your heart might double palpatating more than it wants to :) Comfort food and im about to knock out after this meal food are definitely found here tho! Chan is funny too. He plays the same Hawaiian music all the time. Sometimes you got to get a new cd Chan! Its good tho, this spot is great and the Donkatsu, mix plates and just about all of it is good stuff. If you ever went to UW or lived int he U-District, you know that Hawaii BBQ is the place to get some good food for cheap. And the kalbi ribs are about as good as you will get at a Hawaii BBQ/Teriyaki spot. Only other close would be at a Korean BBQ spot (Secret Garden in Lynnwood), but not at such a cheap price!Go by there now and order the Katsu/shortrib combo with mac salad. and then go to the house, lay down on the couch and clear the schedule. You want good food, you want it cooked fresh, and you want it cooked good, you want here. YUMMY. It doesn't take very much time, after taking your first bite, to want to come back. &#160;I have been coming here for years, until today, it's been a short while, but walking in; it felt like home. &#160;Helped that the person standing inside was the beautiful person I have been missing for a while. &#160;Look, they are going to give you Hawaiian food, the type you find at the local hole in the walk place, and they give you enough that you will be full. &#160;It's also at a very reasonable price, below 10 dollars a person. &#160;It's fried goodness; you get a great cooked eggs, rice, and perfectly battered chicken; and that's just the katsu plates. &#160;Oh yeah, you have to know that there will be wait if it's busy. &#160;Why you ask? &#160;Because they cook everything when ordered; fast food, cooked right. What about the classic spam musubi, um.. it's WIN. &#160;Their rice bowls, "-don" &#160;are serious meals, you will always get a value here, and with 2 hour street parking all over, it's easy to park and eat. &#160;I can't say this enough, you want a good meal, and this place is perfect for all eaters. From the outside I must say this place looks like an absolute dump. &#160;Even after going in and looking at the menu (which is just a bunch printed pictures on the wall) it still doesn't give that feeling of a great restaurant. &#160;But once you taste the food all of that goes away!! &#160;The food here is absolutely delicious and at a great price. &#160;I usually get the Loco Moco, which comes with 2 patties and their gravy sauce that is to die for. &#160;I also just love their Mochiko Chicken. &#160;The breading and dipping sauce are amazin!! &#160;If you are in the U District and looking for a place to check out this is a winner for sure! 10 years and running since I've been going here. &#160;My first visit was when I was in college and living only a couple blocks away. &#160;Now I live about 7 minutes away by car (yes, i've done it a few times), but I make the drive at least twice a week. &#160;The food is inexpensive and the portions are huge. &#160;They have a ridiculous amount of menu choices (+65) with pictures of each dish by them. &#160;If you want delicious, inexpensive hawaiian/teriyaki food, this is the best place on the Ave. &#160;The owner recognizes his patrons too. &#160;Once you've been there a few times, you'll notice your portion size growing to extremely fatty-status and free mac salad being thrown in. You have got to go here!!!!!!! &#160;Small hole in the wall but fantastic food, especially the Loco Moco. &#160;Its better than you can get on the Islands. &#160;The menu is on the wall using color pictures and a brief description of each item. &#160;You order by item number but I love that the pictures are random and dont go numerically. &#160;It forces you to look at nearly all of the choices.Mr. Chan is a kick and its hard to believe that these prices are so low for the huge amounts of quality food on each plate. &#160;My buddy and I who are big eaters couldnt finish the Loco Moco!!!GO TO THIS PLACE AND YOU WILL RETURN MANY TIMES!!!Roady Whenever I need my Local Ono Grinds fix, I head to Hawaii BBQ in the U-District. &#160;Uncle Chang (although now I'm wondering if his name is actually "Chan" since that's what everyone else is saying) &#160;is the owner of this 'hole-in-the-wall' and cooks delicious plate lunches for a very cheap price with of course, HUGE portions. &#160;More things to love: selling of Hawaiian Sun juice, musubis and manapuas; outdated pictures of Hawaii, the Warriors, the Warriors Cheerleaders; two pictures promoting Hawaiian Airlines which so coincidentally I had hung up in my house growing up in Hawaii; watching people walk in and the door swinging against the wall and running into kids that I knew from High school. &#160;:)Although I am a frequent visitor to Uncle Chang, he continues to call me Kristen. &#160;GREAT place to go! Holy crap! I am so full, and I only ate half of the Loco Moco. The portions are super generous. I could feel my arteries screaming in protest with every bite, yet I had to have more! I got take-out, and my cat watched on intently. He was convince that I was eating HIS food and wasn't afraid to tell me so.The establishment itself is nothing to write home about, just a little hole-in-the-wall that focuses on what counts - great food! I called in my order and the guy was super distracted that he didn't take my name for the order (I found out he was also running the grill). When I got there and told him I had called in, he at first tried to give me someone else's order.Considering what a huge selection they have, and no website to-date, I highly recommend coming in-person to order. I am looking forward to trying out some other tasty dishes in the future! :) This place has one dish I can't do without... that's their meat jun. &#160;It's a Korean Hawaiian-y dish that's meat dipped in an eggy mixture which is SO FRICKIN GOOD. &#160;I really like this dish and it's not that easy to find in Seattle. &#160;Their kalua pig was so-so but I really just come back for the meat jun. &#160;The two Chinese dudes who own the place are nice but quiet. &#160;This place looks kinda like a hole-in-the-wall so you've got to find the dish that gives you a good reason to come inside. This place has been around seemingly forever and little has changed. &#160;I hope it always endures that way. &#160;Hawaiian food that's pretty great, portioned for Islander appetites, and priced for college students. &#160;What more could you ask for?! &#160;The picture menu on the wall has not changed much since I was hanging around the Ave. as a student at UW. &#160;The choices are plentiful and the staff has always been friendly. &#160;I'm surprised I didn't review this place before because I still recommend it to friends! &#160;Don't forget that it's cash only, or you might be forced to use the ATM in the shop and I don't know what that thing charges, but I bet it's closer to something than nothing. &#160;Always great! What is there to say other than that this is the absolute best Hawaiian restaurant in all of Seattle. &#160;Period. &#160;Everything on the menu is so delicious and all the prices so wonderfully cheap, nothing can beat it. &#160;I really don't know what to say other than try the combination plates and the spam musubis. &#160;They are all to die for. great food, cheap prices, got there at 11 and was &#160;the only one there lolordered the mochiko chicken + chicken katsu plate with fried rice and fried egg. &#160;The mochiko chicken was alright, alot more batter then meat, the chicken katsu was good and the fried rice was delicious. &#160;The good thing is that this plate lunch is cheaper then most places in Oahu, will come again in a couple of weeks when i make my next trip down to seattle! wish we had a place like this in Vancouver..wait maybe not i'd just eat there all day and get even fatter! ONO! I love the food here but they don't accept cards! Such a serious negative!! Won't come back just for that reason. It's ridiculous that in 2011 business are still cash only. Good food, Gossip owner, fun dining placeIf i go there order something for lunch, im such the leftover could be my dinner! LOTS of FOOD! and Super tasty! i love the grill chicken! the menu on da wall just provides too many choices! and everything looks sooo goooood, sometimes i don't know what to order!for your advice:1) if you have no idea what to order, #41 will never let you down! 2) good food worth waiting, so be prepared (about 15 mins if its busy) 3) group...not a good idea4) table is kinda of sticky... I don't know why it took me so long to try out this place! This place is so much better than your regular chain BBQ restaurants and they give huge portions for such a small price! There are so many options on the menu and it seems to be always busy.The only downfall of this place is that it's small, cold (during winter time) and it takes them awhile to cook the food.But overall, if you're on a budget and looking for good food, this is the place to be! The parking is super easy.I can see why this place is still open on the AVE considering so many other places have shut down.But this place only accepts cash! so be ready and bring cash with you! After a lengthy hike in the western Cascades, no one from the group felt in the mood to prepare dinner, so instead we opted to grab a couple orders of take-out from an old favorite of ours in the University District; Hawaii BBQ Restaurant. At about six or seven dollars for a dish, the amount of food that is served to you is a definite steal as, even for fairly hefty eaters such as myself, one order is enough for me to be flirting with that fine line between decent fullness and possible immobility. The two dishes that we ordered were the Theta Chi plate and the Hawaii Club plate which both consist of an egg on Spam fried rice and Mochiko chicken paired with teriyaki chicken and chicken katsu respectively. Check our pictures if you are unsure about what these two dishes look like, but be reminded that if you visit this restaurant without ordering the Mochiko chicken then you have basically wasted your time. While the restaurant is fairly clean, probably about average for any restaurant on the street, the staff is friendly and will often strike up a conversation when the restaurant is not busy. Although there is a bit of a wait, it is nothing unbearable and the reward at the end is completely worth it; a freshly cooked dish worthy of seducing its customers to become weekday regulars. My favorite place for fast asian food!!Everytime I come to this place, the cashier always tries to make my friends pay for me, and then makes me feel bad for paying for my own food. LOL cracks me up! He is friendly, and makes you feel comfortable as you are waiting for the food.. sometimes uncomfortable in a friendly way.Everything I've ever tried has been good. My favorite though is the "Hawaiian BBQ Mix". Comes with everything delicious. Chicken, Beef, and Shortfibs. It's enough to share for two because it comes with so much food, but Kenny and I have to both get our own because it is so good, you wont want to share!! I recommened to ask for the macaroni salad instead of the steamed vegi's. Both are good, but macaroni is better. If you want fried rice instead of white rice, that's ok too :)Seems like anything is possible here. AND you will never get sick of it. In fact, writing about it makes me want some now!! Gosh I wish I still lived in the U-District!! Came here today with a craving for something hearty and believe me I found the spot......ordered the curry katsu chicken and at $5.95 I was expecting an average teriyaki plate without the salad.....boy was I wrong! this thing was easily large enough to feed two hungry people! and I have a serious appetite! For 6 bucks seriously???? how does this guy make any money giving away this much food?! The quality of the chicken katsu was great....like you would expect at any teriyaki joint...the rice was a bit mushy but oh well it was 6 bucks and I got hella food....the curry gravy was kinda bland and didn't really spice up the dish at all but o well it was 6 bucks and I got hella food....the elderly Asian man running the show was super nice and gave me extra bbq sauce for my chicken....this is going to be one of my regulars for whenever I eat on the ave....and the big plus is that there is no msg in the food! overall quality is not the best...but maybe it was because of that dish alone...other dishes I saw people around me devouring were pretty tasty looking....especially my friend's chicken and chow mein dish....another big plus is that the menu seems to allow a lot of creations and mix and matches...you get quite a variety of different assorted meats and helpings on some of the plates....Price is super cheap and really reasonable....Will definately be back like a million times this upcoming quarter. LOTS. OF. GOOD. FOOD. FOR. CHEAP.The Alpha Sig Plate is my personal favorite. Love how they cook the Chicken Katsu here too. And DAMN do they give you a lot of food!Best cheap eat: $2.50 for the largest Hum Bow you've ever seen. MMMMM YES.Huge menu with pictures of all the plates to help you.The food and the deals here will make you forget that it can sometimes be not so clean on the inside - it can get busy and they usually don't have more than 2 or 3 people working, but of course carry out is always an option too.GO. HERE. NOW! I have yet to meet a dish here that I don't like. This is one place where having a favorite dish puts you at a disadvantage: with 50+ options, you really should just try 'em all.They recently became a cardless establishment, so remember to BRING CASH or pay some annoying ATM fees. Be prepared for a longer wait, especially during peak hours. But believe me, it's worth waiting for. Hits the spot when I'm feeling homesick. &#160;The chicken katsu is as good as, or even better than the katsu back in Hawaii. &#160;Katsu sauce isn't different, but a good different! &#160;The portions are huge, and the prices are good. &#160;It really can't get better than that. Decent 'local' food. &#160;A little on the greasy side.
I've been to Araya's a lot, so it's probably time to write a review. In the interests of full disclosure, I am a complete germophobe and I have absolutely no faith in the personal hygiene habits of just about every other human on the face of the Earth which means that my personal rule is that a) I don't eat samples in the grocery store that are just sitting on a platter in the middle of the aisle, and b) I don't eat from buffet restaurants. Yes, I have seen the sneeze guards, and no, I don't think they are effective. I've seen more than one person stick their head under the sneeze guard to get a good look and/or sniff of the food. So, with all that preamble out of the way, the weekend buffet at Araya's is so good that I am able to supress my innate aversion to buffets and just enjoy everything. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that the food is all vegan and the wait staff at Araya's are just so nice.The wife and I have also dined at Araya's when the buffet is not on, and their a la carte items are wonderful. The last time we were there for dinner, one of the chefs came out and gave us a sample of the evening's special appetizer (a delicious corn fritter). Araya's is a little rough around the edges - it is in the U District after all - but if you look past that you will see this place for the little vegan jewel that it is. I live pretty much a mile away from this establishment, and when I am on a vegetable craze (pretty much 24/7), I am always craving Araya's. They do not get 5 stars from me because of their incredibly slow service. I usually get their green curry with asparagus here, and it came out lukewarm once. The place wasn't even that packed, so this was a disappointment. They are just generally slow around here. Regardless, their food is so good here. They know how to treat their vegetables. Vegetables need to be nurtured in a specific way--let them be their natural, sexy selves. Do not try to dress them in five different oils and hundreds of spices and allow them to be soggy/upset-looking. A lot of vegetarian places around the U-District offer your run-of-the-mill, cheap vegetables like broccoli and canned mushrooms. That is just blasphemy. I thoroughly enjoy that Araya's offer a variety of vegetables like bamboo shoots, asparagus, bell peppers, snow peas, etc. Their vegetables are not soggy and overcooked, and they do not try to cover up its natural taste with a convoluted mess of flavors and spices. At the same time, their dishes are far from bland. Phad thai and the curries are all good across the table. $8.99 Thai Buffet!What an awesome find!There are a lot of Thai Restaurants in Seattle, but not many Buffet's. &#160;My usual Thai order would consist either something with tofu,vegetables and/or peanut sauce and my fiance's, "Chicken" Pad Thai. &#160;We are not a vegans and Araya is a Vegan Friendly Restaurant. &#160;I do however, love my veggies and felt like a kid in a candy store! My fianc&#233; on the other hand, enjoyed the Pad Thai and the "pancit" like version, but had to ask, "where's the chicken?" The tofu just didn't cut it for him! lol He would rather eat at or take out Thai, where as I, loved the endless vegan!Outcome: We left full and happy! Thank you my fellow Yelpers, for guiding me to this great place!TIPS: - Private Lot with Limited Parking.- Vegan - Vegan / Gluten Free BakeryHours Vary:- Lunch Buffet Everyday: 11:30am - 3:30pm- Breakfast Served Monday - Friday: 7:00am - 11:00am- Lunch / Dinner: Monday - Thursday: 11:30am - 9:30pm- Lunch / Dinner: Friday and Saturday: 11:30am - 10:00pm Soo I'm at the consensus now after much intricate and detailed research (I eat, I feel bad or good afterwards, I take notice) that I generally feel better the more vegetables I eat. You may believe this is all perhaps TMI and has nothing to do with Araya, but I'm getting there. While I am sooo down with some bombastic Mexican carnitas piled high with guac, sweet n tangy BBQed pulled pork, Paseo's slices of puercos heaven on french bread, or a juicy little steakhouse baseball fillet once in a while, I love finding vegetarian restaurants that feature flavors so delicious you don't miss the meat. Araya is one of them, and their lunch buffet is a real winner. My stomach thanks me, and at Araya, my wallet does too. Traveler's Thali in Beacon Hill is also a great inexpensive veggie option that you may forget you're skipping the meats:http://www.yelp.com/biz/&#8230;The buffet has delicious brown rice, stewed veggies curries, rice noodles, steamed veggies and tofu, tom ka, and my favorite Thai desserts. Thai iced teas come to the table in large, elegant glasses. Get yours with coconut milk to boost your good fats many veggie purists may lack. Hit up the U District farmer's market like a good psuedo-veggie like myself and treat yourself here afterwards. Araya's is a restaurant that has been around for decades and will continue to be. &#160;They have what I would describe as a cult following, encompassing a wide range of the community. The food is very good. &#160;I've eaten off of the menu as well as the buffet at least 10 times each. &#160;The only knock against it would be their price. &#160;It is slightly too expensive to compete for 5 stars with the other Thai restaurants on the ave. &#160;The price isn't shocking though. &#160;Everyone knows it comes with the territory in regards to vegetarian restaurants. &#160;I would highly recommend the bean thread noodles as well as the infamous spring rolls. &#160;In terms of the atmosphere the staff keeps its awfully consistent. &#160;I've been going here for over 4 years and its always been the same. &#160;You can count on a relaxed setting with friendly and helpful staff. &#160;Be sure to bring your friends, they certainly have the seating to accommodate! While Visiting Seattle. I came here with a friend. I was surprised by all the vegan options. We had pot stickers which were fabulous crispy and not soggy.I enjoyed a noodle dish vague I know. But I can't remember the name. One thing I do remember it was fabulous. I love that you can pick how hot youWant your spices to be , Huge plus. The waitress was nice and helpful. She wasn't overbearing and left us alone to eat. The atmosphere was quite , The decorations and style of the restaurant was very interesting cool dragons, plants and little figurines all over the place. Continues to be a great vegan Thai restaurant. You have to try the pumpkin curry! Yum! The daily lunch buffet is awesome. The egg rolls are amazing. The avocado curry is really good, and their Tom Kha soup is also really good. Super friendly service and reasonably priced. I've been here several times, and except for once the lunch buffet has always satisfied (one time everything seemed bland and boring). I do use a fair amount of hot chili sauce to kick it up. &#160;Spring rolls perfectly crispy. &#160;Guilt-free vegan food, yay!! &#160;I also dig their lemongrass soup, but not fond of the sweet and sour. Service leaves you to yourself ... but it ends up being okay because the food is so good. Try the Pa-Nang curry, beautifully presented Araya's Asparagus, Drunken Mushrooms, and Phad Phet Makhua with brown rice. Also try the brown rice tea! Excellent Thai food. I hadn't been there since they were on the Ave, but my wife and I stopped there the other day. &#160;It's only gotten better. &#160;Neither of us are vegetarian, yet we both thought it was the best Thai we've had in years. Really tasty food, great service, very nice restaurant. I would absolutely suggest this for any vegetarian who is looking for a new place to try. Parking is a pain - I wanted to rage on this man who parked in 2 parking spots when the parking was clearly packed. I hosted about 20 people for a birthday party here. It was wonderful. The food? Great. Their patience with the crowd? Even better. They went out of their way to accommodate us. I had the cashew delight, and it was wonderful. The veggies were perfectly cooked and the sauce was very flavorful. After four of my friends ordered the Thai iced coffeee, I did too. Again, fabulous. I am vegan, but most of my friends are not, and some need to eat gluten free diets, and all found something to eat. The food, atmosphere, and service was great. I am so glad that I chose this restaurant! I will say that this is probably the most professional of the vegan restaurants that I have been to so far in Seattle. I could not have imagined doing this in any of the other ones. &#160;It's vegan, but not in an overbearing way ideologically. The prices are also very fair. Got take out, but wanted to stay for the buffet. It looked and smelled awesome. The tom yum soup was excellent, as were the fresh rolls. I've been dying to go back for thai buffet. The lunch buffet is amazing, I bring people here all the time and it is instantly their favorite restaurant. As a vegetarian, I really appreciate this place. &#160;As a completely vegetarian restaurant, I actually get stressed out trying to figure out what to choose to eat here. &#160;And, it's a great place to take my family because we can order so much more and have so many more options! &#160;Everything is really good - although I think the one dish that was a little disappointing was the eggplant dish. &#160;Besides that, everything I've tried has been extremely tasty - ranging from the pumpkin, avocado, and panang curries, to the noodles, soups, and appetizers. &#160;One thing that's also nice is that they have weekend buffets! &#160;And as a vegetarian, it's exciting to actually be able to eat everything out of the buffet (though if you like spicy food, like me, the buffet food is a bit too mild, so I'd recommend just paying for a real meal) def. one of my favorite places in the u district, if I could cook like this I would be vegan, I'll just have to stick with vegetarian.
I've been eating at Araya's for over 10 years (waay back when they were on the Ave) and I still love it. I had my UW graduation dinner here with a small group of friends/family and the service was quick, food was shared family-style, and everyone loved it.The Tofu Larb salad is really good (it's better than Larb Gai!) and the kitchen was able to make it for me without raw onion. Even though it's a salad, I still have to eat it with rice and it's sufficient for a meal (cold or warm). The portions of the main menu items (curry, noodles, etc.) are large enough to share between 2 people. The soups can probably easily feed 3-4 people for one order (at least for me, I've always shared it and still had enough for take home). There's no worry for me to eat here since everything is vegan and I don't have to worry about any seafood/shellfish allergy reactions. The kitchen staff are also really helpful about other types of food allergies, spiciness levels and answering any questions about recommended menu items. I've brought many non-vegan friends here, and all were impressed! We were excited to try vegan Thai food at a place that knows how to make Thai food truly vegan. We had no idea there was a lunch buffet so at $8.99 for all you can eat it was very surprising. We decided to try it. For the money it's a good deal. They have a bunch of dishes. &#160;Yellow Curry, Tom Yum Soup, stir fried vegetables, steamed vegetables, vegetable spring rolls, pad thai, salad and some other dishes I don't know. I wished they had had more than 1 curry, but that's ok, yellow curry is still good. The pad thai was a little greasy, but still ok. They also have a bunch of different vegan desserts, but by then we were so stuffed there was no way we could get some. I took some photos of it though. &#160;They have some gluten free ones as well. I wish we had stayed longer so we could come for dinner and order off the menu. &#160;I would come back, it's run by friendly people and was nice to find a vegan Thai place. The lunch buffet is such a great deal! For only $8.99, you can get yourself filled on various vegetarian dishes ranging from egg rolls to soup and phad thai. &#160;I'm not a vegetarian but I really enjoy having lunch here. &#160;I highly recommend giving their peanut sauce a shot. &#160;I thought it went well with most of the dishes I ate it with. I personally think this is the perfect place to have a meal with both vegetarian and non-vegetarian friends. &#160;Give it a shot when you have time! Sometimes it is hard to find a comfortable place to sit here. Food is good but i have had some of their dishes prepared better at other locations. All in all its a good place to eat. love that its all veggie! This is an awesome vegetarian place!! I think that the best deal is the lunch buffet. &#160;The buffet has usually 6 - 7 different entrees and dessert. &#160;If you don't have time to eat in you can get a takeout container of the lunch buffet stuff. &#160;The dinner is usually pretty crowded... definitely try the spring rolls they are served with sesame seed honey which is an awesome twist. &#160;Overall everything tastes good. &#160;Don't forget to get a Thai iced tea you can even get it with soy milk and the glass is huge!! I really like vegetarian thai food and this place does not disappoint. It was definitely a good lunch spot back when I was a college student. They have good all you can eat soup, phad Thai and rice pudding for a great price! My husband and I ate here tonight and everything we got was DELICIOUS! &#160;We ordered the Arayas Salad, Tom Kah soup &amp; How Mok. &#160;Everything was fresh, the vegetables were crisp and not overcooked and all of our dishes were super tasty. &#160;We loved the affordable wine selection, we didn't have to wait long for our food to come out, it was a good value, and the service was great. &#160;Vegan or not, the food here is very good and I highly recommend this restaurant! &#160;YUM! Based on the lunch buffet, this place has the most delicious vegetarian/vegan food around. They also proudly display many activist leaflets and posters, which a lot of similar restaurants seem scared of doing. They are currently looking for a Bellevue location, and I for one will be over the moon if that comes to fruition! The buffet is great, but the dinner menu is fantastic. HOLY MOLY!!! This place was super tasty! I went today for lunch thanks to a groupon from a friend, but I pass by every day on my way to work. I hate to say I've been narrow minded about it because it says Vegetarian on the sign ... I learned today just try it and enjoy.  I tried the Pad Thai with 2 stars ... definitely could use more spice so next time I will do 4 stars. My FAVE of the day was the Asparagus Hunsa ... WOW! Loved it! Yet again I should have added a little more spice, but this was my first time here and I didn't know just how spicy their stars were. Will definitely go back!!! Mostly I've been there for their lunch buffet. While it's exciting to have so many vegan options at once, I always feel like they're not all that great. Worth going to once in awhile, but not really amazing food.I'd always heard that the food is so much better when you order off the menu, so I went for dinner. While the menu definitely offers more interesting variety than I am used to in veg. Thai restaurants, the food was again disappointing. Maybe I just didn't order the best things. I imagine that there are some things there that are just incredible...I just think everything on the menu should be... Myself and two other members of BBN9K decided to try the wares that Araya's had to offer. On all accounts of the 5 people that came, we all came away thoroughly pleased; impressed even. This is the first establishment that I have tried to eat strictly vegetarian and had thoughts of running for a burger at times but pushed through. We ordered the Drunken Mushrooms, Tom Yum Soup, Spicy Noodle, Avocado Curry and the Asparagus Hunsa. To varying degrees, all the dishes were quite delicious. My personal favorite was the Drunken Mushrooms and the Avocado Curry was surprisingly good as well. Nom nom nom. I mean, what can I say? Fast, friendly service, delicious food and good company made for a scrumptulescent experience. They even have their own private parking lot! I am already fiending for another excursion. The food here is really yummy and buffet is a bargain! The staff are friendly and I loved the atmosphere. Only problem I had was that nothing was labeled at the buffet so a couple of things I got weren't what I would say bad, just not my taste so I felt bad leaving it on the plate uneaten. Overall a pleasant experience :-) this place is DELICIOUS. &#160;well most of the items on the menu.i normally don't do vegetarian cuisine because i'm a full-blown carnivore. &#160;when i get a little cilantro as garnish, i'll eat that and consider my mission accomplished in terms of veggie consumption. &#160;i must say, this place is really pretty good. &#160;the prices aren't much to cheer or complain about, but that's whatever if you're getting yummy food. &#160;i've had all their curries at least 3 times and i've never had a bad batch. &#160;i don't recommend the fried rice, however. &#160;it's just not as good as the fried rice you'd get a chinese place (but that could be my chinese side speaking). &#160;their buffet is what really gets me. &#160;i love it. &#160;it's never really that crowded, the food is rotated so it's fresh, and it's $9 or something. &#160;amazing. &#160;araya's is consistent. &#160;that's the most important thing to me. &#160;if you get the pad thai and you like it, it'll be that same pad thai you liked next time. &#160;if you didn't like it, you know what to avoid. Friend 1: Do you want thai for lunch? Me: Yes, Let's get Thai Tom. Friend 2: How about Araya's?Friend 1: Yes, ARAYA"S NOM NOM NOM. Me: The vegetarian place? Friend 1: Yep. So good. Me: No thanks. Friend 2: We're going with or without you. Me: But I'm a carnivore.......(As I get in the car with them)---- Arrival at what is a packed dining area on a Saturday ---- Me: This is going to be a while, let's go to thai tom. Look at that 20 person line. Friend 1: It will move fast --- And it did. Very quickly. Fresh thai brought out every 20. Friend 2: Alright, the line died down. Let's get in there. Me: Ok. Since we're here. ---As I look around and the delicious, sweet smell of curry, and distinct blend of spices hits my nose, I realize this is no ordinary vegetarian food. ---Fastforward 2 hours and 4 plates later. Me: It was ok. Server: You need to leave, you've been eating foreverrrrrrr. Friend 1: See I knew you'd like it. It is fantastic and I am a self - proclaimed neanderthal meat eater. Most of my meals revolve around a protein. In this instance at this wonderful restaurant I realize you can have incredible flavor without killing animals. It won't make me vegetarian for more than a meal at a time when I get to enjoy this buffet indulgence, But I will not be so hesitant in the future. I really never thought I'd like fake meat. I'd previously only been to the awesome lunch buffet (and I mean awesome), but came for dinner last night with a friend. I ordered the drunken mushrooms which is essentially vegan pad kee mao with lots of mushrooms and fake meat. Honestly if you hadn't told me that I was eating no animal products I wouldn't have realized it at all-- if this is what being vegan is like maybe I should stop knocking it, eh? The noodles were flavourful and soft without being too gooey or chewy (a mistake easily made by most Thai places) and the peppers were wonderfully crunchy and juicy. You can put mushrooms into any dish and I'll probably love it and this was no exception. Huge chunks of delicious earthy goodness acted like sponges for the spicy Thai flavours-- super amazing. Also! A pot of tea to share (or to hoard if you're that type) is only $3.50. Yes? Yes. Totally perfect :) Vegan Thai Buffet!!!!!!!!!!!! &#160;Mostly bland food until you slather on the peanut sauce. &#160;Unlimited spring rolls are what good dreams are made of. I had never been to an all-vegetarian asian restaurant, but Araya's offered a vegetarian lunch buffett and the spring rolls were deep-fried perfection! The fried rice was fresh and buttery and the tofu was cooked just right. I didn't.care too much for the soup (I'm not a huge cilantro fan) or the black sticky rice (it tasted like bland mush with a hint of sweetness). But I am definitely interested to go back and check out the dinner selection! I went with my three girlfriends on a Friday early evening, and it wasn't busy yet (by the time we left, the restaurant was more than half full). Although I'm not a vegetarian, I love vegetarian foods as long as the food is fresh, of good quality, and delicious. That's pretty much my criteria for any restaurant. This restaurant fell flat in its salads - lots of iceberg lettuce and large flavorless tomatoes that had been clearly refrigerated. A salad can't be good when the ingredients are tasteless and not fresh (the sauce was ok, but it didn't make up for the rest). We also ordered a drunken noodles dish that was pretty tasty. However, there's something in the sauce (MSG perhaps) that made my mouth very dry later. The portion sizes are very large, so I'm glad we ordered family style. The service is great, and the people are nice. I just wish the food was better quality. Wonderful service!!! &#160;Was in the area and have been meaning to check out this place. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. &#160;I got lots of attention especially for having a to-go order. &#160;Great touches was when one nice server asked about which yoga studio I came from, and conversed with me,recommending another studio I should check out. &#160;Another male server went above and beyond to carve the meat out of a fresh coconut so I could take it to-go. &#160;It's been a long time since I've had genuinely good service especially on a Friday night.I ordered the pad thai and basil fried rice. &#160;I should have remembered my cardinal rule: &#160;If you've never been to a particular restaurant before, order below your spice level because you don't know how spicy they are!So let's say their spicy #3 is quite hot-often the #4 in other restaurants so keep that in mind.Food came out piping hot in a very generous portion ( yay lunch and dinner for tomorrow!), but one less star for the flavors.Pad thai was instantly too sweet for my preference, however noodles were cooked well and I liked how they cooked and cut the tofu.Basil fried rice had a unique smell to it, to which I accredit the thin strips of bamboo shoots. &#160;The texture of the rice was beyond amazing, however I added my own soy sauce because I didn't get too much flavor coming out. &#160;I really liked all the vegetables including cabbage, which I typically do not enjoy in a fried rice.Major kudos for having gluten free dessert options. &#160;Didn't have a sweet tooth at the moment, but I am excited to try them in the future.I think I'll order something different next time, but will definitely return for the great ambiance and service. This is review for the lunch buffet. It was awesome! The black sticky rice pudding was mouthwatering but after stuffing myself with pad thai and curry as well as the ever famous crispy spring rolls and steamed veggies drenched in peanut sauce. &#160;Amazing and totally worth it since most thai places charge you more than $8.99 for one entree. Too bad there's no discount for kids or seniors. Oh well... After giving Araya's a second chance I must say that it has become one of my favorite veggie Seattle restaurants. &#160;The drunken mushroom dish is wonderful! The service is much better (perhaps it was a one-time fluke). Very good even though I usually don't eat vegitarian nor do I ever spell it lol. Accidentally went on the day of all you can eat buffet and it was a extremely satisfying meal I recommend to anyone Who says only vegetables are not good enough to satisfy our taste??? Araya's Place is THE ONE PLACE you want to go when you are craving for Thai food, and really want to eat healthy. This place is very spacious, and the decoration is extrodinary, brings out the Thai culture and made me feel cozy and comfortable while enjoying the tasty food of Araya's. You don't need to be a vegan to eat here ! For one dish that I reccoment the most is the Tom-Yom Soup, which was my first choice for my hang over !!!!! The service was extrodinary, the wait staff were always very friendly and nice ! &#160;Thank you for being there, Araya's !!! Great food, friendly staff, willing to accommodate dietary restrictions (though you should always double-check because communication errors have been made between the waiting staff and the cooks). The restaurant is very clean and has a pleasant atmosphere- not your typical U District restaurant. There is a small parking lot available for customers. The BEST buffet. Ever. I dont even know what half the things I ate today even are, but hot damn, delicious. Hands down my favorite coconut curry soup anywhere. The veggies are always perfectly cooked, never mushy. The spring rolls....... I could eat here everyday. The ADORABLE gals up front crack me up. They are very personable and I always end up chatting with them for a bit. Yes. Don't understand the criticism about the lunch buffet at all. It's vegetarian nirvana for me. My daughters and I go here often for lunch and have always found it to be fresh and well-stocked with a nice variety of very yummy choices. I love their brown rice, spring rolls, black rice pudding. I could go on. If you're vegetarian, I don't know any place in town that can beat this and at this price.Above and beyond this, the family that owns Araya's REALLY understands the value of a warm greeting and customer service. No complaints whatsoever. Keep on keepin' on, Araya's! Lunch buffet is Ayyyyyy OK. &#160; For a carnivore like myself, didn't miss not animal in my meal one bit. there are too many wonderful things to say about Arayas. I am a huge fan of their lunch buffet. The curry and phad thai is consistently delicious and I find myself craving their peanut sauce all the time. If you miss the lunch buffet be sure that you do not miss the avocado curry dish! The staff are some of the nicest people around so whether you are vegetarian or not be sure to eat here!
Let me make one thing clear...I really do love this place but need to comment on my last visit in the hopes that the situation won't happen again.Went in for lunch with one of my work mates. &#160;Stood in line waiting to order. &#160;Noted that cashier was having issues with register.Cashier asked us what we wanted and we gave her our order. &#160;She did not take money.She turned in our order and we waited (and waited for her to ask to take our money).We then got back in line and when we got to her we asked for her to take our money. She then ran back and checked &#160;on order....and we waited and waited.She walked by us with our order and took &#160;it to another table.Anyhoo we order Shwarma and Jumbo GyroWe weren't asked about the sauce that should be on Shwarma.Both items in spite of it all were delicious...but waiting almost 25 minutes for our food (and being given the food in to go packaging when we asked for a sit down order) was very frustrating...and this is a place that I truly do love.I will absolutely be back....and hope...it won't be a repeat...it can't...it won't...I have faith in you Gyro House.
I've eaten here several times over the last few years because it's close to my office. I keep hoping it will be good, but it never is. The Falafel are hard greasy little rocks which will inevitably cause gastric distress. The lamb is tough. The flavors are uninspired. If you're really hungry, it's food, but there are so many better options nearby, why waste your time and money?
Starting with 3 stars: +1 for location: Very close to my office. An easy walk unless its raining. +1 for flavor/quality: The food is flavorful and nicely prepared. Orders come with fries which seem a little odd, but I'm a big fan of fries so I'm not going to complain about that... -1 for price: As others have stated the prices here are a little on the high side. You can get the same food at a number of other locations for less money. Quality may or may not be as high at those other places. NOTES: It gets a little busy during lunch rush so you can expect to wait in line. You also have to bus your own table and orders come on paper plates so this isn't fine dinning by any length of the imagination. I ordered the falafel sandwich and it wasn't very good and a terrible value. The pita had three half falafels set in it and a bunch of fries to fill it out. The fries were soggy and the falafel was lost in the pile of lettuce and sauce. I've been here before and it wasn't the rip off it is now.
I enjoy the general ambiance of this place; the dark wood, the fireplace, &#160;separate areas for separate interests. &#160;We went a few times for breakfast and the food is quite good, though i seem to recall it being a bit heavy (and meat-centric). &#160;The first time we went it was slow and quiet and the service was excellent: friendly and quick. &#160;However, the seating wasn't terribly comfortable (the booth seat I was in was actually broken). &#160;And I understand it's an Irish pub, I do. &#160;Nonetheless, the second time we went there was a futbal game on and it was crazy loud and busy and the service was really slow. &#160;The TV alone was set to ear-shattering.Would I go again? &#160;Only if there's no futbal game on Meh. I'm always a fan of a good Irish pub, however this one isn't really a "good" Irish pub. It's your typical Americanized version thereof--it is a chain, after all. Which is fine. I've been for happy hour a few times, and it's always packed, which can make things interesting. However, there is a lack of any decent happy hour drink prices; maybe a random mixed drink special here or there. They've got some great happy hour eats, but a bit on the small side for what the prices are. Top that all of with service leaving a lot to be desired, and you get a 3-star "meh."The one thing I will rave about is the boxty fries--delicious. The Irish really do know potatoes.Generally not a bad place to go. Good food. Usually on the crowded side. My mind has just never been blown. I went here last night and got charged $10 for an Irish Car Bomb, or as they called it an "Irish Settler" not excited about that. All my friends had to pay $6 for pints of beer as well. Seems like they might be better at HH but as for now, I am not convinced and my pocketbook is hating them. I happened to walk in here on a Thursday night, and I was unpleasantly greeted by the sounds of really bad live music not unlike.....REM? What? A cover band is here? No. Not even close. There were just some really, really drunk REM fans in the back. Annoying.I had a pint of Guinness ($5.00 well spent) and my friend and I tried to order some bar food. We wanted chicken tenders, the cheese dip, and brown bread ice cream. We were hungry - stop judging.Our waitress came back with chicken tenders, cheese dip, and...no ice cream. We reminded her about the ice cream because we were serious about it. She came back with the check sans ice cream. We reminded her about the ice cream again, and she said, "I thought you were joking" and walked away. Thanks, YOU STUPID ICE CREAM THIEF. So to be clear from the start, this is a review of how Fado functions as a sports bar (specifically soccer), which, I am aware, is not the reason that everyone goes there...Starting with a negative, the TVs aren't big or particularly well placed. &#160;Only a few of the tables really afford a good view of a TV and if it's crowded this can be an issue. &#160;Additionally, the times I've gone to watch a Sounders away game, one whole room (with reasonably located TV) was reserved by a Sounders fan club. &#160;I am not saying that all spaces should revolve around the television (at the time I didn't even have one in my house) but considering that the bar advertises its soccer matches heavily (see the Web site) one would think it would have a more TV-viewing-centric layout.Second the bar food is...well...bar food. &#160;My girlfriend and I tried a few things: the fries were, predictably, greasy, so we went with hummus and pita wedges. &#160;To our surprise the pita wedges were...yep...greasy and deep fried. &#160;Awesome.On the plus side, the servers were always helpful and didn't keep pressuring me to buy drinks throughout the game, a huge issue in a sports bar. &#160;The drinks themselves were good and the Bailey's / whiskey coffee is a great way to end...warm and alcoholic.All in all Fado is a pleasant bar...not really a soccer bar (which it is trying to be...this isn't something I'm forcing upon it) but if that's not what you're going for then I recommend it... The first time, it was on St. Patrick's Day and it was packed. There was a live band playing. I really enjoyed the atmosphere.Yesterday, I went there for the 2nd time. A regular weekdays, there wasn't anything specific going one. I had one of those corned beef boxty for dinner. It was great! I loved the horse radish creamy sauce. I am not a beer drinker, but I tried Harp Lager and Boddingtons. I was happy that I tried! For an entire year, when we worked at the Norton Building across the street, we have never attempted to dine here and what a missed opportunity it was.Our group made it in after a project meeting for the four to seven happy hour which amazingly happens every day of the week. Ordered a pitcher of Pyramid Hefeweizen and a couple of fish tacos with a side order of calamari. What caught us by surprise was how subtlety delicious the fried calamari was, especially for an Irish pub, since a majority of happy hours place calamari on the menu simply because it is a relatively easy and effortless dish to cook. In addition to a light topping of cheese and banana peppers, the calamari was complemented by a light refreshing dipping sauce of what is believed to be a tomato puree of sorts. Although we did not personally order the fish tacos, the rest of our party swore that they were the best fish tacos they have had in the past two years so perhaps that is a testament to either the quality of the food or their level of inebriation.Next time we come back up to Seattle, we are definitely going to stop by again since we seem to travel in larger groups and the pub is organized to host larger soccer viewing events anyhow. Irish? More like Americanrish.Fado does have great food and a nice selection of beers, but it's not really a true Irish Pub. For one, they don't even carry soda bread. Oh come on! I've only been there on 'quiet' days when there aren't any games on, so I can't speak for those times, but normally it's not too bad. Like I said, the food, especially the HH items like the Happy Burger, hit the spot for a decent price. However, the service on quiet days can be slow, which doesn't bode well for busy days. The decor is a nice earthy gloom, which makes it cool to sit with a group and have a discussion or something (probably about something gloomy). I'd go to Fado just because it's close to work, and it has food, but it would be at the bottom of my list for a true Irish place. Cheers! I went here a couple days ago for the world cup game (USA!!!!)..The service was good, the place is awesome.. there is a lot to look at, i love how many rooms there are to explore in.. the place is huge!!However.. I ordered a veggie Quesadilla and it was god awful, i couldn't finish it.. The cheese was so .. weird tasting.. and i didn't realize i didn't like artichoke till i had this, though i feel that if you like artichoke there is a good chance you will like this because it's literally filled with almost exclusively that.. yay me.. Because of the other things that i did like about this place i am willing to give it another try (the restaurant but not the quesadilla) The food is weak, the beer is good, and there is a decent soccer crowd on game days. &#160;The servers are inked up, which is not my thing. This review is a little annoying for me to write because I don't often like chains and this place is so heavily reviewed. However I have to give it some public praise because it is just a solid offering in a great location. The service has always been helpful and the food is very good as well. My visits have ranged from being extremely loud and many many beers at night hanging out with my Angel City Brigade friends who are Galaxy supporters from LA, to morning visits with kids before the St. Patty parade. The servers have always been fast and friendly and the ambiance is great as well. I like the layout of the place. Sure some of the bartenders play the "I'm really cool because I'm a bartender" role but who cares, let em have their fun. It opens early for soccer, rugby, etc and has a good morning menu as well. The only knock is that the draft beer menu is on the bland side (call the Stone reps guys) but the Guinness pour is good. I liked it!I especially liked going toward the back of the establishment, where they seemed to have two tree trunks coming out of the floors in into the ceilings! &#160;Great live music and the decor is fun. &#160;My friends and I had a good time here. &#160;We had been to another place right before coming, so we didn't order too many drinks or food, but from what I've read...maybe I'll come back for HH. Watching World Cup with a room full of people during lunch can be so exciting. I was watching two games at the same time. &#160;The service was a bit slow but they do have a whole pub full of people. I ordered the Trinity Boxty. I had forgotten how much I like boxty until I saw it on the menu. =) &#160;There is also a World Cup special lunch menu (beer + sandwich for 12.95). Well since my last trip in I have been back twice, the service was impeccable! &#160;Always had my drinks and food prompt and fast. &#160;Wait staff was great friendly and were always smiling!I've always been a fan of the other Irish place around the corner, but my date &amp; I skipped that place to just come here!Thanks Fado! &#160;You've just gotten a true patron 4 Life!Now if we can just get those big tv's turned on... hint hint.. the only reason wasn't 5 stars.. music was good, but you got those huge tv's turn them on to some sporting event! &#160;Futbol preseason is starting back up! Great Spot!Stumbled across this place on my last trip to Seattle. Ended up stopping in for happy hour. We were very impressed. This is not your average pub food - the items were far more complex. I specifically remember the excellent lamp cutlets with a sweet sauce, but everything was tasty.Cool layout with different sections around the bar. Service was great too.And who wouldn't appreciate a great selection of beers. If you haven't had one, try a Smithwicks (pronounced smith-icks). Always one of my favs when I find it. Like an 'Irish Newcastle.' Stumbled across this jewel of a pub while coming back from Pioneer Square. Friendly people working there, a welcoming mix of patrons and of course, they pour a good pint with a generous shot of irish whiskey. Wish I could be there to see a soccer match when the place must really get going. Highly recommended. I've been here time and time again for one item: The lamb sandwich. &#160;Seriously, screw everything else. &#160;The lamb is where its at. &#160;Just think about it, where have you had good lamb in Seattle? &#160;That's right, there are no other places that make lamb sandwiches like they make them here. &#160;Come here and get that lamb sandwich and dip it in that delicious, rich and thick au jus made from the drippings. &#160;Its to die for, and even better after a few drinks. &#160;Fado's is a great place to go with a group at night, just remember to go for the obvious beverages(Stouts and Guinness) and you'll be a-ok. &#160;Not the place for pinky drinks. &#160;The ambiance here is great at night, moody lighting and unique furniture distinguish it from other places. &#160;Highly recommended for that one killer item. We hit 5 bars in one night this weekend and of them all this was my favorite. &#160;The service was prompt and friendly and the atmosphere was pleasant. &#160; The only complaint I have is that I ordered the cheesesteak sandwich and the waitress came out and said they were out of the cheesesteak meat, so would chicken be ok? &#160;Umm... no. &#160;A chicken sandwich isn't even close to a cheesesteak sandwich. &#160;The food prices are kind of high for a bar and for the portions you get, but the food is good. &#160;One word of warning, check the game schedules if you're going to go. &#160;Our first attempt at going it was full of neon green soccer fans wearing scarves (in August???) and there was nowhere to sit so we had to move on. &#160;Later in the evening though (when it was still not even cool enough for a jacket, let alone a scarf,) things had cleared out and it was much more pleasant in not only Fado but the whole area in general. Drink and food is good. &#160;Good for gathering friends to watch game. &#160;However the waitress need to work harder on their tips. &#160; A lot of local, but not me. &#160;I'm a little disappointed about their service. &#160;I was there before the happy hour and sit thru the whole period. &#160; However, they charged me full price for those drinks that I order before the HH....Customer awareness is the key... To start off, I am currently on an antibiotic that makes me violently ill if I drink alcohol. &#160;So in another 10 or so days, I will be back to try the bar out.We were walking along 1st ave, just basically wandering around when we happened upon Fado's. &#160;It looked like a nice enough place so we popped in. &#160;One of the first things I saw was the canvas boat on the ceiling and I said let's try this place.It was nice enough place with friendly staff, basically you seat yourself. &#160;The food was good, I had the all day Irish Breakfast. &#160;The bangers were soft and juicy. &#160;The eggs were cooked over easy. &#160;But the ham, wow the ham was really good. &#160;I think that was the best part of the meal. &#160;Two slices of ham, juicy and flavorful. &#160;Too many times, I have had ham that is just loaded with salt, but not here. &#160;Can't wait to try them again, maybe try something on the dinner menu and then follow it up with some whiskey and beer. Fado is nice in a nouveau-yuppy pseudo Irish bar sort of way. They have good food and beer, and the staff is usually pretty nice. Well, about half the time. I've been here several times, and it's about 50% of the time that I leave happy, and 50% of the time that I leave so mad that I vow never to return. There are a lot of 50% Fado examples for me, so I'm officially coining my 50% Fado Rule. Fado tries to be a traditional Irish bar, and do have some good traditional menu items. Happy Hour isn't great though--usually only one beer is on special (the last time we went, it was Stella. How wrong is it that the special beer in an Irish "pub" is Stella??). The appetizers on happy hour special aren't anything special--fried green beans are at least interesting, but i feel like you could get their other selections (like hummus) anywhere. The meals are good and served quickly. I've had the Irish Breakfast, Fish &amp; Chips, Bacon Cheeseburger, all were delicious. The real draw for me is that Fado has Strongbow on tap. Mmm, Strongbow. Oh, and Newcastle on tap for my favorite beer, if I'm in the mood for beer. And, they do know how to pull a good pint of Guinness.The reason I've given them 3 stars only is because many nights I've tried to stop in, and they had every area reserved for private parties. Come on, reserving EVERY room for private parties except the small bar area on a FRIDAY night is just insane. Especially when an area is reserved for a party at 7pm, and it's already 8, and there's nobody in the private party who has shown up yet. I'm not in the restaurant or bar business, but it seems to me in those cases, a present and paying customer is better than a party that may or may not ever &#160;show up. Again with my 50% Fado rule--half the time we've tried to go, we're unable to because there's no space with all of the private reservations. If I could give Fado 2.5 stars, I would. Half the goodness gets half the stars in my mind. But I'll keep going there when the craving for a cider gets me, so perhaps 3 stars are best. Went here for a quick lunch. &#160;The corned beef sandwich hit the spot and I sub the fries for their slaw. &#160;Be sure to order extra horseradish mayo as they barely put any in your sandwich. &#160;OK food but higher priced than I would usually pay for lunch ($12 with tip here for just a lunch entree and water). The people at Fado are seriously nice. Like, reserve a table for you on a Friday night without a credit card nice. And the service is fast and the beer is nummy. What more could you want? I think it's the best place to play trivia on Wednesday night. &#160;The servers are very friendly. &#160;My only complaint is I wish they had more items on the menu. &#160;It's a great place to watch soccer also. St. Patrick's was insane here. &#160;I waited a good half hour to get in, and really didn't like paying $15, but it's a ploy to come back because they give you a $10 coupon to use at a later time. &#160;I could appreciate the long wait in hindsight because they carefully controlled the crowd size so that you could move somewhat comfortably. &#160;Nothing kills a mood faster than being totally crushed because the owner wanted to 'make a buck.' &#160;The Guinness was really good, people were totally decked out in green, and plenty of barely dressed ladies shaking their moneymakers. &#160;I'd come back for the party next year. Tintin was starving so we got the bangers and mash, brown bread ice cream, Irish coffee and a Stella. &#160;The portions of food and ice cream were enormous and good, particularly the brown bread ice cream. &#160;I wouldn't call it a destination spot but the spacious bar, the large menu and excellent service would draw me back if I were in the area. We come here at least once a week for happy hour and has been good to us. &#160;The staff is attentive to our drinking needs. &#160;The food is good...I've ordered from the happy hour menu and fish 'n' chips from the regular menu. Landed here by luck looking for something cool on a hot afternoon. Caught the happy hour and happy Seattle soccer team fan vibe. Good beer. Decent food. Excellent service. Kinda loud, in a cheerful way. Food is pub food. Recently went to Seattle for vacation with my wife. &#160;As soon as we got into town we asked the lady at the front desk where we could get a nice sandwich and a cold beer. &#160;She recommended the Fado Irish Pub. &#160;It ended up being a very nice choice.Going inside you notice all the wood furnishings that look like they just came out of a old catholic church. &#160;Nothing blasphemous so don't worry. &#160;The place actually looks and feels like a pub. &#160;Even the bartendars and servers wear all black clothing. What really stood out at this place was the service. &#160;Everyone was warm and friendly. &#160;Even the bartendar came by and chatted with us to see how we were doing.As for drinks we have few pints of local ale that was fantastic. &#160;For an appetizer we had fried green beans with fried banana peppers served with a sesame soy sauce. &#160;Real good. &#160;I ordered a corn beef sandwich for myself and my wife ordered a salad. &#160;My sandwich was awesome and my wife's salad was big. &#160;She really enjoyed it. &#160;Wash it down with good beer. &#160;It's all good.All in all this is a great place for lunch. &#160;The service is great. &#160;Food is great. &#160;Definitley a place I would come to again when I am in the Seattle area. I came here for a birthday party. My friends had reserved a private room which was really nice. &#160;It's a very lively and somewhat dark atmosphere. The food was good. &#160;We came on a night where they had a live band and we danced. &#160;If you're female, you'll probably get hit on. &#160;People that come here really know how to party. They really made up for bad service. Contacted me by email and phone. &#160;I haven't been back yet to try the fish and chips. Will update later. This Irish pub is more Irish-themed than truly Irish, but the food is good (if a bit untraditional), the beers are cold, and the dark wood furniture is homey and comfortable. &#160;The patrons of the bar are younger and louder than most places, so I don't recommend going to Fado for a quiet drink. &#160;Trivia night is fun but can be distracting if you're not interested in playing. Great whiskey BBQ chicken wings with blue cheese dressing; a little more pricey but that's what you get for touristy destinations. Overall fun atmosphere and I have to say it's someplace I try to go whenever I visit Seattle. It can get crowded so make sure on nights with live music you get your table and keep it! Great food, great service, reasonable prices all in a terrific atmosphere! Don't walk past this place without going in. Even if you don't eat, have a quick drink and just enjoy the place - you'll be glad you did. Love Love it! It is my favorite place to relax with a few beers, or dance the night away to live music. The Guinness Ice cream Brownie is heavenly! This is a great Irish bar centrally located in downtown seattle which makes it easy for everyone to find, but of course parking can be a nightmare. I do love the inside and find this is a great place to meet up with friends. It is of course super crowded on St Patricks Day and can look like a hurricane came through if you arrive late. I do enjoy the tiny outdoor area and the few tables on a sunny afternoon. My favorite thing of this bar is the make your own bloody mary bar, they give you a glass with vodka and you go to a table and set it up with all the fixings for about 8.50$. I cheat and go back to add more olives and things after I have drank some of the drink down. For some reason making my own drinks brings me great joy and I do seem to feel pretty happy after 1 or 2. Unfortunately the times for this varies, it seems to be on Sundays, but lately seems to be only Sundays when there are sports games going on at the nearby stadiums. Do check it out. Bloody Marys. Delicious! I will only order BM's here as I'm never disappointed. Stopped by at 7:45 on Sunday night of the holiday weekend. &#160;They seated us in the closed section as we had our nine year old with us. &#160;At first we thought they had forgotten about us, but once the waitress feed herself up, she took great care of us. &#160;Totally comfortable with our kid and eager to answer questions. &#160;Loved my corned beef and cabbage boxty. &#160;Never had a boxty before, and they're yummy. &#160;Husband liked his burger - but what can you do to a burger? &#160;While not kids menu to speak of, there are lots of items that will satisfy. &#160;Since I hate kids menus anyway (who needs another chicken nugget and macaroni and cheese?), I was happy to help her select from some possible choices. &#160;(Never mind the fact that she selected the chicken finger appetizer...) &#160;Shared a dessert of bread pudding with brown bread ice cream. &#160;YUM! &#160;You wouldn't know this was a chain - just doesn't have that feeling. &#160;Wooden menus are pretty cool too.
I went to Ocho on a Thursday. &#160;We (2 of us) were seated right away. &#160;The restaurant is very small and very dark. &#160;The food is definitely Spanish. &#160;Affordable. &#160;I probably would go back if I could get over how loud it was. &#160;It's like i was all worn out just trying to listen to my friend, who was sitting only 2 feet from me. &#160; The waitress was pleasant, not too chatty or clingy. &#160;All in all, it was OK. &#160;But what in the hell was up with those freaking girls laughing like shrill hyenas? &#160;Sometimes a place is too cozy for comfort. not at all familiar w/ballard...last time i was there, my man and i ate at oaxaca about a year and a half ago. drove by it three times unknowingly and finally just parked and walked around to find the spot. luckily, a kind ballard resident gave us directions and we were about to walk by it and she pointed out it was right there behind us! i thought it was part of azteca and didn't bother to investigate that corner more. so thank you kind lady, who ever you are! :)so, we tried the the deviled eggs (good, capers made it better), the lomo-cured thin pieces of pork w/ cheese and toast &#160;(wonderful &amp; simple, my fave one), patatas bravas (very tasty, dip it in both sauces to make em even more tastier!), chorizo dish w/fried egg and potatoes (so-so, nothing out of the ordinary), three amigos-prawn w/a clam on top of a fried risotta ball (eh, so-so again. eat the risotto w/the red peppers it comes w/ to give it flavor), fabada- white bean stew w/kale and pieces of toast (ADD chorizo! and soak up soup w/toast. tasty!), la carolina- dates w/goat cheese &amp; wrapped in pancetta (interesting blend of flavors...i could only eat one &amp; a half) and the dark chocolate spread on toast w/truffle oil and crushed almonds (i couldn't get pass the smell -didn't know what it was but i forced myself to eat this). he drank an estrella beer (which went soooo good w/everything we ate!) &amp; he ordered a blue moon beer for me after the sangria blanco which i couldn't drink &#160;(thought it would be sweet but nope).we very much enjoyed our time there; i love how it is a small restaurant, very cozy. only can sit about 32 people (see! it was such a small spot that i could count the seats in my head!!!). our waitress was awesome. we spent a good two hours in there, taking our time drinking and ordering tapas. &#160;three stars for the food and an extra one for the ambiance &amp; my man's company. Yummy! &#160;Great bites, great wine! &#160;Downside-it's teeny tiny. &#160;But it is worth the wait and it seems that traffic moves in and out pretty good. &#160;I have been three times now and will be going back!! I had seen all the rave reviews on Yelp for Ocho so I decided to check it out. &#160;I had also heard rumors that they were somehow affiliated to Oaxaca, which is one of my favorites in Seattle so I had very high expectations. &#160;I was not disappointed. &#160;We went early on a Friday evening, they said the wait was about 30 min and that they would call my cellphone when a table was ready. &#160;This place is tiny, it used to be a hot dog joint. &#160;Sure enough, about 30 min later they called my cell and we walked back to grab our table. &#160;Ocho is tapas style and from what I can tell has an ever changing menu (which consisted of a chalkboard on the wall). &#160;We ate about 6 different tapas - almonds, manchengo cheese, olives, beet salad and a few others that I can't remember due to the $10 margarita. &#160;It is a great spot for a date and for all you foodies. &#160;It definitely reminded me of some of the places I had visited in Barcelona. &#160;I wouldn't recommend it for large parties, just because it is small. &#160;Come prepared for a wait and you wont be disappointed. &#160;Stop in, give them your name and plan on walking to somewhere less crowded for a cocktail prior and you'll be in good shape. I'll probably have my hands bound by a roll of name tags at the next elite event for typing this...but, this is not really the best place for dinner. Now, before you get all pissed off and start clicking "just a note" please, understand that I do think this is an absolutely fantastic spot to enjoy tapas paired with some wine and/or cocktails. The prices are cheap, the portions are satisfying in their diminutive state, the menu is long, but the ingredient list is limited making it tough to suss out a well rounded meal for yourself, but fantastic for picking out a couple (a couple a dozen, in my case) snacks for yourself. Definitely try the blue cheese stuffed dates with the bacon wrapped around them. Delicious! The deviled eggs were complex and flavorful, the chorizo and eggs were greasy and every bit as tasty as it sounds. For dessert, just stick to the manchego with quince paste, or order back up another round of the blue cheese stuffed dates. We tried the melted truffle oil chocolate on toasted baguette and left 83% of it on the table. Blech. The restaurant itself is warm and cozy, but the noise level borders on earplug worthy. The loud music and the din of the restaurant is helpful to drown out the folks who are seated right next to you at the banquette seating (which might as well be communal) but you can't even hear your dining companion on the other side of the oddly narrow rough hewn table.Ocho is also great for those who just want a liquid dinner! One "Ten Dollar Margarita" contains everything you need and is like a slimfast for boozehounds. ocho represents the reason that i moved to ballard. &#160;(i'd wanted to move back in 2002, but couldn't swing the mortgage...and now, sadly, a chunk of ballard seems overstylized)ocho has superb tapas - each bite was a culinary explosion...and they have a chalkboard menu, which means the selections are always changing...providing more incentive to go back, and back again. &#160;i also thoroughly enjoyed the fantastic music, genuine service &amp; generous pours. &#160;the atmosphere is intimate &amp; cozy, which hopefully, will keep it from being a generic place to be seen. Uno: # of "Ten Dollar Margarita"s to make you feel good.Dos: # of times our waitress asked if I wanted another TDM.Tres: $ cost of the "hongos al Jerez" - delicious sherry &amp; mushroom dish on crostini.Cuatro: # of shrimp you get in the $6 Garlic Prawn dish.Cinco: x 1000. # of "pan con chocolate" I could eat in one sitting.Seis: $ The highest amount you'll pay for a tapa here.Siete: Put them together and what do you have?Ocho. Ocho is a little confusing for me. I'm not giving Ocho a 4-star rating for food. But, Ocho represents some kind of spirit or effort on the part of the staff that I don't really see at other restaurants.Ocho is going for something bold. It offers fairly complex tapas at very reasonable prices. But, the execution isn't quite there. We had a good 6 dishes and the quality ranged from excellent (artichoke hearts) to overly salty (fataba). Nonetheless, Ocho still gets 4 stars.The food can be either salty or excellent. The drinks aren't delicious, but boozy. And the staff is overworked, but willing to bend over backwards to make you happy.I have to say that Ocho is all about effort in making the guest pleased and I really respect that. I think its very possible to have an excellent meal here (and I did), but I can also see that some might be more interested in something a little more refined or consistent. Great little spot. &#160;Tough to beat as a fine option to connect with a friend or a quick stop off on the way home from work.Plenty of good options on the food end of things... cheap and reasonable. &#160;Decent options for libation as well. &#160;One of the top lil joints in Ballard This five star rating is for the food + affordability combo. &#160;Went here last Saturday late night with two girlfriends and we were able to score a spot at the bar within an unheard of five minutes (at this point I was already a convert from any other overpriced Seattle tapas joint). &#160;I immediately locked eyes with the bartender ordered up the "infamous" 10 bones Margarita and orders of chorizo and potato, patatas bravas, dates and blue cheese with prosciutto, and this sauteed mushroom toast.UPDATE 3/12: So I went again last night and this time the board was crammed with options. &#160;This is one of those dream come true for my palate, but nightmare from hell for my thighs! &#160;Luckily my dining partner was not ravenous so he stopped me from the blowout. &#160;Tried the red sangria and it was no dice....stick with the white! &#160;The white anchovy with the fried artichoke was a nice little pop and the gambas was delish. &#160;I love that this time they supplied us with more buttery bread in order to sop up the shrimp and clam sauces that were left behind. &#160;I was also given the option of an off the menu Madeira that was golden raisin-y goodness....Yep...they make you feel REAL special at Ocho...especially when you almost shut the place down!Honest to God, the Margarita was mediocre at best....the only disappointment of the night. &#160;Our table also ordered the mussels and the beets with blue cheese. &#160;Everything was either amazing (see Beets, Dates, and Mushroom Toast) to super tasty.After my Margarita disaster I went on to the White Sangria and it definitely saved the day!Go white Sangria folks and make sure to order anything with blue cheese or sauteed mushrooms!Also the five stars include the decor and ambiance in this place. &#160;The music is not loud and you can actually have a conversation (novel thought I know). &#160;I would love to sit at the banquette that runs along the left wall next time I go and stay for a spell. The food was good, the drinks were great and the vibe was spot on. &#160;This is a nice place to meet up with a few good friends and just relax. Business is booming, or at least that's what it seems to those who live within walking distance. &#160;While it's great for Ocho, those of us who like to hang out in our 'hood and support local business have had a hard time getting in the door. &#160;My husband and I did secure a spot early on a recent Thursday evening:The food = 4 starsthe atmosphere &amp; location = 5 (they really did a great job)The wait (for a table &amp; food) = 2 starsThe "cool kids" atmosphere = 1 starMaybe when the buzz dies down we'll go back and I'll up the rating. I love this place soooo much. &#160;I think the food is delicioso, inventive but not trying to reinvent. &#160;I appreciate it because I go to Spain a lot and I think it is the closest to the real thing in town. &#160;Plus the owners are super adorable and they have kick ass margaritas! &#160;They even have Estrella beer..I'm home! &#160;My only request is maybe turn down the music a squish as when you sit by the speakers by the doors it's really hard to talk. &#160;Thats it. Fui con mis amigos aqui. (I went here with my friends! They were skeptical cause they thought Ocho was the new bar area of Azteca since it's right next door. Luckily it is not. I really like the stained glass sign above Ocho's entrance.)El lugar estaba lleno de gente y ruidosos. (This place is really crowded and LOUD! Probably because it's so tiny!)Pero con buena musica.(But... at least the music was good. Whoever's iPod mix was playing was heavy on dark oldies and electro.) Las placas fueron demasiado pequenos, pero sabrosos. (It was hard to read the menu cause it's all cramped onto one big chalkboard on the back wall. I thought the small plates were TOO small. Like, the $6 prawn plate only had 4 prawns.. lame... but I have to say it was very tasty.)Me absorbe mucho tequila cuando bebi la margarita. No cuesta diez dolares, pero vale la pena.(I had to try the infamous Ten Dollar Margarita and it has soooo much tequila in it! It's worth the price! If you drank two of these in one night you'd probably just be done.) Me gusta este lugar.(I like this place!!!!!!!!!)Sorry, I just wanted to show off the Espanol skillz I garnered from Seattle Central's distance learning language program. I can only semi-read and write Spanish. Never speak it to me cause I'll have no idea and feel embarrassed. So here's the thing, right? Yeah, it's not authentic Spanish tapas, but maybe that's ok. Because sometimes authentic food tastes like poo. Like you have this fantastic memory of sitting in the plaza, watching the sunset, drinking sangrias and admiring the senoritas, and you remember that little Spanish omelet as being some great new taste sensation, but really, you were just starving and couldn't tell it was just undercooked "I Can't Believe It's Not Huevos!" because you had been tossing and turning all night on your hostel bed of nails while your bunk mate "gave American lessons" to the bearded East German backpacker chick not 2 feet above your head, only to have the joy of a cold morning shower on a floor covered in algae followed by a breakfast of bread and little butter packets you were able to swipe from the outdoor tables at the nearest tourist trap restaurant. So then you stumble on Ocho. &#160;And it sounds Spanish. &#160;And it looks European. &#160;And from your "Europe Through The Backdoor" experience that you shared with all the other Americans, you fancy yourself very knowledgeable about all things authentic. But you're shocked SHOCKED! that the chef has taken liberties with the authenticity of the Spanish menu. &#160;Well compadre? Stamp your little zapatos in a huff on down to un otro restaurante and leave more room for me at Ocho. Yes yes yes! Thank you darling ex La Carta bartender for making the best 'ritas in town and realizing your potential and having the balls to open an adorable intimate place in Ballard where adorable and intimate are not hard to come by. The vibe is perfection. The waitstaff is impeccable (this includes the owner who cooks, tends bar and schmoozes). The playlist is worth noting, and copying. The menu has all of my favorite ingredients and prices that make my wallet smile, and the 10 dollar margaritas knocked my socks off, although I wish I had been cut off at numero uno :)I don't think you'll need it, but good look to you, you shaggy haired entrepreneur! Ocho is a solid addition to the Ballard dining scene and a good alternative to the long lines at La Carta. We ordered the shrimp -- amazing, these little toasties with melted manchego and tomato jam, mussels, and the chorizo + potato + fried egg. The egg came runny, which was ideal. I think the mussels were a little salty. However it was the atmosphere - great music, a great bartender and great service that really made it a fun place to be. Notably we went in at 9:30 on a Weds so we missed the bulk of the crowds - with the small location it could easily fill up quickly. The only negative is that depending on where you sit the corner traffic lights can be seen too much and be a little distracting. 5 stars for saving me the trip out to Harvest Vine. &#160;Hometown love, people.I will have to work my way thru the menu one more time on our next visit, so that I can accurately report on the favorite dishes... &#160;but I can say that everything I have sampled so far is DEEE-LICIOUS.Thanks guys, and continued success. &#160;GO BALLARD! Como se dice en Ingls? &#160; Mucho mucho mucho con gusto!After reading all the good yelps this place was getting, my friend Megan took her sister and her espanish spaniard to this place the day before and gave rave reviews as well.. &#160; Immediately, I felt I had to go myself to check it out.Loved the sangria blanca, the eggs/potato/chorizo and the papas! &#160;I am definitely going back!!Why is Ballard gettin so hot! Sometimes I feel like people give a new restaurant in a cool neighborhood 5 stars because it's a new restaurant in a cool neighborhood. This place has average food at an affordable price. Although I can't say I tried every dish, what we ordered was not that memorable, but certainly not horrible. The garlic shrimp was pretty tasty, the beets uninspiring. The sangria (red) was good. It's small and very loud. But that could've been because there was a group of young women next to our oh-so-close tables, screeching loud with laughter, high pitched voices, and "oh my gods". I wish I'd been Darryl Hannah in that movie Splash so I could have made their eardrums bleed, as they did mine. Teeny tiny space with a whole lot of personality. This corner spot in Ballard is the perfect place to have drinks and sample a ton of small plates. Two of my favorites were the garlic shrimp and white bean soup. The entire menu is written up on a chalk board (which can be hard to read), and adds a very "homey" feeling to the restaurant. The $10 margarita is worth every penny...strong yet delicious! I think I said 'Oh my god' ten times by the end of our first small plate. The pancetta-wrapped bleu stuffed dates were the best I've ever had. The drinks are imaginative and strong. The food is divine. We had five tapas to share, and each was better than the last. My favorites- the sherried mushrooms piled high and spicy on toast, and the chorizo la mancha- with egg and some sublime potatoes with garlicky something amazing on them. Dessert- chocolate toast with fleur de sel and truffle oil?! Come ON! Can you believe it?? I couldn't, either. Incredible though it was, this is the one thing I would have toned down. I mean, thank you for the generosity with the truffle oil, but my taste is just to have a suggestion of it, and not to taste it. That said- that's my one single solitary bone to pick with the place. Fabulous! Also- within the first five minutes I was sold- Willie Nelson in my ears, Will the bartender in my eyes, my purse on a hook under the bar, and a delicious cocktail with fresh blueberries in my mouth. Beware- the place is tiny. Go early. We tried this place on a random week night, after reading and hearing great things. &#160;The second that we walked in the vibe was very welcoming and mellow. &#160;The food was awesome and so original, unlike anything I have had before. &#160;The sangria tasted just alright, but after two glasses I had forgotten about the less than great day I had at work. &#160;All together a pleasant and memorable experience. Ocho is a pleasant way to get your tapas fix in the heart of Ballard. The place is tiny, but we walked in a got seated immediately at 7pm on a Saturday, so I'm guessing that there's rarely a wait. Yep, it's loud and just a smidge overpriced, but the food is tasty (albeit slightly small portions, even for tapas), the atmosphere is friendly, and the wait staff is wonderfully helpful. We came for the delicious drinks and we'll come back because the food and atmosphere are spot-on at Ocho. Don't be fooled by the seemingly "cheap" small plates. They add up. And when you taste the first bite and then it's gone, you have no choice but to order another of the same. Sangria is awesome but watch out, the Brandy will put you on your a$$. The music was great! The owners were cool and they finally have a sign (although it really doesn't make much difference- if you don't know where you're going, you can easily miss ocho). Super cute place with the perfect amount of seats. They have a very yummy $5 white wine by the glass. They have a white and red sangria, both are wonderful. All the food I've tried so far has been &#160;really good. My favorite "to die for" indulgence are the stuffed dates. This is an indulgence in taste and price because they are giant dates stuffed with blue cheese and wrapped with ham for $5 but you only get three and I could eat 20. I just wish they had a menu with better descriptions or pictures because I am not familiar with spanish tapas or their portions. The cocktail servers are a super sweet bunch. My husband loves loves this place. We stopped in on their opening week and were very pleasantly surprised. The staff were super duper friendly (we sat at the bar), as were the other diners (it's a small place - be prepared to get cozy with your neighbors).I thought the food was great. Admittedly, I have never been to Spain, so the people who complained about inauthenticity could be right, but the food is still very tasty. The portions are quite large for tapas (I think we ate 4 or 5 dishes plus olives/nuts and were totally satisfied between the two of us). I actually thought the place they fell short was on the drinks. Their sangria is NOT sangria, people. Sangria is a wine punch - wine is the primary ingredient, fruit is soaked in a small amount of liquor or liqueur, and I can even accept that some people add soda water (hey, I like fizz as much as the next gal). A glass of brandy with some limes and maraschino cherries (!!!) topped with a splash of wine is not sangria. It is maybe a sangria inspired cocktail. And it's not BAD, per se (although, I'm not a huge lover of brandy, so it wasn't my favorite). But it is straight up not sangria. So there. The $10 margarita is decent (it's not sweetened, so be aware of that) - I actually prefer a leeeeeetle bit of sweetener in my marg, but the tequila was tasty and it was definitely bang for your buck. If I order it again, I might ask for it to be topped with a splash of OJ to sweeten it up a bit without making it too sugary. Okay, that was kind of ranty, but overall this place is top notch. I'm giving it four stars for now, because of the aforementioned drink issue and because I'd like to visit one more time to make sure they keep their momentum going. It's quite possible I'll upgrade them to 5-stars in the near future. Mmm. &#160;Who doesn't love good small bites and strong drinks right after work on a Friday? &#160;We stopped in around 6:15 and grabbed the last two seats in the place. &#160;The only reason Ocho's getting 4 and not 5 stars is because the service was a bit spotty - but that's okay. &#160;Our two drink/two plate event took close to an hour. &#160;The $10 Margarita IS what everyone has been raving about. &#160;Boyfriend has been talking about it ever since. &#160;I had the sangria - also delicious and deceptively potent. &#160;By the time we left, the place was jammed and those standing were turning into rabid seat-hunters. &#160;That kind of turned me off - but we'll probably end up going there on dead nights from here on out. Ocho, Ballard loves you. Our experience was good. &#160;The staff was great and very happy. &#160;I didn't get that too cool for school attitude that I encounter when i drink and eat in my nieghborhood of ballard.The food was good, small plate tapas stuff. &#160;The mushrooms were fantastic. &#160;But the dish with a shrimp, chorizo and clam atop saffron rissotto need a little work. &#160;The shrimp was obviously frozen and had a terrible texture, tough and chewy. &#160;The clam was really fishy and tainted the rest of the dish with a pungent fish essence. &#160;however the chorizo was absolutely fantastic.The drinks were great and I enjoyed the atmosphere. &#160;All in all a nice little addition to the ever changing ballard scene. OK maybe we are going to get bad press for this. But this place was a real disappointment. Maybe since we went to Txori last week. Anyway, First of all the staff was pleasant. The bar tender...not so much, since we sat at his bar, we thought maybe he should greet us, maybe say hi, we watched him the whole time cleaning the bar and washing dishes. We came here on a Thursday, It wasn't very &#160;busy, but the staff seemed a little cold. I was hoping to report that the food was good. but it was bad. Everything was super salty. The wrapped dates were undercooked and were a large disappointment. I had a mixed drink, it was suppose to be a sangria type hard liquor, but it was horrible, for nine dollars.....was an extreme let down. I didn't even finish a quarter of it. The bar tender took it from me when we paid, I guess he didn't even realize I barely touched the only drink he made for us. Maybe we came on an off night. But we wont be back. So cute, so fantastic. &#160; Go early and you can get a table without waiting. &#160;The place is sooooo tiny, tables so tiny, food so tiny. &#160;Make sure to order doubles, esp if you have more than 2 ppl.The mushroom/toast dish is heaven. &#160;So are the figs stuffed with blue cheese and ham.$10 margarita is the booziest ever. &#160;They'll top you up with some mixer after you take a couple sips if you can't hang.I would like to see them get more creative with the dessert selection. &#160;The toast with chocolate and sea salt sounded really good, but was just ok. Well frankly I'm glad I'm reviewer #39 because the rest of you fools just saved me 10 minutes of my evening.I enjoyed nearly every second of this restaurant. &#160;Sexy, beautiful atmosphere and staff (me-OW). &#160;Stiff drinks where you truly do get every cent's worth. &#160;Large inexpensive menu for such a cozy kitchen. &#160;Between my two companions and myself, we shared 6 dishes and each one had us dissecting its flavors with almost all of our senses. &#160;All dishes range between $5-8, so order a bit of everything.One star off only because of the menu itself-- quaint in its chalkboard style hung upon an enormous wall, but excruciating to the eye if you are any less than 20/20 vision or seated more than three tables back... you'll be cursing that you forgot you glasses or you will simply resort to being that fool who must stand in the narrow pathway as you scour the options. Lo siento. 6 of us comfortably crammed into a 4 person table and proceeded to order almost everything on the menu. Not a single thing was left on the plates, and not many complaints around the table. The bill came to just over $120, and 4 of the 6 of us were drinking also. My personal favorites were the egg/chorizo/potato plate, the white bean stew, mushroom toast, beet salad.... heck everything I tried was awesome! The server was very sweet, and the bartender brought over a sample of the sangria blanca, tasty!The only thing I would advise against is the "Death in the Afternoon" cocktail. Someone at our table ordered it, and we all passed it around. VERY bitter!The place is SUPER small, so I would suggest going on off hours during the week. After reading all the reviews on Yelp I decided to try Ocho. &#160;My husband and I got here right at 5pm after rushing here from work on Friday. &#160;I knew ahead of time (based on what I read) that Ocho was small so I wanted to make sure I got a seat before the place got packed with people. &#160;We got there just in time. &#160;The place was full but luckily there were two seats available at the bar. &#160;We snagged those seats with the quickness. I usually would not prefer to sit at the bar but in this case I'm glad I did. &#160;The menu is on a chalkboard right next to the bar and was within eyesight of our seats. &#160;I could not imagine sitting at the tables and being able to see the chalkboard from those vantage points. Since we were at the bar, the bartender took our orders. I started off by ordering the refreshing Sagrada Familia which I liked very much. We then ordered 5 dishes: the Deviled Egg, the Clams, the Garlic Shrimp, the Chorizo and the Halibut. &#160;All were tasty but I loved the Garlic Shrimp, the Clams and the Chorizo. &#160;I would definitely order these dishes again. &#160;After finishing our meals, I decided to order another drink and opted for the $10 Margarita. &#160;It definitely was a good ending to my meal here. &#160;Considering the crowd, the service was very prompt and the bartender was very attentive and friendly. OMG! &#160;I work down the street from this cute little tapas/cocktail bar...poof it was open and poof it was packed! &#160;With great reason!!! &#160;ALL of the food was perfect and delish. &#160;The beet salad was crunchy and yummy and wonderfully fresh. &#160;Well, from what I can remember. &#160;I had a couple of their $10 margaritas. &#160;Smooooooth. &#160;Strong. &#160;And never should be consumed in mass quantities!I hate to say go because I am afraid that means that I will never get a seat again. &#160;But GO! GO! GO! "Let's try Ocho," I said, "And we'll only get some tapas. Or even just one; not even tapas. Only a tapa."It's what I intended, honestly and truly, but after looking over the menu we couldn't try just one. We tried five different things and each one was wonderful. The stuffed dates especially were delicious. "I don't like dates," I had protested. Only to be proven wrong. They're delicious.I also had a glass of sangia (of the red variety, for authenticity). Not as good as sangria in Spain- which I suppose is a given- or even as good as sangria from Tango, which is where I always go for sangria, but good none-the-less.The staff were very friendly and very attentive.As we were leaving, the bartender said he'll see us next time, and he definitely will because everything was very yummy. It's definitely not Spain, but hey, that's not what I'm expecting. I'll go back to Spain for that. But as a tide-over until I have the time and money to go back to Europe? Definitely a winner. I'll be back for sure.Edit: I have now been back to Ocho twice more and have not been disappointed either time. I have spent a goodly amount of time talking to Zak and Gelsey (the owners) and also Will, the bartender. Gelsey remembers me by name when I come in and is very sweet. Zak I think is less enthusiastic, but he may just be bitter because I told him all the sangrias I ever had in Spain were sweeter and almost spit herbal infused vodka all over him. As to the vodka, I couldn't help it. I didn't know what was being handed to me and it certainly wasn't what I expected or wanted. The next couple of minutes spent downing my drink and licking my napkin probably didn't endear me to him either... Awesome spot for a date or just 2 friends out to have a couple of drinks and some tapas. &#160;The Ten Dollar Margarita is worth the dough and the some of the food is so rich taht it's hard to even finish the little servings... &#160;The best part is that each app is between $3-$6 and is small enough that you can easily share 6-7 between 2 people. &#160;Intimate, good service, fair prices. &#160;Check it out!
By far the best Philly's around..
Your basic sandwich shop deli that seem to have gone away. You know square loaves of bread and lots of good fresh items on top. Nice list or have them make it how you like it. Super quick, decent priced. Much better than Subway unless you have to have sub shaped bread.
I just saw a review filter in for this place and remembered I'd never updated my review to reflect the one star it truly deserves. The food here is flat-out terrible. I revisited twice after my initial rather abysmal visit, which I tried to chalk up to new-venue mishaps. But one of the two times I visited, we ordered about six items from their happy hour menu and some of them were actually *still frozen* when served.I left that meal convinced that there's no worse food in the city, and since then have wondered how they're subsidizing their survival. Since they're frequently advertising Groupons and other discounts, do take note of how many one- and two-star reviews are in here, and of those reviews which are less damning, you will likely find the patrons are fond of the band or the karaoke, and haven't partaken of the food.This food is several rungs below Denny's; I would actually accept microwaved frozen food if it were cooked all the way through and not awful to begin with. But as another reviewer wrote, this is the kind of thing where you worry about getting sick afterward. I generally don't care much at all about service, but this place was so extraordinarily bad I had to comment. It was on a Friday evening and it wasn't overly packed yet. I joined a few friends at a table and was not approached for service for a good 5-10 minutes. Once the waitress finally got our orders, 2 simple beers and a vodka-cran, it took over 20 minutes for her to return with 2 warm beers. Of course she didn't even bring the 3rd drink and said it was "coming".15 minutes later it came, and was the wrong drink. She definitely didn't care at all. She also didn't bother to ask a new arrival at our table if they wanted anything. So awful.... &#160; &#160;They were also setting up some sort of lame event with a $10 cover charge for guys only. Awful awful awful. Don't bother. Came here Monday for cheap drinks and food before doing karaoke next door.Okay service, drinks and food quality. Low prices. I haven't been to The Scarlet Tree since the old location burned down. &#160;Our visit today was a nice surprise - great Happy Hour and the best restaurant meatloaf sliders I've ever had. &#160;Almost as good as my Mom'd meatloaf.4 stars instead of 5 because the service is really slow. I and my cousins came here for brunch and I think it was pretty good.They had nice kid service.I had eggs scrambled with apple sauce and it was really good. The baked potato was awesome. But the scone was hard. Went for happy hour.Service was fine, but the food is overpriced - even with the happy hour discount. &#160;What I had: beer, fried pickles, quesadilla. &#160;I think the quesadilla is normally 9 bucks, which is way too much for a quarter of a tortilla and some pico de gallo and sour cream.Fried pickles were way to salty.Beer price seemed high for happy hour, also.Not impressed. Went here for the first time last Friday night for Happy Hour/Dinner. &#160;It was too hot to cook at home &amp; I was tired from working all day. &#160;Hubby had been there before with friends of his. &#160;Unfortunately they don't have air conditioning. &#160;We were quite warm in there. &#160;:( Cheap happy hour bevvies helped ease our discomfort. &#160;So did the wonderful food. &#160;We were so hungry we couldn't decide what to get. &#160;We started with the Mediterranean appie plate. &#160;It was wonderful. &#160;2 good size dollops of hummus, feta cheese, kalamata olives, roasted red bell peppers, cucumber slices &amp; plenty of pita wedges. &#160;I wish they would have had a Greek salad on the menu to eat after that greek teaser. &#160;We thought maybe the lamb burger would be a good follower but they were out of lamb that night. &#160;:( Instead we settled on Cobb Salad for hubby &amp; I had the meatloaf sliders. &#160;The Cobb Salad was beatutiful. &#160;I'll get that next time. &#160;My meatloaf sliders were surprisingly filling for only being 2. &#160;They were served with a small wild greens salad with balsamic dressing. &#160;Way too many onions on it though. &#160;The happy hour onion rings were just okay. &#160;They did taste like an out of a frozen bag appetizer. was here for a going away party. nice owner and cool bartenders. digging the the outside seating too during epic heatwave.
Food is terribleAmbiance is OKService is goodIn simple words do not come here Please don't buy the Groupon that's advertised today. &#160;Save yourself the disappointment. &#160;I feel like anyone who gave a great review of this place is either lying or didn't eat there.The only reason we went is because I had some old deal from Tippr that was about to expire. &#160;I've been here before and it wasn't that bad which is why I bought that deal - I was willing to give it another shot.Hate to write a bad review but everything about our short experience there was just...bad. &#160;When we got there, we saw at least three dirty tables with plates - gross. &#160;At first we thought they were short-staffed and then we noticed there was another server but she was busy flirting with a group of middle-aged dudes at the bar... &#160;C'mon, girl - turn your tables first. &#160;Then when she finally came around, she muttered something about being sorry and that she was covering - whatever she said was really confusing...Crappy service would have been OK if the food was up to par. &#160;The bf got meatloaf sliders and asked for fries with it - at the end, she charged us $6 for the fries alone. :-| &#160;I got the ahi tacos which were miserable - as much as I hate Joey's, theirs are actually worth braving the meat market there. &#160;He told me to stop eating the tuna out of fear that I'd actually get sick. &#160;Later when I asked him about the sliders, he said he was queasy just thinking about them...poor guy.Anyways, don't go here if you're hungry and plan to eat. &#160;I don't see how they can screw up a cocktail or beer...right? Meh, not a fan... These guys are always under staffed on Fridays during HH, specially those Fridays that are the last day for people to use their Groupons..The female bartenders are always overwhelmed and in a terrible mood when the place is packed.The appetizers are mediocre and the service is way too slooow. The food during brunch is OK but nothing special.If you are around that area and see The Scarlet Tree, keep on moving and go to Casa Patron right next to it! Went in for a drink with a friend, &#160;The place is nice and has been around for a while. The night we went there the heater was busted. I understand that if you can make a few bucks go ahead and do so, but maybe get some heaters on cold days to help keep the few clients you have warm.The drinks were nice, the service was very good and cordial.That last part will make me come back. My husband and I came here for brunch and had a nice time. It was our second visit with the first being for a dinner. Our server was pleasant and efficient and the restaurant was pretty quiet (though it was Mother's Day). I got the crab and mushroom omelet and it was pretty tasty. It came with their house potatoes but also a scone, which I find kind of strange because of the double carb whammy, but I won't complain because their scones are amazing. My husband got the corned beef benedict with potatoes. He said his potatoes seemed like they had been sitting out for quite a while, and the corned beef was chewy, but the hollandaise was good. My mimosa was nice though you could tell the champagne was cheap.We have yet to see the place busy, but I think the platform section is cool and it seems like the patio would be nice to people watch. The food is decent but we've also used online coupons both times. Our first trip here was not so impressive. &#160;We came with a living social deal for dinner. &#160;First, they seemed to be understaffed because we couldn't figure out if there was a waitress at all for the first 10 minutes. &#160;The ambiance was "dirty bar," rather than the trendy restaurant I was expecting.We ended up getting a $10 lamb burger and crab artichoke dip, which together already used up the living social deal. &#160;The burger was burned on the outside, but the greek sauce they used to cover that up was pretty decent. &#160;The crab dip came out as a pile of mush on a plate... not incredibly appealing, but it was pretty tasty. &#160;I am just happy we didn't have to pay the full price for that food.I also was here for breakfast one morning and it seemed like a whole different place. &#160;The music was pleasant and relaxing and the food was cooked well. &#160;I was surprised that I liked it all, and for ~$6 per person, not a deal breaker. &#160;Maybe I would return for more breakfast here, if at all. This place has been around for AGES!!!! I knew the address and location sounded vary familiar when I google mapped the place for the event we were attending:)My review is based on the Love Jones Experience event that was held at the Scarlet Tree. The venue itself turned out to be a little too small but hey that's a good thing for our friend who promoted the event. Walking in to the place was a little euphoric as I remember coming here back in the 90's lol'! The place has been updated very nicely, modern yet chic, I would say? Our seat were upstairs so I didn't get wander about much but what I saw of the place was nicely done.As far as the service I am not going to be harsh as the place was packed to capacity and will a $3 well drink special and $5 henn shots, I knew it's going to be slow, PLUS we were a party of 9! Drinks were delicious and so was the food and we pretty much ordered everything off the menu. I tried quite a few dishes and were pleasantly pleased.I'm excited to visit again as I am very interested in the calendar of events this venue promotes! Yay for Scarlet Tree and the nu flavor it's bringing to the 206:) I've been here twice and both times the servers seemed that they could care less that we were there. When I was there for brunch I had to hunt a server down to bring us some jam for the biscuits. Plus, the serve put us at a table that clearly wasn't going to fit all of our plates of food. Instead of trouble shooting the situation for us, I had to suggest to her to bring over an extra table so we could all fit. &#160;The second time we went for happy hour. No one greeted me even though a bunch of wait staff were huddled near the bar. I had to ask for menus and they had whited out most of their happy hour menu. My friend and I left and walked up to Pies and Pints where there was great food and even greater service. It's clear when people are really appreciative of your business and when they could care less. Love coming to this place on Tuesday nights for Karaoke. The bartenders are very friendly, the Karaoke host is a gem, and the food is good too (artichoke dip... mmmm). It's not your typical karaoke atmosphere. Not crowded, usually only 5-7 song wait, and great song selection. Some of the singers - not so great, but hey, that's what it's all about! I definitely would recommend a Tuesday night at Scarlet tree. Haven't been to Scarlet Tree otherwise, so can't comment on the 'normal' scene. My experiences have been that the food is alright, but the service is painfully bad! &#160;We have gone for brunch on Sunday 3 times... each time the hostess has acted like she has never hosted a restaurant before and is dressed such that since she barely asks how many are in your party, you're not even sure she works there. &#160;Otherwise, one of the servers is decent and the rest seem confused and overwhelmed. &#160;Once we were seated upstairs and it took at least 15 minutes before they asked if we wanted coffee... obviously we had time to memorize the menu so we ordered a well and they were out of all sorts of things. &#160;It took another 10 minutes to get the coffee and still another 10-15 minutes to get our food. &#160;I have written it off. &#160;I really want to like it because it's cute and close to my bf's apartment, but the service is just so bad...We went for drinks a couple of times and that was ok, but we still had to go to the bar and order ourselves.Come on Scarlet Tree, read your reviews and pull it together!! It's funny how places will slot themselves in your life. The Barber down the block, a gym across the street from work and in this case.. The bar located directly across the street from my bus stop. How can I resist?For a reincarnation, this place is cool. It's great that they're putting the same emphasis on live music as the original venue. &#160;The have something going on every night if the week be it live music, DJ or karaoke. It's definitely representing the original spirit of it's now ashen past. &#160;Okay, if you're wondering at this point: the original location burned down a few years ago. It was a legendary spot. Happy hour is my time at the Tree.. Good prices on the apps and a small, sturdy selection of beers. They even brought in my favorite brew (Elliot Bay Alembic Organic) after we requested it one evening. That alone earns a star in my book. Food is good, although I've only experienced the happy hour menu. Still, they have a decent selection of sliders, wings etc. &#160;Honestly, I'm primarily interested in the bar area and would probably elect for a more dinner oriented joint for a serious meal. But hey, that's Just me. To sum it up.. Scarlett Tree is a fantastic watering hole with good ambiance and a great staff. Had breakfast here today. &#160;Not nearly as good as last time (and what I wanted was no longer on the menu). &#160;But it was still decent food. &#160;I had the California omelet. &#160;Service was a bit slow, and the waitress apologized when she brought our check, saying they were swamped (which was obvious), and a Groupon-type coupon was bringing in more customers than usual. &#160;(We were there with such a coupon.). &#160;All in all, it was a lovely fall morning, the food was decent, and we were in and out in an hour, despite some slow service. While I don't really care for the interior, black chairs and tables in a dark room, I really loved the food. &#160;When asked if they could accommodate a vegan in making a sandwich not on the menu, the server was wonderfully compliant. &#160;In fact they made a quinoa sandwich that was delicious!!!!!! &#160;I love places that are so easy they can make exactly what you want even when it's not specifically listed on the menu. &#160;Our server was friendly and charming. Save your time-- poor service, and poor to midland food. &#160;Allow me to elaborate.A friend of mine had a Groupon for the Scarlet Tree, and we finally decided to use it. &#160;Our server (the only one on the floor) rarely visited, and when we did, she'd take our drink order and we never saw our drinks-- we didn't get charged for them, so I'm assuming she just forgot, but write it down! &#160;I can understand if it was a packed house, but half of the tables were empty!We ordered a french dip and some gyoza. &#160;After about 20 minutes, our french dip came out without the gyoza. &#160;Our server was apologetic, and after another 10 minutes our gyoza finally arrived.The french dip was okay, a french roll pilled with roast beef. &#160;Mediocre fries. &#160;My pet peeve is when the sandwich comes on a nice white plate, and the au jus is served in a paper cup. &#160;Invest in some decent bowls!The gyoza was almost inedible. &#160;It was obviously rushed-- quickly deep fried, then set in a row on the plate, and slathered in soy sauce. &#160;The result was a mushy and salty mess.I had a tab at the bar, and our server jumped the gun and charged my card with the balance of our meal. &#160;Luckily, it wasn't an issue for me, but for someone else it could have been a headache. &#160;We decided to tip what we thought was appropriate for the service experience. &#160;I work in the food industry-- normally, after charging your card, the receipt makes its way back for gratuity and it sits there until you leave. &#160;Our server came by again after five minutes, and snatched up our receipt. &#160;Great. &#160;Now we're feeling awkward because she probably won't be happy with the tip she got, and she gets to stroll around our table shooting us the stink-eye! &#160;Mercifully, she wasn't around our table often, much like the rest of our evening.In conclusion, just avoid this place. &#160;Until these guys get their act together, hire decent wait staff and find a new kitchen staff, there's not a lot to like about this place. This place was cute and quaint. &#160;I met some old friends here and I really enjoyed it. &#160;I ordered the fish and chips which was so awesome. &#160;The fish melts in your mouth. &#160;The waiter was great and attentive. &#160;They were setting up for karaoke but we left before anyone sang. &#160;I would definitely go back. Went today for lunch after work and was not all that impressed with the food. &#160;I ordered the Joe special and it tasted pretty bland considering that it had a bunch of cheese ontop of the eggs that were mixed with spinach, mushrooms, and hamburger. &#160;Basically I was looking foward to the eggs with mushrooms and spinach unfortunately it was lacking flavor without the addition of pepper. I have only eaten breakfast here but the experience didn't make me want to come back. &#160;I have tried a couple times to be sure it wasn't a fluke. &#160;The food is basic plastic breakfast food, a little worse than you would expect from Denny's or Sharis. &#160;The service is slow and indifferent.
After reading Tiff's and Terrell's reviews, I was chomping at the bit to try this haven of gluten-free indulgence. As we approached the stereo repair shop-turned-bakery, we couldn't help but wonder what was in store for us.Upon opening the door, we were greeted by a cute cafe, with a few tables, chairs, stools, a bus area along the wall, and plenty of good lookin' pastries peeking out from behind glass. Deciding which pastry to order was taxing, but I finally chose an apple scone and immediately signed the mailing list next to the cash register. Stephen opted for the boysenberry scone and a short latte.According to Stephen, the latte was "ok." The coffee tasted fine, but there was no foam. The scones? We were hella-impressed. Other gluten-free bakery products we have tasted were dry, but Da Vinci's scones were wonderfully moist. Stephen knocked me out of my faux flour daze when he thought out loud, "I wonder how much butter they put in these?" Yeah, I'm sure he's right. But my soul was happy, even if my arteries were going into spasm.There were separate baskets for trash and recyclables, with most items they serve being recyclable (napkins, paper plates, cups). How can you please a high maintenance Seattlelite more than providing gluten-free alternatives and promoting a green environment? On this soggy Seattle day, I'd been home awhile when I just decided I needed to get OUT! So I decided to make the gluten-free pilgrimage to DaVinci Bakery, which isn't a huge sacrifice since it's only 25 blocks from my house. If it hadn't been pouring its ass off, I could have ridden my bike there (which I might never do, but I could). In any case, I partly went because Stephen J. has turned me into a mocha-cayenne whore and partly because I needed to check out the whole gluten-free thing. It's a very cute cafe with parking in front and plenty of items to choose from. There is a wall of bread/muffin items to choose from and cake slices that looked scrumptious. There was also an assortment of sandwiches and dinner items such as lasagna.I ordered the Picasso which is an orange mocha with cayenne but I opted out of the orange. Seemed a bit much. Then I perused the bakery items on the counter. The chocolatey pumpkin cakes looked yummy but I chose a simple shortbread-y cookie with a cute holiday design. Driving away, I soon became covered in crumbs but it was worth it. The first bite of cookie was a little weird but by then I was hooked. It was flaky and airy and the perfect mix of sweet and salty. The coffee almost seemed to have too much cayenne but then didn't. I was startled by the hunks of chocolate left in the bottom, but lemme tell you they made that last sip delicious.Gluten-free folks have nothing to fear except eating too much dessert from DaVinci. Yum!Update: Last time I was back (cuz I just can't seem to stay away), I got a looksy at their yummy breakfast items that can be served hot. There was a breakfast panini with egg and bacon, a spinach-feta deep-dish quiche, and a breakfast pizza. They looked AWESOME!Also, I order our Thanksgiving pie from them - Brandy Apple. She gave me a taste and it was YUM! A little on the pricey side but saving me hours of work.
So good!Sandwiches, muffins... and did I mention coffee? And I can't believe I've waited this long to review this place...Prices are standard. I can't wait for the day that soy is the same price as cow milk... Sandwiches look hearty, and delicious... plus they even have a variety of croissant sandwiches in the morning.I've been stopping by this last week and ordering a delicious iced soy mocha. For once, I feel like my mocha doesn't taste of burnt, overly sweet, or too chocolately...Plus the servers are genuinely nice compared to the "I must kiss your ass" Starbucks, to the Stumptown crew who look down upon you as soon as you fumble your 8-word coffee order Friendly people and atmosphere. Good coffee. Delicious baked goods. Typical neighborhood coffee place. There was a young lady who accidentally dropped her coffee right outside the door and they gave her a replacement. &#160;Good customer service for that. I love this place. &#160;Can you say mellow? &#160;And not the least bit sullen - which sometimes accompanies mellow. &#160;Kids and dogs (outside) welcome. &#160;A pleasure. Cloud city kindly offered me an replacement Cuban Pork sanwich with all of the proper fixings. Best smoked pork sandwich north of Paseo! &#160;If you get cole slaw and add a beer, it's enough for 2.As always, the coconut bread is stellar!A real asset to the Maple Leaf neighborhoo! The Coconut bread alone is worth a star or two. &#160;Huge and sinfully delicious! &#160;Seriously though Cloud city has a nice neighborhood atmosphere. &#160;The pastries are a big cut above what you'll find at Starbucks. &#160;The trouble is, the coffee's just not that good. &#160;At least the drip stuff. &#160; If you guys switch it up to Stumptown or another gourmet brewer you'd earn an extra star from me. &#160;I wish yelp would let me give ya 4 and a half stars but I &#160;have to choose one or the other. This is the best coffee in the North Seattle area! There are so many options, even specialty coffees at certain times of the day. And now they have Mexican mochas! The employees are so friendly and know how to make the best coffee. The food is delicious, too! They even have soups!
This place is great! Skip the hassle and wait of of Jade Garden and check this place out. It's a bit hard to find as it's inside that scary looking ashy gray building on the other side of I-5, but it's worth the adventure. Pork Shumai is a winner as is the spareribs and probably the best walnut honey prawns I've had since leaving San Francisco. &#160;I try to hit this place as frequently as possible and always try to stop if I'm in the area. &#160;I especially like going during NFL season. &#160;It's a trip to be watching the Seahawks play while plowing through some seriously tasty dim sum.
I wish that dim sum was served 24hrs. That's a stretch most likely but wouldn't that just be so awesome? Heck, I love dim sum and I rarely go because I always miss the time! I know what you're thinking, dim sum is served 10am-3pm so how in the world do you miss it?!?! Because girls and boys I am a night person, I work late nights and I get home pretty darn late so I sleep pretty darn late! :) So with that said, it brings me to my review of this place. It was already evening and my then-bf and I were craving some dim sum so we did the whole search thing for a Chinese restaurant that is still serving dim sum and not going to charge us an arm and a leg for it. We ended up deciding on New Hong Kong mainly because we were already in the area. Since it was late, there was probably only 2 small other parties in the restaurant which was nice because it was so peaceful. Our server lady was extremely nice and welcoming. We already knew what we wanted so we quickly ordered some items off the dim sum menu and also a plate of house chow mien crispy. Again, it being kind of late and slow we got our food quickly and all piping hot! We got the bean curd wrap, fried shrimp salad, shu mui and some other stuff. Everything was delicious, especially the chow mien. The server checked on us a couple times asking how everything was and if there was anything we needed. We ended up having to box some of the food to go because we ordered just a wee bit too much ha ha. Also, the parking was free and in a garage! The only complaint is if you have a lowered car, it sucks majorly getting in and out of there. Still, I would go back at least for the late dim sum. FREE PARKING!!!Yum yum on the dim sum. Great service from some of the finest Chinese in the Pacific Northwest. They have really delicious chef specials and the venue is huge! Great for weddings and ceremonies. I've been to several weddings here and they've all been fantastic. It's a little hard to find but it's located next to Viet Wah at the PACIFIC RIM CENTER. Get at it. This place is not my favorite place to satisfy my chow mein and Peking duck cravings. I only go here for two reasons: 1) When my parents visit Seattle. They dread street parking, which is why they only go here for dinner. Yeah it's cool New Hong Kong has a free parking garage but sometimes I wish I can treat my parents to other restaurants (but that's a separate conversation). 2) Group gatherings. New Hong Kong does have the space for larger groups. I have came here for numerous graduation dinners, family gatherings and most recently a wedding rehearsal dinner. One perk of hosting a large group of people here is that when making your reservation and orders ahead of time, ask them if you can bring your own liters of soda. This place definitely allows it for free.99, which is so much better than letting your dinner guests order their own drinks. The food is alright for what it is. I eat what is ordered but like I said, I only come here when told to. I have tried dim sum here and it was alright as well. I just thought some of the dumplings were a little overcooked so they were on the chewy side. Oh and don't order the chicken feet here...they're not as flavorful as the other dim sum spots. Meh, not my favorite for dim sum. The best draw of this place is the free parking in the garage. Food wise, it's okay, but nothing memorable. Service wise...it's pretty poor. I've been here multiple times and it really depends on (i hate to say it) whether or not the majority of your &#160;party speaks mandarin or cantonese. If you do, it's easy to get the servers attention, if it's not...you'll be waiting for your water, waiter, bill, etc. Overall, nothing too memorable, but nothing overall horrible either. I didn't have high expectations for this place. &#160;Honestly, I thought the biggest plus was that they have their own parking lot. &#160; (Sad state of affairs that this is even a consideration, but whatevs.)It's a huge place and there was nobody else in the entire restaurant when we were there. &#160;Cantonese food that is chinese american-ish was the fare, and we ordered a ton of ordinary food.It came out quickly, hot and with good sized portions. &#160;Some were meh and some were tasty. &#160;The food didn't taste re-heated and some of food wasn't overcooked, like you get sometimes when there is a big menu to choose from and some of it is pre-made. &#160;The staff was quick to us and friendly. &#160;To be honest, I felt a little bad that there wasn't more business in here. &#160;It's not a place i would go out of my way to get to, but I'd come again every once in awhile. I'm still a dim sum newbie so I'm not yet sure what things are supposed to taste like, but New Hong Kong seemed like an a-ok destination!The restaurant is big, so there are plenty of tables. Sadly this means that sometimes it might take quite a while to get some food. I think we ran out of food 2-3 times and had to wait a while for the cart to make it over to our table. Also, it was a little annoying that the cart lady sometimes tried to give us certain plates even though we said we didn't want them.The food was over all pretty good and very filling. A few of the dumplings fell apart while I was trying to grab them, so that was a bit annoying. There was one salad(?) dish that was pretty gross. The Chinese broccoli was a-ok - not as great as the first time I tried it, not as horrible as the second time I tried it.The soupy tofu dessert thing was... not as tasty as it looked. I was a bit sad.A-ok dim sum choice, but I'll probably try the many other Seattle options before I go to New Hong Kong again. One of the better dim sum places in Seattle.It doesn't reach the heights of some of the others, but has a couple of factors weighing in its favor:- Parking! &#160;Easy, free, on-site, indoors :)- Space - it's a large restaurant and as such the wait, when there is one is usual only a couple of minutesThese two things alone are enough for me to sacrifice a further couple of percent quality wise for the speed/convenience.For me the measure of a dimsum place is the har gow or shrimp dumplings and on this front they don't disappoint, they are perfectly acceptable. &#160;One addition which marks them out vs. a lot of other dim sum places is that they have yu chee gow or shark's fin dumplings, (no, it's not actually made with shark's fin), they are superb. &#160;Xaio Long Bo are a miss sadly, too doughy.All in all a good, if not great dim sum place, with enough pluses to make this my normal spot in Seattle. A UYE - Dim Sum here - thanks Keoni and the restaurant owner making this happen. There were I believe a little than 20 people coming to the event. We got taken care of the first round pretty well.5 Stars to Parking! In International District, parking is always the problem. However, the building where New Hong Kong Restaurant is located has a good amount of parking.4 Stars to Service! Staff was really friendly and nice. They greeted me and my friends with warmth and made sure we were able to find the rest of Yelpers. There were 20ish of us and they were able to bring the dishes in and out, fill water.2.5 Stars to the food! There are good selections of Dim Sum. However, I can only say they are ok. Some of the seafood steamed dumplings might not be properly prepared. Therefore, the skin came up be broken (not sure if it's over-steamed). Chicken feet, somehow, I felt it was lack of flavor. A lot of the ingredients of the Dim Sum items are the same. Therefore, I ate pretty much the same things with different looks. Though, I have to give kudos to my favorite dish, beef meat balls. I gave beef balls 4 stars. As far as tea goes, it was just very blend tea. A lot of other Dim Sum places offer special tea with more flavors. (This is based off of utilizing a $20 gift certificate offered to me as a return gift from the owner, Jeremy, after he found out about my recent visit to the Rainier location)I decided to try this location out for lunch takeout the other day. So onto the #7 bus I go from downtown. Hop off at Jackson and I-5 and walk up here. Right away, Jeremy was at front and greeted me. He's welcoming, cool and friendly and what I felt right away, despite the usual lunch crowd there. I had stuff in mind, while he also offered me suggestions AND ways to best take advantage of the full $20. I appreciated that but told him just "enough for lunch and not too much". So, instead of 2 dishes and an app, he mentioned a rice side to compliment my general tao's chicken, as well as my tofu salt &amp; pepper app. He recommended the almond chicken from this kitchen because (since he seems pretty darn knowledgable about his chefs) it's better plus they're sliced and not chunks(?), like Rainier. Tempting, but wanted something different. I didn't know what my extra fork was for.I got back to the office. Down the Tofu app. Opened general tao's chicken... does general tao's chicken taste like sweet and sour chicken? Ugh, I'm pretty sure the wrong dish was here... as a sweet and sour chicken, it was decent but way too saucy. As what I ordered, I don't think sweet and sour is General Tao's Chicken... the Tofu app was darn good, though with chopped garnished stuff and GARLIC! =D3.5 = food. 4 = service from Jeremy. I'm so glad that the manager was honest when he told me which foods contained MSG and which did not. It happen to be that 99% of the dim sum contained MSG. He said the resturant will cooked menu items and not add MSG which is very nice since the resturant wasnt slow or busy. I mean he could of said "nothing."I had a few salty dim sum items in the bamboo containers. Ribs were good soft and not overly salty. Chow mein noodles a little undercooked. Shrimp inside green chile peppers were way too spicy for breakfast hours. The leaffy greens were perfect: crispy, not too salty, and sauce is optional.I did not stay for tofu desserts or the sesame ball. I wasn't craving these items. &#160; I spent about $30 for a group of 3 people. Another solid but usually unspectacular dim sum place in Seattle. Usually less of a line and easier parking than for other restaurants in the heart of the ID, but still better to be there early than late- 2nd time for dim sum here. We were seated extremely fast, and free parking - 5 stars for that. I thought quality of food was average on my first visit and below average today. There was a long pause between food carts; we almost left earlier before finishing. I doubt we will be back. LOVE THIS PLACE! My parents know the owners. That's how intense we eat here often. We always get chow fun and the crunchy noodle chow mein w bok choy and beef. Super delicious, the dim sum is good especially the shrimp tempura and the bean curd, the jelly fish dish is marvelous as well. this is my go to place for group dim sum outings. &#160;they have free parking, there's never a wait for a table, and it always comes out to be about $10-13 per person...it must be the cheapest dim sum place in Seattle. &#160;The food quality is pretty decent too, though nothing is particularly outstanding...but they have all the typical dim sum staples. &#160;My favorite dim sum place for the actual food quality is Harbor City, but you don't have the above benefits. &#160;My biggest complaint about this place is how aggressive they are about throwing food on your table...you practically have to say "no" 2-3 times, otherwise they will just start putting random dim sum on your table that you didn't ask for! I love this place. They're hand-shaved noodles are off the chain. I asked the waiter what was good and he recommended the noodles, saying that they make them fresh in the back and i should try them out. Ok so i was skeptical at first, i mean, how good can they possibly be? Pretty good i would have to say. My friends werent too happy with their sweet and sour chicken though, apparently too over battered. Then again, this is sweet and sour chicken we're talking about!? Anybody who orders sweet and sour chicken is not allowed to express opinion regarding foods and might as well go to Mcdonald's, order a 20 piece, ask for excessive amounts of sweet and sour, slap on a pair of latex's, fill up a spray bottle with the S&amp;S, and unload an awesomeness fury of sauce coating, with surgical precision of course. Service was also excellent! But then again I speak Chinese. (sorry to the minorities who aren't Chinese "j/k")Will I return? of course, I work next door One of the few places in the city that serves dim sum all day long! Very affordable, nice portions, taste yummy! I usually come here for the dim sum and a side of fried rice. Typical dim sum selection...shrimp dumpling, fried dumpling, spareribs, etc. Love it all. The staff if very attentive and nice. This is a great place to bring a big group. While there are dim sum places that are comparable, and possibly cheaper. I gave this place 5 stars because there's never a wait to be seated, and they have an extensive menu aside from the dim sum menu. http://bomb.com2x a weekfave-shrimp and tofu We've been going here on many occasions, dim sum, dinners, lunches. &#160;Their food's been ok so far, however I haven't have dinner here for a while, just Dim sum, and for the most part they still tastes fine, not a lot of selections but they tastes just fine. &#160;Last Sunday I came here to have dinner, I had the imperial pork, the crispy duck, and some prawns, the duck was very good, the prawn was ok, But The PORK, OMG the PORK, I was SOOOOO SWEET! Like it was deep in caramel, omg we couldn't even eat it that's why star subtraction, plus my water glass was empty and was not refill, even after we paid, they came over to ask if we need anything to go, my water glass was still empty, no one refill it, oh well. &#160;I don't think I will come back here for dinner anymore, maybe just Dim Sum.... i uses to love going to this place because the food was good and they have free parking, lately though the selection for dim sum has gotten fewer and fewer. the service? SUCKS. u really &#160;have to flag waiters down and they tend to ignore people. so not sure we'll be coming back. The food was below par to be honest. Parking is kinda difficult because you have to go up a hill and take a left turn get a parking space. Service could be stepped up more like other restaurants. Food seems tempting, but can use more flavor. Located about half a block up and down from a bus stop. They have dim sum all day, great service, and free parking. I went between lunch and dinner when the place was less crowded and the food was still hot and fresh not reheated. Hot and sour soup is so good here. Saturday and sunday mornings things can get pretty crowded but &#160;restaurant is huge so theres hardly ever a wait. Yummy chinese food! =) We had dim sum for lunch over there. The staff are very friendly, but food &#160;there is not very impressive.
ok, i feel obligated to give 5 stars not only for the scrumptious shumai made from secret meat, but for customer service, or shall i say "homie" service. this is my first choice to go have chinese, b/c the food is good (it beats purple dot, hoho, honeycourt, o'asian (egh, ohgod!!!!!!!) or other cockroach infested places cool people go to!) i feel welcomed, parking is not a hassle - if you find a spot, then you better know how to maneuver, and I am not going to throw a fit because of a wedding/party occurring simultaneously with regular hours, the staff knows how to coordinate!!!it is super busy on weekends, so it's reasonable the staff could not be %100 super attentive and cater to your needs, however they are super kind!!i miss the former location (the safest neighbor"hood" in seattle, rainier), but the new location is perfectly fine b/c "you can take it away from the hood, but you can't take the hood out of it." whoo-hoo! Yeah, I have to agree with some of the previous reviews. This place use to be the place to go. Now.. not so much. The Dim Sum is 'eh' and the staff is a bit pushy. But that is to be expected. That's how they do it back in Hong Kong. I always wondered if they got paid by the plate. The parking lot is indeed crappy, and it would help if they would put some signage next to the elevator buttons. (It's on the 3rd floor??) I got lost trying to find this place. I'm surprised this place has gotten such bad reviews... I was never a patron when it was under the previous owners/management but I certainly haven't had trouble enjoying their wide variety of dim sum on Sundays! &#160;i mean, there is a reason why it's still crowded every weekend with mostly Asians... I have yet to try their a la carte menu however... anyone has any favorite dishes to recommend?I have been there early when they open at 10am for dim sum and the variety is rather limited. &#160;Only the steamed items. &#160;The crowd starts flowing in about 11'ish so I say the best time to come here is about 11:30am... &#160;the prawns, the calamari, fried noodles come out then.The parking garage is kind of funky and very dark - especially on a bright sunny day. &#160;Driving in might need some adjusting but hey, it's free parking and you don't have to drive block after block looking for a spot. &#160;So I say deal with whatever comes with the free parking. &#160;I usually don't like waiting for the elevator - especially on weekends - it's just WAY too slow. &#160;Take the stairs or walk out of the garage and enter the building from the front entrance... After brunch, you can walk ten steps out of New Hong Kong and get a foot or combo massage from Imperial Foot Massage :D ***The New Kowloon restaurant is now New Hong Kong restaurant, so the rating is no longer applicable.My husband and I used to love to come here (New Kowloon) for dim sum. &#160;The food was good, hot, and fresh with easy parking, but note we USED TO... &#160;Then it all changed, the food was soggy, bland, and bad. &#160;Apparently when we went it was under new ownership, and later name changed to New Hong Kong restaurant. &#160;I don't think dim sum was their forte...See below for mystery solved on what happened to New Kowloon:http://www.nwasianweekly&#8230; I like when New Hong Kong is busy on the weekends because it ensures that the food is always fresh. &#160;There's nothing worse than a dead dim sum restaurant because who knows how long the food has been on the cart?The dim sum here is reasonably priced and is just a notch above average compared to other dim sum restaurants. &#160;I always use the shaomai as a standard because every dim sum joint should have it, and the good restaurants do it well. &#160;New Hong Kong's shaomai is good. &#160;The filling is nothing to write home about--standard pork, shrimp, mushroom. &#160;What I appreciate the most is that the noodle wrap was tender--perfectly cooked. &#160;It was not dried out and crunchy. &#160;The shaomai overall was not chewy like rubber.The service was good. &#160;All dim sum service is pushy, you just have to be assertive. &#160;New Hong Kong dim sum cart drivers don't mind when you show them who's boss.New Hong Kong is is worth the trip into the ID, and it is located in the Pacific Rim Center where parking is free in the garage. &#160;That in itself is a bonus. &#160;It is probably the reason New Hong Kong gets the 4th star. From my experience, not too bad, not too good as well. &#160;The new parking garage is a love-hate relationship. &#160;I love the convenience of being able to park, however with the hill and "dip" I find myself bottoming out on my car often. &#160;The food is okay, and the dim-sum if you come early is good, not so much after the morning rush because you'll be serve what it seem as "left-overs". &#160;So come early for the best experience and hot dim sum. &#160;Another pro is that this new place is huge and definitely can accommodate your big party. Only time I come here is for dim sum, and the dim sum is almost comparable to Bay Area dim sum. &#160;The only downside is trying to park. &#160;That structure is scary as hell to try to drive around in. come hither thy tasty cart of dim sum goodies! commence with the gluttony!variety &amp; selection= *** although the flavor isn't very robust. could use more savory than just soy saucy. &#160;wasn't impressed by the quality of the chicken feet there. &#160;btw, the congee is great for a sick, hungover stomach, just don't eat the pieces of black 1000-year-old eggs if you haven't acquired the taste or you might feel worse. &#160;this place gets super crowded for weekend brunch, so plan to go before noon or maybe after 2. &#160;the parking garage is tight, but at least there is some fucking parking right there for free.isn't the name "New Hong Kong" now? &#160;Way to sell out...
Falafel, falafel, falafel! &#160;Need I say more? &#160;Mediterranean Mix has the best falafel in Seattle! &#160;Plus, it is cheap ($4.50)! &#160;The gyro sandwhich is good as well, but the falafel is better. &#160;The only drawback is the lack of seating; it gets pretty crowded there, so go early to snag a seat. &#160;Do you falafel?

I like this place so much, I falafel. Seriously, it is where I go for falafels in Seattle. They are fresh, filling, full of tastiness and only &#160;$4.50.The vegetable plate looks amazing as well. They also serve gyros and pizza, but I can't get past the awesome falafels.
Finally a vegetarian, non asian food restaurant in Seattle which serves up great comfort food instead of stir fries. &#160;Don't get me wrong, I love some vegetarian Thai every now and again. &#160;It's just that I crave variety in my eating habits, and can only eat on Capitol Hill at the Teapot restaurant and the restaurant, In the Bowl, so much. &#160;The only drawback: &#160;Silence Heart Nest is closed for dinner. &#160;Today we ordered the western round up, and the country comfort. &#160;both, stupendous breakfast meals. &#160;I wish i had found this place sooner..... we tried this place on a whim, and it was delicious!the prices were good and the food tasted very healthy and delicious.i got the eggs benedict with home fries and a side of sweet potato biscuits. and everything was great! the BF got a mozarella and pesto sandwich that tasted really good too (i tried a bite). overall, a little cult-ish, but they seem harmless. definitely a new tasty (moderately healthy) breakfast place to add to our list. After two visits to Silence-Heart-Nest I feel like the food could be a little more exciting... but maybe I'm not getting the right dishes???The employees are very nice, the service is quick and the atmosphere is very peaceful.The first time I stopped in for a veggie burger. &#160;It was very good but something I could have prepared at home.This past weekend my husband and I went there for breakfast. &#160;I had the pesto, mozzarella, egg white omelet with the sweet potato biscuit.It was good... but not outstanding. &#160;Kinda watery.I was a big fan of Victory's Banner back in Chicago and hoped to have some of the same menu choices here... I hope to upgrade my rating once I have returned a few more times... tried the french toast... and maybe some of the curry or dal type dishes. One of my favorite places to have breakfast or lunch. &#160;Amazing soups and curries with a very serene environment. Good food. &#160;My vegan/vegetarian friends like it. &#160;Seating in the back kind of lousy. &#160;Last one to the breakfast meetup has to face the wall for 45 min at Silence. We are not vegetarians but really enjoyed our meals. They were flavorful, reasonably priced, and the service was great. If you are a vegetarian you need to try this place and if you're not a vegetarian...you'll be pleasantly surprised if you do. I'm not vegetarian, but it's nice going out for food and eating a healthy, vegetarian meal that tastes good. &#160;It's not good vegetarian food, it's good food period.The Neat Loaf is my mainstay, though the guacamole/bacon burger follows pretty close. &#160;The breakfasts are good, and I love the seasoned potatoes as a side.The staff is attentive and friendly. &#160;I do see they have a certain spiritual bent with all of the Sri Chimnoy items and card affirmations, but I don't mind so much since it's all background.If you're not satisfied or if you get them right at closing time they sometimes give you 'silence heart dollars' toward a future meal, which is great for us po folk. &#160;This is my number one spot in Fremont without a doubt. &#160;You can't beat delicious food that makes you feel good after eating it. First of all let me say, this place is slightly bizarre, but in the most genuinely-interesting-sort-of-way. It's a restaurant/shrine dedicated to Sri Chinmoy, a celebrated guru and spiritual teacher who passed away a few years ago.The prices are good, it's all vege-ma-tarian and though I didn't try any of the more "interesting" food on the menu (Neat-Loaf with BBQ sauce... Sweet Potato Biscuits with Cashew Gravy) the food I DID try was excellent! They have everything from Mac n' Cheese to Curry.Go ahead and give it a try ; ) I had the Mediterranean Omelet, which was quite delicious, however they were unable to tell me if their "homemade" gluten-free bread had yeast in it or not which makes me suspect they didn't really make it.The service was terrible. &#160;The tables were sticky. &#160;The servers looked grim, especially the sari-clad women, who seemed to carry the weight of the world on their shoulders. &#160;The pale blue space looks pleasant enough but the cult-like energy of the servers darkens the sunlit dinning room.The bad energy has tainted the food. &#160;Neither I nor my partner felt well after eating there. &#160;Not sure if the intestinal distress was due to the cuisine or the atmosphere but I don't plan on going back. &#160;There are too many good vegetarian options in the city to warrant a return to this gloomy cultville. &#160;Someone should liberate those women from their sari's and send them over to Chaco Canyon for some truly delicious vegetarian food served with a smile. Best non-diner breakfast in Seattle. &#160;The atmosphere is always great. &#160;The service is kind and done well. &#160;If you are a vegetarian this is the breakfast place for you!The have amazing french toast and feature morning star breakfast faux meats. &#160;Go before you get too hungry because this place can have a long wait Why must every vegetarian place always TRY to make stuff taste like meat. That being said the "neat" loaf was probably the best thing there. But they do have this weird coffee but it's not coffee &#160;that is worth trying. One thing I will give to them though - perfect scrambled eggs. I think they use a milkshake machine to mix um You can always feel good about eating here on a number of levels. First, the staff will never be rude.Second, you aren't eating the flesh of an animal.Third, the food is just fantastic.Their breakfasts are the absolute best. Lunch is pretty terrific too-- the neatloaf is legendary. &#160;Vegan options for just about every menu item. Love it. Love, love, love it. This place rocks. &#160;I love the ambience...soothing blue everywhere...delightful birds painted on the walls. &#160;The food is deliscious. I had heuvos rancheros....perfect. &#160;Their coffee is great, too. &#160;The prices are just right. &#160;I loved the cards at each table with meditative thoughts. &#160;I'll be back. I'm giving this place 4 stars for my personal experience, but my boyfriend said he would only give it 2 stars based on what he ordered (the neatloaf, which I know is most people's favorite, but he did not like it). I got the fresh mozzarella, spinach, pesto sandwich and it was awesome. I don't like vegan things or fake meat so I just went with a veggie option and I'm glad I did. The cheese was nicely melted and the pesto had a great flavor and was a nice proportion to the rest of the filling. I want to go back to try the mac and cheese... I think its safe to say this is my favorite cult run breakfast joint in the Seattle area. Their vegan/vegatarian options are just weird enough to make them interesting to eat. My standard is the western round up, but I sometimes get an extra sesame pancake. My friends always get the spicy breakfast items or a sandwich. The coffee cups are huge and the staff keep them filled. I have never had a bad meal here and we hardly ever have to wait for a table. As far as the cult goes, well, Chinmoy is dead and he's not sexually exploiting or fibbing about weightlifting anymore. I find it fascinating that the guy had convinced so many people that he was an avatar of god. In relation to other cults though, this one is pretty tame. The pictures of Chinmoy in the restaurant are a little creepy, but it adds to the ambiance. The staff are all very nice and fast. The restaurant is bright and clean. Terrific!great atmosphere, wonderful menu items.I'm from the South and I would characterize this place as a wonderful blend of Soul Food meets the Pacific NW. &#160;And where else can you find Vegetarian biscuits and gravy?? &#160;Yum. Thanks to a close friend who relocated to Seattle from California AND turned on me to the Fremont Street Fair I have become a huge fan of this place due to my many trips up North !The prices aren't as low as I would like, I wish the menu and portions were larger and the staff can be a bit cranky but this is still a classic West Coast/Seattle experience ! I love the vegetarian options, I love the whole Hindu/meditation/Sri Chimnoy vibe...Great colors, great location, very homey and comfortable and all sorts of reminders everywhere regarding spirituality and meditation....Staff are all Sri Chimnoy devotees and dress the part....Excellent place for breakfast or lunch. Silence-Heart-Nest is consistently incredible. I have never gotten something here that I didn't like. The space is beautiful, calm, and a welcome respite from the crazy corner of 34th and Fremont and all of the traffic. The tofu salad with the house dressing is wonderful paired with a slice of their homemade bread. The Western Round-Up is also great, as well as the sweet potato biscuits. This is truly food to make you feel good inside. A visit to Seattle is not complete without brunch at Silence Heart Nest.During my vegetarian days, this place was like a mecca for me. Now that I've crossed back over to the meat side - I still love it!The Western Round-up (Sweet potato biscuits, veggie sausage, cashew gravy, and house potatoes) is my standard - but the menu has yet to disappoint anyone that I've taken there. I love this place but can never remember the name. &#160;My friends and I refer to it as "The hippie cult place" or "that place in Fremont where you feel like you are eating inside of an aquarium" (everything is blue in there).What I can say is this:Great vegetarian food for a decent price, and great mochas (I like them sweet). &#160;For once, there is a place to go for vegetarian brunch that isn't 30 pounds of fake meat and starch. Vegetarian food, calm ambiance and reasonable prices make this place a win for everyone. (Meat lovers can survive for one meal with the Neatloaf.) &#160;Oh, they also have gluten free bread and pancakes. &#160;Indeed most of the food isn't going to win any awards for innovation or killer recipes, but sometimes you just need to go out and eat something decent and healthy and be on with your day.We had a post-church brunch there Sunday with kids, something I often dread from my brunch-hauling days waiting tables. It's wasn't totally packed in there and the servers were SUPER nice and sweet. They made the six year old pancakes in the shape of a bunny. They brought little dinosaurs and trucks to the table. We were served quickly. I wish I could say as much for other restaurants. Im not even close to being a vegetarian...but I am willing to forgo Saturday morning bacon for a delicious breakfast at Silence Heart Nest. &#160;The eggs are fluffy, perfectly seasoned and delicious....the pesto toast is incredible and the perfect AM appetizer for 2. &#160;Sometimes Im in the mood for the sweet potato biscuits....as good as they are though they are a little dry without gobs of butter. &#160;I love everything else though...the location, the lack of long lines...the friendly wait staff, and the self-entertainment the Sri Chinmoy quote cards provide at the table while you await your meal. &#160;Cant comment on lunch...but it is one of our weekend brunch staples! I've been here a handful of times and have yet to be disappointed. My personal favorites are the Eggs Florentine for only $6 or the Western Roundup for $8.95. Those two dishes alone are worth the trip to this peaceful diner in the heart of Fremont. Came in for breakfast and got seated right away. Decided on the western round-up which is a vegan version of biscuits and gravy. The sweet potato biscuits were the best part.Overall it was tasty but nothing to write home about. It did have a sorta weird cult vibe to it.If I were in Fremont and had vegetarian or vegan friends I would be willing to go back but otherwise there are more interesting places in Fremont. It's hard to find a Vegetarian restaurant that does a great rendition of breakfast staples.My boyfriend and I had breakfast here today, on a packed Saturday morning of the Fremont Solstice Parade. &#160;There are wait times everywhere so we decided to try this place.I was scared to try the soy bacon, as I haven't successfully moved on from PTSD on a vegan breakfast sausage I bought somewhere. &#160;It was surprisingly good as it also beautifully and tastefully intermingled with the rest of the food on my plate of Eggs Benedict. &#160;Their Hollandaise sauce kicks ass (way better than the over priced Eggs Benedict at that Breakfast place by Alki Beach that could have used a parsley perhaps to give contrast to flavors?)The breakfast sausage on my boyfriend's breakfast plate tasted like, guess what? &#160;breakfast sausage! &#160;Very affordable and good vegetarian restaurant to try. &#160;The Yogi chai is spicily calming and the set of aphorism cards on the table are nice and inspiring distractions while you wait for your food. good breakfast, great location, reasonably priced. kinda weird knowing the waitstaff are celibate cult members, but hey, who am i to judge! Got into town last night at midnight after a long trip, had nothing in the fridge for brekkie, and decided to look on Yelp for Help. &#160;Thanks to the reviews here, I decided to try this restaurant for breakfast, which is in my 'hood'. &#160;I haven't been here since it was the Longshoreman's Daughter - more than 5 years ago. &#160;If you get there before 11 am mid week, there are some pretty good deals for only 6 bucks! &#160;I had the Eggs Florentine. &#160;Probably one of the best I've ever had. &#160;Instead of the home fries, I subbed it for black beans - so yummy! &#160; Eggs were cooked to perfection, the Hollandaise was fabulous, perhaps with some dill I think, the spinach was very fresh and not overcooked. &#160;The only thing that would make this pure perfection is if the english muffin were whole grain flax seed - but then it wouldn't be 6 bucks any longer. &#160; Loved the atmosphere &#160;- cool colors, soothing music without being too new agey, service was just right. &#160;I'll be back - if only for those black beans!! &#160;mmmmmm Pleasantly surprised by this place. And this is coming from someone who used to garnish my Boca burger with a slice of ham and a fried egg! The menu had a lot of variety and imagination and best of all it was tasty. Would definitely go there again. I had the omelet with yams and blue cheese and was impressed at how well the flavors blended.Of and they use a milkshake makes to blend their eggs which makes it super fluffy. My friends got mostly vegan stuff and everyone liked it. Prices weren't too bad either. Will go back fo sure. This place is hilarious. This place is also very weird. I went to Silence-Heart-Nest yesterday for breakfast with my friend and his friend. I ordered the eggs benedict, which came with MorningStar frozen bacon as the "meat". If I went here eight years ago, I would have been so, so happy, but I just don't like that MorningStar fake meat like I used to, so mehhh. The eggs and hollandaise were perfect though, and the paprika on top really added the right smokey flavor. I didn't like the potatoes it came with though, they were much too garlicy. I think the best part were the cards on the table. They have art and quotes by the deep Sri Chinmoy, which makes breakfast fun. I think the best quote was, "each happy life-car needs an encouragement-engine". My dream come true, however, would be to get the Sri Chinmoy followers on a softball team against Loving Hut's Supreme Master Ching Hai's followers (http://www.yelp.com/biz/&#8230;). How can we make this happen? Of the three or four times I've gone here, I've always had a good meal. My favorite is the Neat Loaf (like meat loaf?) sandwich. The full one is big; the half order is just right for lunch. I've also had the veggie BLT that was tasty as well.The service there is nice and I like the atmosphere. It's like a diner, but everything there is vegetarian (well, besides the eggs). I really like this place. Vegetarian breakfast joint??? &#160;Sure, why not.This place totally reminds me of Ananda Fuara in San Francisco - same light blue interior paint, same old broads wearing the same full length flower-print dresses. &#160;But... I digress, no paint nor clothing nor crustiness of waitress matters when the grub comes fast, correct and made to order.I had the Center of the Universe Scramble which was 3 scrambled eggs, onions (eekkk) mushrooms, white cheddar, spinach and garlic - way good. &#160;But... as good as this was, my daughter's Pesto wrap blew my order. &#160;Maybe I am just a pesto junkie, who knows, but, this may be the top 5 best breakfast items I ever had.Great grub in a cool neighborhood. &#160;Now, all that is needed is younger waitresses without the floor-length window-drape dresses.Just kidding. &#160;Not really. &#160;But yes...maybe.Ya feel me? I go way back with SHN and I saw John Mclaughlin live twice before he strayed. &#160;It's easy to make fun of anything (pick something-insert it here) and this is no exception.The reason I still eat here and look forward to eating here is the food. &#160;Well prepared breakfasts; the biscuits and gravy are far above average restaurant fare, fresh and trustworthy eggs prepared perfectly, I could live out my life on their fried potatos. &#160;If you are looking for meat, you can get an approximation served with your eggs, potatos and biscuits. &#160;However, if you are looking for meat this isn't where you should be eating- of course.Those seeking some sort of "comfort food" without the original meat components can't go wrong with the neatloaf/mac&amp;cheese suggested in other reviews. &#160;I've eaten it and loved it.I eat meat and prefer to kill, prepare it myself rather than trusting someone else - because people can be devious bastards. &#160;If others provide or prepare it, I take great pains in learning everything about the source of the meat. I don't worry about any of that eating here- I just get a good, healthy meal served by wonderful people. And, it's a big, happy-blue, old-timey diner in the center of Freemont. &#160;And, it will make you cooler and hip. &#160;I know - that was more than one reason. &#160;Sorry. Vegetarians delight -- also good for people just back from India spiritual retreats. &#160;I felt underdressed without my sari. &#160;But damn, the brunch was excellent -- juevos rancheros awesome-os. &#160;Pretty cheap, too. &#160;I hear they are closed one week a year for an employee retreat -- something tells me this is unlike most corporate retreats at posh resorts and instead involves not showering and lots of incense. &#160;Do whatever you need to do, just keep the awesome food coming. The Neat Loaf sandwich could be the greatest discovery since Nuclear energy. &#160;Good Grief! &#160;Oh and the Mac and cheese doesn't suck either :o) Good service, solid vegetarian food... not crazy about the home fries but very ready to try this place again. and again. and again? will update asap Try the sesame waffles. It was yum and had an Asian flair. My friend had an omelet that was also delicious, and if you're going to get biscuits, try the sweet potato ones. Good meal and good prices. I have been here for breakfast numerous times and always have a desire to go back. It is just one of those places. Breakfast was pleasant as a single on a bar stool, and is comfortable at a table with friends and family. The vibe of the space is sunny and inviting. The staff is pleasant and always smiling. The staff really seems to enjoy their service. The menu offers many options from hearty breakfasts &amp; lunches to vegetarian/vegan options. The specials of the day are usually tempting- especially when they are seasonal items like peach blueberry pancakes. I have personally enjoyed the tomato/spinach eggs benedict here- as well as a garden garlic scramble of sorts. My meat loving dining partner loved the meat free huevo rancheros. The food always tastes fresh, and I am genuinely impressed with the wonderful home-cooked taste. FYI's~ * There are inspirational quote cards on the tables * They offer many $6 weekday breakfast specials * Many varieties of meat substitutes * Great coffee* Most menu items under $10 Excellent breakfast or brunch joint, particularly for those who are vegetarian or vegan as they serve no meat here (just soy alternatives when necessary). I thought my food was delicious and the coffee very good. Fun menu selections and seasonal offerings.The place has a Hindi influence, especially dedicated to Sri Chinmoy.
Mostly, I've had breakfast sandwiches from here, which are good, but how hard is it to mess up egg, cheese and bacon on an english muffin? The times I've ordered anything else on their exhaustive menu I've been disappointed. The pork teriyaki was dry. The burger is fine, the meat (like the chicken sandwich) is previously frozen but the veggies seem fresh. I wish they'd trim the menu and focus on fewer items. Also, yellow mustard does not belong on a chicken sandwich, no matter how many condiments you need to add to make it palatable.
A-OK. I used to love this place, but lately...I'm not so sure. Good happy hour, cheap brunch, huge backdoor patio, too many white belts. Not as disgusting as the Cha Cha, but the staff still looks like they're stuck in 2002. Linda's is fun with good company. &#160;You can sit back, have some drinks and take in the scene while enjoying a good buzz. Jukebox is always a plus. Pretty standard bar, nothing particularly amazing or horrible about it. &#160;Other than the pool table - which would be a good thing, not a bad thing, clearly, but there are many bars with many pool tables - I guess I just have a thing for playing pool. &#160;But I digress. &#160;The grub here isn't bad, the patio in the back is pretty chill. &#160;The chairs are kind of uncomfortable in the back, but you have to give them props for the paint by numbers mural [I'm thinking 17 = forest green, 39 = happy red, 82 = murder blue...]. &#160;Foodwise, the fish and chips were aight - the fries are better then the fish methinks, and I like that their chicken fried steak has a spicy kick to it in the sauce. I really could care less about the scene of this place or its atmosphere. I'm so fing hungover when I come in here, it really doesn't matter. Weekend brunch is what brings me in, more specifically, their bloody mary. I'm not really sure which sides I prefer in my bloody mary: sometimes I really enjoy gnawing on the celery, but then again, I love me some pickled beans. And generally, it's one or the other. Their version comes with with both. Plus a peperoncini and several olives. It's a revelation. Their food is definitely worth mentioning as well. It's priced under the norm and yet, my omelette wasn't lacking in either portion or taste. And for the times I'm not hungover, (their brunch is only offered on the weekend, cut me some slack) they offer a pitcher of mimosas for $15. Something the whole table can enjoy. On a warm summer night the back deck is perfect. &#160;Little smoking area just sprouted up last week (right behind it) after the management got nailed (again) by Seattle's no-smoking-in-public-places law.Decent benches and great for 6-8 friends.Plus I heard the word "Re-donk-ulous" for the first time since I lived with Matt from U-dub in LA.I miss everything being redonkulous. Fried comfort grub, loud music, and cheap beer. It's like Valhalla for hipsters.Mike's Meatloaf is dee-lish, and the patio is a surprising oasis, even for a non-smoker like myself. Check out the wall o'pictures and see if you can find ex-significant others - then try to refrain from adding mustaches and devil horns to them. Linda's is one of those places i've always avoided in Seattle, not only because it was a favorite of an ex-gf, but also because it tends to attract the same scensters as the cha cha, only slightly more strung out.However, this past weekend I ended up having brunch there, out on the back patio, and it was actually kind of cool. &#160;They even have a cocktail that is made out of Emergen-C, which is perfect for Sunday morning hangovers.So hey, have brunch with strung out hipsters sometime I hit up Linda's last night, expecting to arrive just in time for happy hour at 5:30. Well, for whatever reason, Linda's happy hour does not begin until 7pm. While this could have been advantageous had I known in advance, my ignorance of their unorthodox practices left me paying full price for my booze.Nevertheless, I had an enjoyable time chillin' out max and relaxin' all cool on the back patio. I would like to emphasize the cool and the chillin' as once the sun went down, the outdoor setting got a might nipply. Unfortunately, none of the staff bothered to turn on the gas heaters until one of the guests, obviously delirious with cold, got up and started messing with the propane tank.I ordered a couple of Guinness and the meatloaf. The service was friendly and reasonably quick at first, though once we began eating, the waitress became more scarce. The meatloaf was tasty, with big chunks of onion, but it was one of the crumbliest meatloaves I have ever eaten. Also, they were mighty stingy on the mashed potatoes. If I had known I was only going to get a wee dollop, I would have asked them to substitute the other veggies (evil broccoli and filthy, vile zucchini) for a double helping of spuds.
I'm not really a 'go hang out at bars' person, but I have friends who are, so found myself here with a group of them after a show at the Neptune. It was getting close to closing time but they still let us come in and hang out for a while without giving us any grief about it. The atmosphere was cool, dimly lit, candles on the table tops. Drinks were brought out promptly and there was no issues with opening separate tabs for all of us. &#160;It looked like they had some good specialty drinks on their menu. I stuck with one of my usual drinks for the evening but might be more adventurous should I return. The drinks did seem fairly strong, but then again I'm kind of a lightweight. Overall a nice place! It was a weeknight and the bf and I wanted a quiet lounge to cozy up and have a drink in. &#160;My other requirement was a couch. We drove past The District and I remembered how I always passed it when I was an underage student so in we went.One side was being remodeled and there was a piano. &#160;My bf said sometimes they have jazz shows there but it was a quiet night this time. &#160;Just as I hoped, there were couches and cushions and it was a quiet spot. &#160;I had the Kungfu Girl riesling because of the funny name and he had some tea. &#160;The riesling was not too sweet and not bad- as most wines with silly names have been in my experience. &#160;They have a nice classy display of cucumber infused water as well. &#160;This is a nice classy spot especially considering its just off the Ave. &#160;I would def. come back if they had music or if I wanted a quiet night like that again.. &#160;It's the kind of place I would go with the bf (Again) or a group of friends who just wants to chat and drink without getting rowdy. We have had a number of work functions at District Lounge and they've all been great. &#160;Their happy hour prices are low and it isn't crowded at that time of day. &#160;I've never really gone there at night, but it is a great after work spot.
Three cheers and four stars for mediocrity.Let's face it, there are times in life where the last thing I want is great food. Great food can get me all bonery, then I've got slug trails to explain. A great atmosphere can send me falling back in my chair, and drinks? Well, yeah - great drinks will send me walking home at 3am shouting at my mother from when I was five years old and pounding on the wrong apartment door.There is something to be said about being the best at being medium. Especially in hungover-type situations, Pho is just good medicine and the last thing I want is something so good my ears start ringing. I want good enough, medium, easy peasy. Medium blends in. Medium is not likely to get into trouble. No one ever pees themselves, falls down and loses a tooth or wakes up with a farm animal from medium. Medium is ok with me. Sometimes.This is where Than Bros truly shines. I like taking it home even better because you get to put it together from all the different little containers. It always looks like a lot more in your own bowls and you can get all caveman on it while shoveling into your gob. Thanks Than Bros. You're OK. At 12:45 we came in for lunch and sat down and shortly after we were served water and garnishes. We tried to order 2 vegan pho's and the kid working there just said they're running out of vegetable broth. We asked what that meant, can they make more, could we wait but he just kept saying do you want beef broth?He asked us this multiple times and we said no, we don't want to have vegan pho with beef broth. The whole point is that you should have enough vegetable broth for the lunch hour. I almost think maybe they don't even have any vegetable broth at this location. It wasn't very busy there. We left and went somewhere else down the street, it was almost twice as much, but we didn't care, we got what we wanted. I don't like the attitude of these kids who work for their families or friends. They just want to play on the computer or chat to their friends and it's like you're bothering them by coming in and ordering food. I thought I love the Than bros pho until I started at this location. Its by far the worst I've had and can't even be called pho. I tried to be fair and gave them three last chances to keep me as a customer but everytime I came here the broth is so salty, it doesn't even smell or taste like pho made with the homemade broth recipe of star anise, cinnamon, cloves, etc. And they give you such skimpy portions of the meat and noodles. The service is horrible. I think they are just using the Than Brothers name to get customers in but no way are they any good as the other locations. I'd rather take my business to Pho Viet Anh up the street and pay more money for real homemade pho. Bleh! i ate here a ton when i was pregnant but that was only for the craving of pho and they are within walking distance. The Queen Anne location is sorta dirty, with somewhat rude staff, and they wear open toed flip flops that are against health code. But it's cheap... I ate pho for the first time here and while I did enjoy my food the service was awful! My friend had to ask the waiter three times for his lemonade and several tables had dirty dishes on them the whole time I was there. &#160;I could hear the guys talking in the back and it wasnt busy so there was really no excuse. &#160;And the server was wearing flip flops which is kind of gross and against health codes. &#160;I didn't get sick and found nothing alarming in my food but I'm hoping the kitchen was up to code!
Yes wait is long, butI loves me some Oaxacayummy in tummy Food was pretty good, but holy crap expensive for the serving size. &#160;I hate going to places to eat and leave hungry. We waited for ever to get in. &#160;But we were excited about this place and decided to deal with it.Once seated we got waters right away and gave a drink order. &#160;Once the drinks arrived we had to wait for over 30 minutes to place our order with the waiter. &#160;Once we did the food arrived in a timely matter. &#160;However the plates were soooo small and there was so little food that we had to order more. &#160;That took another 20 minutes. &#160;No wonder there is such a line to get in, everyones dining experience takes welll over an hour.In the end I was still hungry so we left to grab an appetizer somewhere else. &#160;The food was good and the Mole was great, but come on, give a little more rice or something.There are plenty more better Mexican places to eat than this place. I went to Oaxaca for a week, and stuffed my face silly with the delicious cheeses and complex mole sauces. When I found out there was a Oaxacan restaurant in Ballard, I had to go. They just about nailed it. The most significant missing item on Carta's menu are the chapulines, fried grasshoppers with chile and lime that come with nearly everything you try and order in Oaxaca. Thanks for the omission Carta!My only qualms about this restaurant are that it doesn't have a larger bar or a better atmosphere. This restaurant nails the basics, but a romantic dinner or a scinillating conversation is almost out of the question, thanks to a rather harried and loud setting.Oh well, this place is fabulous. Check it out, then fly to Oaxaca and try the real thing. Best Mexican in Seattle! &#160;The wait is worth it. &#160;Servings are a little smaller than most Mexican places so be sure to get plenty of chips and salsa (the guacamole is delicious). I'm from so Cal so I have pretty high standards for Mexican food. This place has my stamp approval. Went there with my friend Tim had a couple of margaritas to whet my appetite. 40 minutes later we were finally seated in the bar section overlooking the kitchen. You can watch the Oaxacan women make fresh tortillas. We ordered, food arrived and literally did not talk through our meal. That is how good it is. Enough said. Stop reading this and GO!
I really enjoyed this place! It certainly wasn't a replacement for the taquerias I miss in California, but I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner here. The decor is very beautiful and tasteful. The walls are covered almost completely with wonderful framed photographs. The portions were a bit smaller than expected, but that really means you can have chips and some of their great salsas from the salsa bar, an entree, and dessert and not feel overstuffed. We really like this place, read below on the eats, I agree. &#160;My one suggestion would be to check this place out at lunch if possible. &#160;Dinner-time is PACKED! &#160;It is a nice place for lunch too because of the small tapa-like sizes, you won't overeat.The best mexican place we have found in Seattle for sure.Don't go here at night with a romantic date, its very loud, more fun with a group of friends. This place ROCKS! &#160;I stood in line and it was definitely worth it. &#160;I don't think I've ever had better Mexican food than here! &#160;Everyone that waited on us was so gracious and kind and the food was fantastic! &#160;I didn't want to leave, however there was a huge line outside waiting!!I will definitely be back!!! I'm not so sure I'd call this "authentic" mexican food; rather it's fresh and gourmet. &#160;As mentioned, definately get there before 7 - we went 6:30 on a Tuesday and still had to wait a couple minutes for a table. &#160;It's pretty easy to figure out your order, as there's only 20 dishes offered. &#160;Jonathan made a great call on the Mole - wow!Oh, and don't forget the $3 chips and guac. &#160;The salsa bar is a disappointment, but the chips are the best I've ever had. &#160;Also make sure to get a Magrarita, which is big and not overly sweet. &#160;They don't provide water unless asked. Food is totally awesome. The helpings are not very big, like other mexican restaurants i have been to.Varities of salsas to choose from.But, this may sound a lil weird...we spotted a coupla waiters dipping the straw into the drinks and tasting it before serving ...and no, they din't put the straw back in the drink :) But how many of us would like our drinks being sipped by the waiter?Otherwise, it's the best mexican restaurant i have been to! Great for sampling several different dishes and one of the few places in Seattle that serves tacos al pastor.Get there early or be prepared to wait. &#160;Also be prepared to sit close to your neighbors. I love this restaurant so much I chose to celebrate my birthday here with a group of friends. &#160;The funny thing is that whenever we come here it feels like we're trying to get into an elite night club! &#160;This place is buzzing and for good reason. &#160;The food is excellent! &#160;But there's a catch: the wait can take 30 to over 60 minutes and they take no reservations :( &#160;Some of my favorite dishes include the Albondiga soup (just like Mom makes), Tacos al Pastor &#160;(to die for), Pozole (with a red broth), Entomatadas (a dish I personally make the most at home; this one comes with a bonus side of delicious carne asada not mentioned in the menu) and finally the Birria (meat is cooked perfectly). &#160;Another thing I like about it is that you really get what you pay for in terms of proportion that's why it's relatively inexpensive and the reason we stock up on food. &#160;By the time all our food arrives we're bound to have a real Mexican feast! **Update 7/2007**Other than the fresh homemade tortillas and the albondigas,which I can make just as well at home,the food here is not special enough to warrant the wait or the price.I guess Seattlites are so hard up for good Mexican food, they think this is the !dios mio! version of the holy grail, which it is not.Go to Senor Moose and have almost anything - especially the moles - which are authentic and excellent, and their guacamole is better and a much better deal.If you're the type who must be at THE newest, &#160;trendiest spot - then this is your place.__________________"muy bueno"They do Lunch now!I could not &#160;*believe* I was gonna miss La Carta on my latest city trip, so I called, even though Yelp says they open at 5. Even though their website says so too.Liars.Open! Yea!albondigas - as good as homemeade. really. so goodtacos al pastor - mmm mmm, porky yummy goodtortillas - hey! &#160;is my tia in the kitchen!?hibiscus aqua fresca - too sweet, didn't seem fresca to me.going back tomorrow ... wonder if i can get albondigas by the gallon?TWO DAYS LATER:Slurp slurp slurp -mmm albondigas... slurp slurpTortillas. She's not my tia, but someone's tia is back there cranking out those tortillas. Dios mio, what a busy lady!Mole. &#160;Complex, spicy and chocolatey like its supposed to be.Go get some. Now. Before I eat it all up. They don't call it La Carta *Oaxaca* &#160;fer nuthin'Burp ... ahhhh This place is a far cry from the droopy cheese laden soggy tortilla nightmare I call Mama's...its worth it for a trip just to watch the gaggle of 4' tall mexican ladies making the tortillas near the salsa bar...and the salsa bar! I love fresh chips...and sampling all those salsas can make you so full you wont have room for dinner if youre not careful. If you like mole, you wont be disappointed. And so cheap!The decor and environment make it a fun place to go. Be prepared to wait, but the last few times I've been there I haven't had to, even with a group of 8. Ayy, SABOR! watch the senoras prepare your (delicious, reeealy delicious) food in this cantina setting. The photography and the lighting is not welcoming from outside, and it's loud, but once you are eating you are in heaven. &#160;Beef entomatadas make any taco bus look like taco bell, and for less than $10! &#160;Also try the pork mole. &#160;You may have to wait over an hour, but if you do the math, it has to be worth it (there are other places to eat in Ballard, so if the wait was "too long" people wouldn't be there to make the list that long, get it?), and besides, Mary assured me she wouldn't take me to a place that wasn't good. Fresh tortillas, &#160;and real oaxaqueno cheese (no cheddar here).There is an unusual custom here of seating groups of 3 or 4 with other strangers on a big table, so be prepared to eat next to someone you don't know. Good sushi in Seattle? Check...Good Dim Sum in Seattle? Check...Good Mexican in Seattle? FINALLY!Yelp has saved the day. Coming from the Bay Area I was deathly afraid that I would find no decent Mexican food up here. Everyone I spoke with confirmed my fears. I started to have nightmares and endless bouts of depression.But, no longer! La Cara de Oaxaca is the place to go for Oaxacan-style Mexican food. Now, if you're looking for the Cali-style "fresh-Mex", this place is not for you. Here, they specialize in moles and the like.First, start out with awesome homemade chips and their salsa bar. They have so many different kinds, each one punchy and delicious. &#160;The red chile salsa is dark, hot and smoky. The pico de gallo style is wondiferously fresh and spicy. Yum times two.Next, we had both the al pastor and the pork mole. The mole was dark and sweet. I mixed some of the red chile salsa in and it was fantastic. The al pastor was citrusy and different than I'm used to, but still damn good.Also, if your walking there, try their fantastic selection of mezcal, it's served with a slice of lime and a slice of chile lime. Ooh, nice!Finally, the deserts are great too. We had the flan and the sweet tamale with ice cream. Oh, goodness. I've never had a sweet tamale, but it was so good. It has raisins it in and is served hot with ice cream and pineapple. Oh sweet succulent corn, why do you tempt me with your tastiness?!The decor of the place kicks butt too. It gets pretty crowded as the swanky folks start dropping in, but we had no trouble getting a table around 6pm. Check it out. If there is a home-style Mexican cooking all powerful being, I think s/he calls La Carta home. I used to think I knew good Mexican food... I finally discovered what GREAT Mexican food was. And dammit, the place is only a few minutes drive from my house! Visited for the first time tonight. Arrived as it opened and within 10 minutes the entire place was full. Patrons waiting to get in are civil and organized enough to form a waiting line outside the door awaiting their turn as full bellied customers leave.Definitely start your meal with the chips and fresh guacamole. This coming from someone who never understood the attachment that some people have to the smooshy green fruit. I've been craving that dip all night since we left. Margaritas were a little heavy on the salt, but alcohol is alcohol is alcohol right? From there my short little friend and I shared #19 and #20 from the menu - Entomatadas &amp; Lamb Birria. Personally, I thought the lamb was a smidgen on the dry side. Still flavorful, but could definitely use a little more of that sauce. The Entomatada was perfecto. I could probably eat that all night until my heart gave way or the chair legs buckled underneath me.We passed on dessert - only because we were both too full to continue. Customer service was outstanding, the best that I have ever had (if I have ever been quoted saying those same words in a different review, someone please strike said comments and reference La Carta from now on). Despite being seated somewhat off to the side and in the corner behind the large family table, someone was always checking to see if we needed anything else (dip, tortilla shells, refills, etc). We'll probably be here all next week for dinner. We usually end up hitting every item on the menu on various days before we move on. It's too bad Yelp doesn't accept video uploads, I had a small clip of how my dear friend hogged all food ;) Screw you Texas! I don't need you and your delicious Mexican food anymore! No longer will you have a hold on me now that I've found La Carta de Oaxaca! I think I giggled with delight through my entire meal. Each time they brought out a plate I kept thinking I had finally found a place that got it! A place that uses real Mexican cheese. I would do bad things for Mexican cheese. Their margarita was hands down the best margarita I have had in Seattle. Get it on the rocks and with salt, do anything else and I will snag your place in line, cause damn it's crowded, and you have clearly proven you do not belong here with your sham of a drink order.Some people recommend going early so you don't have to wait. I think I would rather wait than deal with the 15 families with small children they had crammed in here at 5:00. It's just creepy when a kindergartner wanders over to stare at your food and no one says anything.No longer can people start a review with "Well, I'm from Texas so I know what Mexican food should taste like..." Now we have our very own fabulous Mexican food.Deep in the heart of Washington! Yeehaw! This place was packed on a Tuesday night - a good sign. &#160;Thankfully, we arrived just before the rush of the crowd. &#160;I like the idea of the community table that functions as the restaurant's centerpiece. &#160;You feel like you're eating in somebody's gourmet kitchen - perhaps that of a wealthy Oaxacan family.To start out, we ordered a round of margaritas. &#160;They were sweet and easy to down, but not exactly strong. &#160;Mom would approve. &#160;Perhaps I've just become a heavyweight in recent weeks.We coupled our margaritas with some very fresh chips and some smooth, easy to eat, guacamole. &#160;Each of us then ordered another plate. &#160;One friend ordered the Pozole - a pork and hominy soup. &#160;The hotness of the spice in the broth overpowered all other flavors for me, but I liked the not too tough, but not too mushy texture.My other dining companion ordered the tacos al pastor, which were also overpowered by a hot spice, not allowing the natural flavor of the pork seep through.I ordered a tamale con mole, beautifully wrapped in a banana leaf, which when unwrapped seemed to take up half of our table. &#160;The tamale itself was prepared with very sweet cornmeal, and the sweetness of the mole sauce made this even more dessert-like. As I prefer to eat smaller portions for dinner, the appetizer sizes of the dishes worked for me. After hearing and reading so much praise for Oaxaca, and then waiting an hour for a table, I was excited when we finally sat down. &#160;Despite having my head bumped every three minutes by traffic going by, I was still optimistic. &#160;But when my enchiladas finally arrived, and they were really, really sweet (not authentic sweet, dessert sweet), the honeymoon was over. &#160;I asked the waiter if they were supposed to be that way (nicely, of course), just to make sure I hadn't gotten part of a rogue batch. &#160;They were almost inedible, and I am no picky eater. &#160;I really felt like crying. &#160;I am a true slave to my blood sugar, so it was a big ol' disappointment - I didn't feel anything but sadness. &#160;But our waiter was really cute, and I enjoyed the margaritas (strong and delicious at the same time) very much during the hour long wait in the teeny, tiny, very small bar (where I had my head in a stranger's armpit. &#160;Luckily, there was a straw in my marg). This is quality Mexican food. &#160;There is a reason there is a wait, and that does stop me from going more often, but it is FANTASTIC.For people who like authentic Mexican food...My mouth is watering.I just noticed Krissi's addition to the reviews....I may have to come up with a list of unwritten...soon to be written rules in regards to reviewing.Vegetarians going to an authentic Mexican restaurant expecting to be catered to is the equivalent of a Carnivitarian going to Carmelita expecting them to have beef/chicken/meat on hand.La Carta is the best Mexican food in Seattle...bar none. &#160;Even if your experience isn't full fledge vegetarian why give them one star? I don't know how one reviewer could question the "authenticity" of La Carta de Oaxaca. &#160;The brothers that run it are from Oaxaca. &#160;The menu was created by their mother. &#160;Most, if not all, of the kitchen staff is from Oaxaca. &#160;This is like no other Mexican restaurant in Seattle. &#160;It's nice to finally have an authentic regional Mexican restaurant here. &#160;The location is small, and filled with family style tables. The walls are covered with wonderful photos of Oaxaca by local photographer Spike Mafford that can distract anyone from a good conversation, or &#160;spark one, even. La Carta's staff is friendly and accommodating. The menu is filled with extremely flavorful dishes that are a bit on the smaller side. &#160;The prices are quite reasonable. It's a refreshing change from the more common Mexican restaurants that are inexplicably expensive and pile so much mediocre food on a plate that it's overwhelming. I usually get by with an order of chips and guacamole and my main dish (plus a margarita and flan to share). &#160;If you're really hungry order two main dishes. &#160;Even though I've enjoyed everything I've tried, the Tamales de Mole Negro (#14) is by far my most favorite item on the menu. &#160;Be sure to arrive within 15 minutes of opening to avoid a wait. &#160;Arriving at prime dinner time can have you waiting upwards of an hour; it's worth it. They're also open for lunch now, and I've found it to be much less crowded then. I have to mention (like I always do, in band camp-esque mind numbing repetition) that I am from Phoenix, Arizona. And that is near...you guessed it. Mexico. In high school and college the late night eats were found in the central city "authentic" joints where you placed your order in Spanish. So, that's what I'm used to.Now I live in Seattle. I spent the first year and a half scouring the city for authenticity in Mexican food. Something spicy. Fresh guacamole. Street-style carne asada tacos. And folks, it's all here at Oaxaca with an extra added feature...ambiance.Now don't you dare go there...I want to be able to get a seat a few times a week without you people making me wait!EDIT: I saw that someone below said that Oaxaca is expensive. WTF? What did they order? My boyfriend and I routinely get out of there for $15 before tip!! Both of our entrees are $5 and we get sodas. I guess if you drink a lot of margaritas the bill would be high, but otherwise this is one of the best, most inexpensive meals in Seattle. I promise! Yeah, I'm gonna blatantly pile on this. Best Mexican I've had. Excellent mole, margaritas &amp; atmosphere.However - my (now ex) anti-carnivorous gf was limited to the two (small) seafood plates on the menu, so be ready for the meat. Then enjoy it immensely. This is easily the best regional Mexican food to be found in Seattle. Many of the employees originate from Oaxaca, the tortillas are handmade, and the salsas are artesian and complex spicewise. The portions are small, but inexpensive. Oh, and the mole... it cannot be topped.Dinner hours only, and lines do form, but I could not speak poorly of the place. Ballard has a lot going for it, and this is just one example. Que rico!! The wait for a table generally sucks, but the food is 100% authentic and homemade and incredible. They even make their tortillas by hand (you can watch them make 'em while you wait for your table ;). A few secrets to getting in:1) Be there at 5p on the dot.2) They serve food late -- I think till midnight! So if you're checking out a show at the Sunset or bar-hopping in Ballard, come by after 9p and you will likely walk right in.3) Lunch! They just starting serving midday, if you're a lady (or gent) of leisure.It's so worth it! In a word: YUM!We waited about 30 minutes for a table, which ended up being two seats at the counter overlooking the kitchen. And what a view: All of the tortillas were being made to order; the all-female cooks were moving fast but deliberately to get their food out to the noisy Friday-night crowd. We were conveniently close to the salsa bar, which had 5 or 6 freshly-made sauces.We started with guacamole and chips; the guac was on the creamy (as opposed to chunky) side, but tasty; the chips were fried to order. We moved on to picaditas -- sort of a mini pizza of grilled tortilla with a smear of porky black beans, cheese crumbles, and drizzled sauces-- and molotes, which were a bit like potato-and-chorizo-filled taquitos.We ordered a pork tamal with black mole steamed in banana leaf, but got chicken instead. Even with chicken, it was delicious; I can only imagine how amazing it would be with pork instead! wub.gif The chile relleno -- which we ordered with cheese filling --was perfectly battered and properly cooked. Though it lacked sauce, I would still vote it one of the best I have ever eaten. My only wish was that it would have been bigger. Like all of their plates, it was just a few tantalizing bites.Black beans in varying stages of thickness and smoothness made appearances throughout the meal. On the picaditas, they were blended with smoky lard, and used as a sort of sauce. One of the larger dishes came with a small ramekin of mostly-whole beans topped with shredded dry cheese, and the other came with a pool of saucy, partially-smashed ones.The food was very authentic, startlingly fresh, and entirely worth the wait. At under $50 (including tax, tip, and 4 bottles of mexican beer), it was also a stunning deal. The service was welcoming and friendly, despite the crowd of people. The decor was fun without going over the top into Latin kitsch. Amazing (and spicy) fish tacos. Great guac. Love this place! Best hand made tortillas in Seattle, hands down. &#160;Mexican food that tastes, well, Mexican. &#160;Takes me back to those great, simple, Yucatecan meals on warm Caribbean nights. What hasn't &#160;been said about this restaurant? It is always delicious, fresh uncomlicated food, great beer and very nice margaritas. The decor is lovely black and white photos and the staff is fantastic, and fun even when the place is packed, which is always! Very tasty salsa bar and yummy guacamole. &#160;We usually choose 3 small entrees to share and have out server pick the 4th, the servers pick is always the best :) A great place to take an out of town guest. This place was packed last night. We stood squeezed against the bar in the back, &#160;and for forty-five minutes I sucked on the straw in my delightfully-sour margarita while trying to ignore the stink eye I was getting from two women who sat on the stools next to my corner, attempting to have a private conversation. (Where would you have liked me to go ladies? The place was freaking packed. And yes, red-headed, leather jacket lady: you should definitely break up with him. He obviously isn't the one.)We were finally seated at the big cafetera -style table in the front, sharing the space with what seemed like a super-fun birthday celebration. But the waiting, the sharing, and the stink eye were all forgotten when the food came: home-made chips with supercreamy guac, a mole the likes of which I've never tasted north of the border, chile rellenos that melted in the mouth, perfect queso blanco. Forget the birthday party, the fiesta in my mouth was the only one that mattered.Brings new meaning to the words "worth the wait." Food is EXCELLENT. I have a Mexican friend who barely speaks English and is only here for a year to study English... I took her out here on a date and she said the dishes taste like home... very authentic, etc. The tamales is like nothing I've had before.Plenty of self-serve salsa for your chips. The portions are small, not so you eat less but so you order more. They recommend three dishes for every couple. This lets you try more stuff! I loved the black mole and the Entomotadas, thin tender grilled steak with Tomatillo sauce. There are lots of photos all over the place, and the signature huge photo of a southern Mexican man grimacing at you. Yes, we got the chips and guac and margaritas and yes, you should too! the boy and i finally ventured out to Ballard to check this place out. i've been craving &#160;good authentic Mexican food in Washington and this is the very closest i can find thus far.the wait wasn't too bad for a Tuesday night at about 7ish. it was packed and waited for about 15 minutes.  my first trying a mole dish and i liked it very much. the boy thought it was just a bit too sweet (he said it tasted like bar.b.q sauce). the portion was perfect! i also had the tacos al pastor (bar.b.q'ed pork in tortilla) and it was okay. too spicy for me though. he had the quesadilla fritas - looked pretty fancy but it wasn't outrageously great...tasted like a regular cheese quesadilla (perfect for the little ones) and he also had the entomatadas (grilled thin slice beef w/tortillas, tomatilla sauce, cheese, and crema mexicana) which was my favorite dish out of all of them. perfectly flavored grilled beef! so delish! we also had hot out of the oven (or fryer?) chips and the fresh guacamole...very yummy!he says it was just too crowded for him (not into the hustle and bustle atmosphere) and the food was just mediocre. he wouldn't come again but if i wanted to, he would (aww). &#160;so i guess you'll see us there again. i liked the place and i esp. like the portion sizes...a few goes a long way! the staff were very friendly &amp; polite despite the multitude of people in such a small space. you know i was really leaning towards the 3.5 stars.this place is cute and i really never go to ballard --- ever. (is there anything there besides the locks?). a small but not too cramped restaurant, picture frames line the walls and make this place seem cool yet simple.the service here was pretty good, they were very friendly and always assisted us with a smile. in my group we probably ordered atleast 4x. (our food, 2nd order of food, margaritas, more bread, etc.) it was a very busy friday night and it was a few different people helping us. in a way this was different (then normally have one server) - but they never once got confused on who/what left off where.the food was pretty good. mexican like i've never had it. overall the food content was good but there wasn't a wow factor to it. which is why i would have taken off the 1/2 star if we had 1/2 stars. i had a #19 (?) which was pretty good - i'd probably order it again if i went again.the thing i like and don't like about this place (in one!) is the small portions. i love it because i can never choose one thing to eat, i like having a variety, but i don't like it because you end up paying a lot more than you're used to. although the small plates range from $5 to $10 or so, if you go when you're hungry you can mos def dent your pocket.randoms: - its mostly street parking unless you wanna pay for a lot (so it'll take forever to park!)- come early @ like 5pm because the lines for dinner can get crazy!- when it gets busy you might be forced to share a table w/ another partyps. the chips are good and a salsa bar is offered in the middle of the restaurant.two plates + margarita = $30. Really good food...but why do they have to charge so much? I love mexican food....maybe cause I am mexican. Glad to see I can find some really good food that reminds me of home. The service was great just didn't dig how pricey the place is. I spent over $20 bucks just on myself that's alot in my book. I come from a city where a $20 mexican dinner will feed 2 people easily...with drinks. Even with the high prices I am still going back....what can I say....I love mexican food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Being from New Mexico, I have a complete appreciation (addiction?) for quality Mexican food. And I have to say, as far as the offerings in Seattle go - this is one of the best! And don't go in there without trying one of their kick-ass margaritas too! Try the Entomatadas. Absolutely incredible. They are to Mexican food what Con Te Partiro is to opera. What I dig about this joint is that you get stellar food at a reasonable price, and a crackin good atmosphere with great photography on the walls. The wait is brutal, but even my parents were up for it when they visited me this summer in Seattle. I've been an aficionado of Mexican food for years, from Diego to the Bay, the city is the bomb... Cut. This place is solid, save for the wait. The menu consists of about 15 small dishes. Everything that was ordered was top notch. Great food, great atmosphere, and lots of tequila. I love the huge photos on the walls and the fact that the waiter bluntly told me friend "no, we don't make mojitos" Another great Yelp discovery! &#160;I wandered into La Carta de Oaxaca during the day to avoid the dinner madness proclaimed by other Yelpers. &#160;Upon entering La Carta de Oaxaca, I noticed the great collection of mostly black and white photography decorating the walls which is primarily Mexican inspired and a wonderful addition to the surroundings. &#160;Much to my dismay, chips were not initially served, but the dismay turned to delight when I realized the cause of the delay - the chips are freshly made for each table. &#160;SO, if you realize that you are munching through chips like a monkey does with bananas, be sure to ask the server for another basket because it will take a few minutes for them to appear. &#160;I ordered the Tacos Fritos (two chicken and one beef); the combination of the sauces over the top and the crunchy rolled tortillas was great. &#160;Next time around, I'm going for the mole which one of my friends ordered - it was scrumptious! &#160;The bar for good Mexican food in Seattle is set rather low in my mind, but La Carta de Oaxaca easily clears the hurdle! chirpy - that is standard industry practice and happens at EVERY restaurant and bar. &#160;the waiters are tasting the drink - in a sanitary manner - to make sure that it came out right. &#160;they're not stealing sips of your beverage - they're trying to make sure that you get the perfect cocktail that you ordered. &#160;just like the cook in the kitchen will dip a clean spoon into a sauce and taste it to make sure that it's right.now to the review - la carta de oaxaca is amazing. &#160;go there. &#160;the portion size is a BONUS meaning you can order a wider variety and try more things!
What is Rancho Bravo you ask? Well, let me tell you. Rancho Bravo is a taco truck transplanted into a shut down Kentucky Fried Chicken. Do not let this trashy chic decor fool you. Yes, the service is fast. But is it fast food? That's debatable. It's just so damn good, I can't put it in the same food family as McDonald's and Taco Bell. They really aren't sisters. Maybe if Rancho Bravo is Cinderella, and McD and TB are the ugly step sisters. Then, maybe, can you call Rancho fast food. I recommend: Chicken Taquitos (they're fresh, come on a bed of lettuce with cheese and tomatoes) Bravo Burrito (with either mole chicken or spicy pork) Any of their tacos Horchata (you have to try this rice drink) I was thrilled when Rancho Bravo took over the ill placed KFC on Cap Hill. The price point is the same, the interior is the same but the food is a whole lot better!My first time eating at Rancho Bravo was after a night of cocktails and it was an interesting experience. The post bar crowd inside becomes a melting pot of all the clubs in the surrounding blocks and you know that moment when the bar you're hanging out in throws up the lights and tells you to GTFO? And you realize you're not looking as flawless as you had thought and you might be a total mess? Well, thanks to the harsh unforgiving lighting and bare bones fast food interior, Rancho Bravo makes sure you don't forget it!But onto the important stuff: FOODIs it authentic? Real? I mean like really real, I grew up in the slums of Guadalajara so I know what REAL Mexican food is, Mexican food? Hell if I know. But I think it's awesome. Simple preparations, delicious salsas, Mexican soda with real sugar, works for me! The location is peculiar, resembling a famous fast-food establishment reminiscent of McDonald's. The interior has not changed from the seating, to the fountain soda machines. The only noticeable differences is that the burger machines have been removed so it is an open layout kitchen that you can watch the staff prepare your meals. The only other notable difference is the tacky laminated banner serving as the menu above the cash register. The drive-thru lane is packed with cars bumper to bumper, which I'm guessing is used for the staff. Beyond that, Rancho Bravo has converted into a Mexican quasi fast food restaurant serving tacos, tamales, soups, burritos, quesadillas, enchiladas, and more. After being somewhat letdown from the tacos at Marination Station, it was suggested that I try some authentic tacos at Rancho Bravo. Not feeling completely full, I gladly accepted the invitation. The ambiance is very questionable, as there are dishes, trays and random stuff laid all over the countertops in the kitchen. It doesn't exactly denote the most organized or clean environment. You can almost expect to feel a little dirty walking in there. But sometimes a little dirtiness is a good thing.I decided to go for two tacos. Each taco was served on two corn tortillas, choice of meat, a generous portion of cilantro leaves, diced onions, a thin slice of radish, and a lime wedge:- Spicy Pork Taco ($2.10) - The spicy pork had a nice seasoned glaze and char to it, making for a very tasty taco. I was afraid the dryness from the two corn tortillas were going to take away from the flavor, but they used a less starchy tortilla that made all the difference. The generous serving of fresh cilantro and diced onions made a simplistic taco, quite tasty. Steak Taco ($2.10) - The steak meat was sliced intro strips, with a decent marinade and subtle char while maintaining a tenderness, without overcooking the meat. The meat was not too fatty nor grisly, which made for a decent taco, but I was not overly impressed.If you're adventurous enough to try the different sauces from the bottles, the green hot sauce is very good, accentuating to the flavor of the tacos without too much heat. But if heat is what you're looking for, try the red hot sauce, which is much spicier. I'd take it easy at first and see if you can handle the heat before going crazy on this sauce.Rancho Bravo serves some tasty tacos and I can definitely see myself returning. I can also imagine this being the perfect spot for a late night snack or after a heavy evening of drinking, which may partly explain why the establishment is so dirty. I can say that I survived through my two tacos, and I was equally satisfied enough to warrant a return visit to try Rancho Bravo's other offerings. I have always enjoyed swinging into Rancho Bravo in the past when I am in the neighborhood, however, today I had a less than stellar experience. Order was pretty simple, just a chicken bowl with black beans and cheese, but no cilantro, tomato or onion, and the order was verbally confirmed with me. Upon my arrival to my office - all the omitted items were in the bowl, and there was no cheese. I took the order back, and the employee behind the counter gave me a real dirty look, and I did not even get an apology for the order being prepared incorrectly. That really rubbed me the wrong way. Rancho Bravo is heaven on earth! The burritos, tamales, and taquitos are excellent! They are open super late on weekends and pretty late on weekdays. If you go to Capitol Hill you HAVE to try this amazing Mexican food. Don't forget the dark green (medium) salsa/hot sauce!!!!! It took until I got all the way home to realize that my side order of guacamole was missing. But it didn't take that long for me to forgive. The torta was so delicious that I actually took pause, ogled it admiringly and thanked Rancho Bravo out loud. If I could only change one thing, I'd like for fresh jalapenos instead of what looked suspiciously like canned/jarred. Would make all the difference. I was skeptical of this little restaurant, with it's shut down drive-thru and the fast food decor. But they've managed to keep the food delicious AND fast. Very reasonable prices.While I was in line, a very mall little girl came up to the counter with a $10 bill and ordered a plain quesadilla. The man at the register asked her if she wanted a small or a large, to which she continued to respond with "Plain." He was super patient with her, bent over the counter so that he was talking more ta her level, and I liked that he wouldn't just take her order for whatever ol' size and snatch up that $10.I'll probably have fantasies about that torta. So I'll be back. The burritos are delicious, but everything here is hit or miss. I have never had anything that wasn't wonderful, but some people there make better burritos than others and you would have to go there often enough to know who to look for.The Mexican cokes and sauces in the front counter make picking up food or getting more little sauces very difficult because it is always busy and people just stand in the way with no consideration of the others around them.I wouldn't bring children or older relatives here, but I come here multiple times a week. Corn on a stick with mayo and chili powder! &#160;Actually doesn't suck. Rancho Brave on Cap Hill has the BEST Veggie tacos!! However, you may have to wait in line for quite a while if it is busy, which it usually is. Two tacos fills me up and leaves me feeling very happy! Highly recommended! Cheap and tasty. &#160;I really should just end this review here, because that's pretty much what this place is all about, as others have attested.No ambiance whatsoever, but you can eat outside. &#160;All pluses, especially if it's nice out. But, if it's nice out, why on earth are you sitting outside this joint? Just grab 5 things of salsa, 20 napkins and go eat in the park! I didn't know good little taquerias existed outside of California. I'm excited to see from my experience that the phenomenon is spreading up the west coast!Rancho Bravo is humble to look at (but clean), however it packs a big punch in flavor, for a low low price. I had a tamale, taco, and a soda, which all left me full, satisfied and barely out $5. if I could get a big meal for this little in SF, I would be a very happy camper.The restaurant has a nice view of a park across the way, and the food workers at the counter went out of their way to be nice and quick. if I lived in Seattle, I could see Rancho Bravo being a regular stop for me. not good. true, maybe i did have high expectations, as a local told me these were the second-best tacos in north america with the first being somewhere is mexico. however, i always take a pretentious statement like that with a grain of salt, so i did not actually have super-high expectations.no, this place was just not that good. i got steak tacos and a chicken tamale (they were out of pork). the tacos were mediocre at best. they were kind of dry and greasy at the same time, and not in a good way. though the meat was portion was generous and the radish was a nice touch that you don't always get.the tamales were a huge disappointment. they were just dry and the corn flavor was very shallow and not rich like a very good tamale should be.this place was really cheap though... but i've had lots of fantastic tacos and tamales at really cheap places, so i don't know if that's really a point for it. i really wanted to like this place but i just couldn't. Best taco stand in Seattle. &#160;It is inside of a converted KFC, which makes for a wonky counter line (especially since so few people in Seattle have the brains to queue correctly) and it suffers from the homeless teen situation across the street at Cal Anderson, but the food is consistently great. &#160;The burritos are the best in the city and reasonably priced. Docking 1 star -- while it's awesome they went with the compostable paper plates and bowls, now the bowls (I always get carnitas) spread out all the food and it is cold by the time you get it. The terrible old styrofoam bowls were actually bowls so they stayed hot at least. Now the "bowls" are served on paper plates and the food gets cold. If they don't fix that by heating it up a little extra before serving, I guess I'll get it in burrito form so that at least it's all bundled up and doesn't lose all its heat. I really hate cold food so this was a bummer. Who Let the Farts out?Who, who, who, who, who?Who Let the Farts out?Who, who, who, who, who?Well, the food taste good, the service was fast. &#160;Prices are cheap.Convenient Location but very ghetto inside.Converted Jack n Box. Salsa on the floor.Ordered:NACHOS - Great flavorful meat, yummy melted cheese, jalapeno, sour cream, black beans, and tasty toasted chips! Only thing missing is some fresh guacamole. http://www.yelp.com/biz_&#8230;QUESADILLA - My daughter like it...straight grubbing! Who doesn't like melted cheese? http://www.yelp.com/biz_&#8230;CHICKEN TAQUITO - Crispy shell, nice favor chicken and fresh veggies of greens plus fresh tomatoes. &#160;http://www.yelp.com/biz_&#8230;But someone letting out the farts! I heard Farts. Voot. Stanky!Who Let the Farts out?Who, who, who, who, who?We took our food on the go....you should do the same! 3.5 Stars. This place is go-to for cheap mexican food in Capitol HIll. I was getting sick of paying $10-12 for a fucking burrito. Now I have my place! I always passed this restaurant wondering what they were serving because it was always bumpin. Their food is delicious and did I mention cheap? The way quick Mexican food should be? I can't believe they don't have a sign anywhere in view from the street. They would get even MORE people, I think, if they advertised better. FWIW I had the nachos and it was MASSIVE for $4.95. YES. Oh, and they don't have beer... *yet*. Apparently it's 'coming soon'. Amazingly good, cheap, fast mexican food! The burritos are my fave, but the tacos, burrito bowls, and tamales are all top notch. Great salsa assortment. Always great friendly and quick service from all the staff. My only complaint is that I always get my food to go as the inside of the restaurant always looks slightly dirty (floors especially) and because of this I'm not so excited to eat in that atmosphere.But besides that A+! It place is for realz. Food was always fantastic here. If you're looking for a fancy dinner, you probably won't notice this place. But, a quick dinner before/after soccer...or whatever else that you do. Yes, please! I love their tacos, their burritos, and tamales. They never disappoint. So wonderful. My husband and I love this place. The price is right. Loooove this place! A friend just recently introduced me to the place, and I've become a fan/addict of this place after one time! The food is delicious, cheap and very fast! The employees are friendly and always happy to serve.I usually hate Mexican food because I can't stand the smell of stir fried bell peppers but all I smell after leaving this place is delicious meats. (I guess if you're a vegetarian, then you might not agree with me). The meat smell isn't that a gross greasy smell, it just smells like deliciousness!However, one time I did get a way over salted quesadilla, I couldn't even finish it, and even my sister a super salty eater commented that it was wayyyy to salty. Other that that one episode, I've had a great experience with this place and plan to come here whenever I'm in the area! :D Based on the pictures, Rancho Bravo seems to have changed a lot since I've last been there [years ago].At the time, it was just an extremely ghetto looking establishment in a blatantly hollowed out KFC (or was it Burger King?); the kind of place that had banners covering up the lettering, and the former establishment's colors still intact. Now look at it, legitimate and everything.And if the food hasn't changed from fresh and cheap, it's likely one of the best tasting burrito/taco joints in Seattle. &#160;3 types of freshly made sauces, the servings of beef tongue. &#160;In a town where ethnic food comes to die (by mediocrity), Rancho Bravo stands out. As someone who once had the taste of Southern Caliornia Mexican food on their lips I never thought anywhere in Seattle would compare. I can't tell you how many times I walked by this place when it was a KFC. Barf. Then one glorious day it's as if God knew Capitol Hill was ready for real Mexican food. &#160;Sure it's a little rough on the outside but it's the inside that counts. Dear Rancho Bravo,Thank you for treating my taste buds as if I were the only one. Everything on your menu tickles my fancy. Tacos, tamales, burritos, OH MY. Whether drunk or sober you are simply glorious. I love you.KTO Must try the chicken mole burrito. I love this place. It's the place where I learned that I might actually like tomatoes a little bit. This is also the first place I tried horchata, which I can now say that I totally love.The food is ready super fast. I think their meat is well seasoned and well cooked, and while their flavors are pretty simple, they come together for really effective meals. Normally I get the Bravo burrito, and it's a nice size, not too big, not too small. I've also had a chicken quesadilla and it tasted great! One complaint- usually the burrito is only about half folded once I open the foil and I'm left holding a gloppy mess of black beans and cheese at the end. I won't even take a star away for that, though, because I really really really like the food. As a native Southern Californian, I am VERY picky about my Mexican food. &#160;I've had some sad excuses of it courtesy of Taco Time and Taco Del Mar. &#160;Then I found this place just a block east of Broadway, and I couldn't believe it...a taqueria just like back home.Looking at their menu, it's just like a Tacos Mexico or a King Taco. &#160;Tacos &amp; burritos made with the types of meat you come to expect: asada, al pastor, pollo, carnitas, lengua, etc etc. &#160;They also serve albondigas (pork meatballs) as well as elotes (corn on the cob with red chile powder and cotijo cheese). &#160;Best of all, IT ACTUALLY TASTED LIKE MEXICAN FOOD! &#160;Not this "Gringo-Mex" you find at the chains. &#160;And yes, they have huge ice trays with Jarritos in them just like at a normal taqueria. &#160;It really felt like I was eating on Pico &amp; Union.Former Angelenos now living in Seattle, there IS hope! I have a love for TORTAS! Mmm, the bread was soft yet so tasty. I had the adobada meat and it was sooo goood. Seriously. I've tried like 2 or 3 Mexican places for Torta's, and they do not compare to this one!My friend had a carne asada taco and a pollo taco. They were okay, I liked the pollo one better than the carne asada. It had more flavor.The only thing I did not like about this place was the salsas. Unfortunately, it was so gross .None of them had really any flavor (and trust me, I know what good salsa tastes like, having been to Mexico and having really close Mexican friends, and being taught how to make it)!!! It was so bland ,and creamy, and not really any salt or flavor. I didn't eat any of the 4 they had. Otherwise, I loveeee this place and so glad I came here. They do take card, so that's a plus! Yummy! A friend of mine was visiting from out of town and after our late night escapades we decided to come here. His girlfriend had been here before when visiting Seattle and said it was the bomb.We walked there and it's a good thing I had a little buzz because by the time we got there my feet were sore and my stomach growling. &#160;It looks like it was once a McDonald's or something that they didn't remodel, but just took over as a Mexican restaurant. The atmosphere downgraded my rating a star because it is super bright, white and not comfortable. Once you stand in line for your food all you want to do is eat and get out. It was terribly busy, too, for 1:30 am. But it was awesome that it was open that late and so damn cheap.The food was amazing for the price. From the looks of the place from the outside, I would never have guessed the food would be this tasty. Keep in mind, however, I was VERY hungry and I was slightly under the influence. &#160;I would like to try this place again during more normal hours. I would recommend, though, overall. GREAT tamales, good tacos, lots of tasty salsa on tap. This authentic Mexican place next to Cal-Anderson Park is always busy, and for good reason: cheap eats that taste like the stuff you get in Mexico. &#160;Best for casual dining, don't go here for a romantic date. It's a food truck in an old KFC basically. Prices are cheap and the food is pretty good. A friend had the mole chicken and that looked really really good. Being from California, I am used to an abundance of options for cheap but delicious Mexican food. I did not consider this when I decided to go to college in Seattle. The First two years were difficult from the stand point that the northwest's idea of dishes like enchiladas was tortillas drenched in tomato sauce with absolutely no seasoning. Definitely not idealBut then my junior rolled around and this wonderful place opened. I was skeptical at first about whether it could live up to California standards. Nonetheless I tried Rancho Bravo and was turned into a believer. They had every dish and meat style you could possibly want (and some you may not want). Honestly this may seem like a dirty hole in the wall type place but if you are craving Mexican food, look no further! This is the spot for good authentic and FAST and cheap Mexican food! Pretty much everything on the menu is under $5 and delicious! I've had the carnitas tacos and chicken mole burrito (on seperate occasions) and both were very tasty and fresh! Chains like taco del mar or chipotle can't touch rancho bravo.. it's not even fair! All the ingredients are made fresh and the service is very fast! This location is especially popular on weekend nights &#160;- open late for those nights on Capital Hill. It's as authentic as it gets in the States. The tacos &#160;served here taste and are served &#160;just like the ones I've had in Mexico (radish slices included.) Everyone should try Rancho Bravo (even just once) to see for themselves :) Rancho Bravo is the one of the best Mexican places I ever been to and definitely one of the best in Seattle. &#160;To confess I haven't eaten at a ton of Mexican places and where I'm from in Baltimore, most of the fair is OK I would dare to say lacking compared to the Mighty West Coast Mexican Eateries. &#160;Rancho Bravo gives you the atmosphere of a taco truck since it's in an old KFC but the convenience of an indoor place. &#160;I usually get the Mole Chicken Bravo Burritto(4.95) and it's freakin' awesome! So sloppy too. &#160;I also get a Doradito(1.25) and the amount of Cilantro on it is very refreshing to the palate. &#160;Of course they have Mexican Coke but I usually go fountain since its only a buck and I can drink massive amounts of Coke. &#160;It's also a great place because it's a confluence of neighborhood young folks, &#160;families and loners and I like that. &#160;Definitely go and see for yourself and eat in the park and people watch, &#160;you won't regret it. Fantastic for what it is: &#160;cheap, tasty, and satisfying Mexican food and that's what the stars are for. &#160;If you're looking for ambiance or a transcendent dining experience, look elsewhere and spend more money.If you want to improve the atmosphere, get your food to go, walk across the street and eat while watching dodge ball, bike polo, soccer, or whatever happens to be going on at Cal Anderson Park. &#160;You can also walk less than a block to get some Molly Moon's for dessert.I've lived in LA and Chicago (largest port of entry of legal immigration from Mexico) and Rancho Bravo is almost as good as what I got in those cities.The burritos are compact but dense and packed with meat instead of lots of starchy fillers. &#160;The Bravo burrito was a bit dry for my taste, so I prefer the Rancho burrito which includes sour cream. &#160;The pozole (pork stew) and meatballs (also in a soup/stew form) are also quite good, and it's nice to be able to get horchata - although I have had better horchata. Uh...thank the LORD.I've been searching high and low for real tacos for the past five months (I'm an LA girl). This was it. Truly, authentically, really, it. I almost felt like I was in a taqueria stop somewhere in downtown LA if I closed my eyes and ignored the cold breeze. Almost...There is hope in the world!!!!! Man. I've passed by this place a many a time during my visits to Capitol Hill and always wondered what was inside... Well one night I discovered that 1. It's a taco place. 2. It's cheap and 3. Its tacos are pretty satisfying after a drink or two.I'm going to have to come back during the day time to give it a completely accurate look as my memories of this particular food endeavor are a bit hazy... Horchata? Yes, please! More places should offer a refreshing glass of horchata to go with their tacos.Overall a very decent meal. As others have noted, it's super cheap. My main problem was the inconsistency in quality. Yes, I realize it is cheap food, but the quality still ranged from great to poor.I got three tacos - spicy pork, steak, and fish. The spicy pork was really superb. I wish I had just gotten 3 of that, actually. The steak was decent and the fish I didn't even finish. They just loaded the fish taco with cabbage and onions - way too much. When I forked some off, I realized the quality of the fish just wasn't that great either. Live and learn - I would definitely come back, I would just concentrate on the good stuff next time.Wifey got a burrito. She believes Chipotle is better. This place even beats some of the mexican restaurants I've been to. Good food that's cheap.. can't beat that. Rancho Bravo is like a taco truck only much bigger and with no wheels!The food here is pretty good with all the basic items you might expect like tacos (of course), burritos, and nachos but you will also find some really good authentic dishes like posole and albondigas. I tried a few of the tacos and a new item on the menu referred to as Mexican style corn on the cob. It's the classic corn on the cob with mayo, chile powder, and cotija cheese and was very delicious.The building has seen better days and the owners haven't really done much to improve it, but like I was saying earlier this is a taco truck on steroids so you shouldn't be looking for anything too fancy. The service was very fast and everyone had a smile although there was a fair amount of chatting by the cashiers with friends that had stopped in for a visit.This isn't a place I would have at the top of my list of go to restaurants on the Hill, but is definitely a solid option for good food at reasonable prices. Simple, tasty, lightening-fast. Service is friendly. Waits in line during the lunch rush should be expected (could be up to 20mins). Why? Because out of all the Mexican options on this part of the hill, Ranch Bravo rules the roost when it comes to price and quality. The secret is out. I was very suspicious when my favorite taco truck in Seattle decided to go legit and open up an actually restaurant. &#160;I'm happy to report that they've managed to successfully transplant the cheap-n-tasty ambiance of their 45th Ave truck, and add some new, tasty grub to the menu as well.I've always been a fan of Rancho Bravo's mole sauce--I almost always order a rice'n'bean bowl with mole--but I've recently become addicted to their tacos dorados. &#160;I never thought I'd go back to hard-shell tacos, but Rancho Bravo has brought me back. Thank god - we've finally found good tacos in Seattle!!!!! I was really drunk the first time I ate here and thought it was the best thing ever. &#160;I decided to hold off on writing my review until I got the chance to try it sober. &#160;Having been here a couple more times at varying degrees of sobriety, I can say it's a solid 4-star Mexican fast food joint that gets elevated to 5 stars while under the influence. &#160;But more importantly, it's a nice post-bar alternative to the numerous hot dog stands littered around that area. &#160;If you're going to eat here late, make sure to get there by 1:30am or be prepared to wait in line for quite a while. This place is just nom-ful! I like coming here post a shopping binge at the Hill's VV. I LOVE the hot sauce because places don't usually really pack it with this kind of heat. The grub is comparable to all those yummy little Mexican places scattered all over Austin, TX. I'm going to be honest, sometimes I make excuses to come here. It is a place I go out of my way to eat at. I'm glad they opted to start accepting CC for payment a few years ago. It was frustrating not getting my tacos because I didn't have cash sometimes. Hmmm, actually now that I'm writing about it I think a "shopping" trip is in order..... The meat is typically very dry at Rancho Bravo, but the pazole is yummy. Pretty good Mexican food. And decent prices. I stumbled upon Rancho Bravo pretty late on a Friday night when Dick's decided to close a bit early (meaning, 1:45 a.m.). I do not believe I've been back to Dick's late at night since. Rancho Bravo blows it out of the water; the food is pretty cheap, pretty good, pretty customizable, and pretty flavorful compared to a standard hamburger. I've brought a bunch of friends here in the months since, and I've yet to have one who did not rave about Rancho Bravo afterwards. The bowls are pretty good, but then again, almost everything there is. Highly recommended. Cheap tasty food. Good drunken stop on the way home (or mid-bar hopping). Service is fast. Horchata is delicious. Authentic-enough for me. I love that they didn't change the building from before when it was a KFC... just left it all fast-food feeling... I always feel dirty going in there - like I'm eating at McDonalds without having to eat at McDonalds. It's not quite fast food, but it's very close to it! I give this restaurant five stars for very the cheap, good Mexican food. The nachos are especially good! Although I won't eat there. I prefer to take the food to go, or eat at Cal Anderson across the street. The seating area isn't the most comfortable, or cleanest. The kitchen however is visible, and appears to be clean. I'll go back for more good and quick food soon! The best Mexican fast food I've found in Seattle. Quality ingredients, friendly service, clean facility, and the food just tastes fantastic! I highly recommend this place for a quick bite! I was working graveyard at VMMC w/ a few friends one night. We were starving and one of my friend &#160;recommended R.B. I tried the tacos and torqitas (probably misspelled) and i was HOOKED! Their green and red spicy sauce topped off the tacos and torqitas perfectly. Only 4 stars because i wished there was more location by my place..*Tukwila* Tacos were ok. The meat was overcooked.... But it was still better than a taco bell. The tacos were authentic, not Americanized. The restraurant overall was very dirty. Bathrooms were also dirty and graffiti were painted on the walls. I wouldn't go back because not located on the best side of town. Cheap and Tasty. &#160;Get the TORTA.And wash it down with a HORCHATA (cinnamon rice milk).I really want to try the Mexican Hot Chocolate, but they're always out.If you're here late tho on a weekend, be prepared to spend quality time with the Capitol Hill clubbers and all your favorite HS students. Definitely fills a desparately vacant late-night food niche in the pike/pine corridor. &#160;My opinion of the place is skewed in that I only eat here after going to the bars; that said I've never been disappointed by &#160;the quesadillas and tacos. &#160;Prices are really cheap. &#160;Also, they have good tortas and roasted red pepper tamales. 3.5 stars. The location's great for grabbing a perfect portion of Mexican food to enjoy in Cal Anderson and the service here is fast and polite (I'd say they were friendly but the line and the food moves so quickly that there's hardly time to chitchat and be friendly). The prices are just right and the food is a little better than OK. If you're just looking for a small snack, the tacos are a great choice but if you're actually hungry, just go straight for the delicious burritos, and be sure to order them wet (~$5 for a burrito, whereas tacos are ~$2). Skip the nachos, though; when I ordered my nachos with shredded pork, I got chips with all the toppings, covered in a couple hunks of melted cheese (that were very hard to eat once they cooled) and a couple slabs of pork. If at all possible, skip the dingy KFC interior and eat at one of their nice outdoor tables (recently added!) or in the park. Came here on a late night (perfect for satisfying the munchies!). &#160;The food is cheap, tasty, and plentiful. &#160;Warning: the pozole packs a bit spice, so it is best accompanied with a large cup of horchata!The super ghetto interior cracks me up. This place is great. &#160;I had a veggie burrito here tonight, with eggplant, zucchini, etc. &#160;It was fantastic. &#160;The salsas they have are so fresh and unique. &#160;I'd recommend this to anyone looking for authentic, unpretentious Mexican food. I think if I were to have a craving for Mexican - this is definitely the place I would go to eat. &#160;1. Cheap.2. Fast3. Great outdoor seating4. So many choices in sauces to choose from5. Very good location (walking distance from me).And... I really like their chicken quesadilla with fresh salsa and sour cream! I don't like fast food so I just went in with a friend and got an horchata, which was very satisfying. I did try a bite of the enchilada style bravo burrito with jalape&#241;os, but thought it was blah. Only five bucks tho so I guess that ain't bad? I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place. This will be short and sweet.EAT HERE. TACOS = YUM. BURRITOS = YUM. SALSA IN DIFFERENT SPICE LEVELS = YUM.Layout is a little weird though so you stand awkwardly while waiting for your food or grabbing sauces but so worth it. Like Nike says, "Just do it!" "This shit right here, this shit right here..." (Kat Williams voice)This place is the shit, no toliet. &#160;I love love love their tamales!!!!!! &#160;I've tried everything on their menu and have yet to be disappointed! &#160;I think it's hella funny how they have their taco truck parked in front of the resturant though...hahah! &#160;Reminder of their come up from the bus to the building lolFavorites: Tamales, rice bowls, tacos, horchata(hit or miss)PLEASE DO HURRY UP &amp; EAT HERE IF YOU HAVEN'T YET ALREADY! favorite drunken/late night at the office/too lazy to cook fast food place to eat on the hill. cheap, fast and filling. nachos are my go-to but, the lengua burrito = burrito heaven. also, it's in the perfect spot! right across from cal anderson. great for people watching.. never a dull moment ;o) Rancho Bravo's pozole soup is one of the best things I've ever eaten. Delicious! i never used to crave for mexican food... thanks, rancho bravo!
Fabulous music venue! &#160;We had great seats, nice and comfy and right up front. &#160;Great view of the stage, although it looked like you could get a great view almost every where you sat. &#160;Very impressed with my first time at the Triple Door (for a show, &#160;I have been to their lounge before just for drinks and socializing). &#160;The bathroom is all the ways downstairs, which is not a fun trip especially in heels.I came with a group of 4 and we all really liked it. &#160;The show was spectacular. We saw "This is Halloween" which was kind of a burlesque cabaret Halloween show. &#160;Good music, and costumes, and characters! &#160;Really liked the lighting for the show.Drinks were good and food was yummy. &#160;Mainly asian fusion/thai which I love! &#160;Only thing is the portions are miniature and it's a bit pricey.But definitely well worth it, we all had an incredible night! I was meaning to write a review for the EE that we had here a while back.Food was excellent as they were passing out satay chicken, calamari, veg spring rolls and pork skewers. &#160;Wine was excellent and my buddies loaded up on the beer. Yelp crowd was fun as usual. Everyone grabbing the FREE swag and triple door gave out FREE tickets for two.I used my tickets for Shelby Lyne and it was a Fabulous show.Very limited seating made you feel like a VIP. You order your food and drinks and watch the concert. Food is pricey but you splurge once in a while. A great venue for those live shows you want to see up close and center. Great venue for a show. All really good seats. &#160;Been here many times but recently saw Storm Large here. AMAZING!! We all had great seats (comfortable and roomie) and a good time. Service is a little lacking. Maybe they should staff a little better? The Triple Door is one of those places that the people of Seattle are always going to. &#160;All kinds of events happen there from formal 'have tickets purchased early' shows to smaller performances in the bar. &#160;The Triple Door has a number of house drinks, a solid happy hour menu, and they serve a variety of mildly swanky appetizers, like the scallops and duck sandwiches both of which I always seem to find myself eating.The downsides are easy to identify, often my table is a little sticky and in need of a good wipe down, this makes me suspect the dark mood lighting may be hiding a few other things that could use a good wipe down. &#160;The prices are not particularly low and there is often limited seating in the bar, as everyone and their brother is always at the Triple Door. &#160;But even so, I kind of love it there.Additionally, I have attended a number of business events there and as an event space things always go smoothly. &#160;It is at one of these company sponsored events that I recommend trying out all the tasty bites and a specialty beverage or two. &#160;Because those Triple Door barkeeps always seem to be brewing up something one of a kind.Speaking of which here is my pro-tip: if you are attending a special concert or presentation consider waiting on drinks until you are seated in the auditorium. &#160;The reason is simple; there are often thematic drinks available within the space that might not be offered at the bar.So go to The Triple Door and have a good time with your friends, really that is what this Seattle standard is there for. Went to The Triple Door last night to see Priscilla Ahn with a group of friends. &#160;We had a great time, despite our... interesting... experience with our waiter and the sub-par cuisine.So before you dispatch the bombs on my apartment, let me explain. &#160;When I say "sub-par" regarding the food, I mean that I expected much better. &#160;For the price, and from the reviews - I was really looking forward to something delicious. &#160;What I got was the same thing I get at Tim Tup Thai down the street - but for triple the cost. &#160;It was decent... definitely edible and flavored well. &#160;But nowhere near the quality I expected.So let's get to the service. &#160;When we sat down, one glass of wine and two beers were ordered from our server. &#160;After about 15 minutes, he walked by, glanced at our table. &#160;I could see in his eyes that he had just remembered our order - and he looked at me and said, "Your drinks are being prepared". &#160;15 more minutes, we finally had them. &#160;I am NOT exaggerating. &#160;I timed him.Our second round was ordered in the same fashion (we order, time passes, I see him remember, he tells us the same BS line about the drinks being made, more time passes..) but this time, I wasn't going to wait around. &#160;I got up (after a total of 25 minutes waiting) and went to the front desk. &#160;I asked that we receive our drinks right away and let them know that our server most definitely appeared to be stoned.So we did receive that round shortly thereafter. &#160;But then, our last two party members joined us. &#160;One of them ordered a bottle of wine, the other a beer. &#160;I let them know ahead of time the deal with the forgetful server - but they seemed optimistic. &#160;The beer came in due time (about 10 minutes)... but the wine was a different story. &#160;After 20 minutes I asked my friend if he wanted me to get up and complain again and he asked that I didn't. &#160;I stayed seated. &#160;At the 30 minute mark, the manager showed up to pour his wine.I let her know how long our wait had been and she apologized profusely. &#160;From then on, our service was immaculate! &#160;She came by personally at least 5 more times to fill our water glasses, check on the food, take our drink orders and clean the table. &#160;When the bill came, she comp'd the wine we waited for as well as the round of drinks that had been so late and our last round of drinks. The manager (I wish I knew her name!) is a fantastic example of exactly what I look for in a professional in the service industry. &#160;She takes pride in what she does, makes sure that her customers are happy and compensates when an ill experience is had. &#160;If not for her, this would be a two-star review.On a final note: Priscilla Ahn was amazing! There are no bad seats here! Only complaint is that service was impossible to get mid-show - having to watch for a waiter while trying to watch a show because they don't come and ask if you need anything is less than ideal. More than likely we'll go back because its a) under Wild Ginger and b) got a diverse selection of great music. &#160;But the food is quite mediocre, despite the chef being the same as Wild Ginger. &#160;I think downstairs they rush the food since its really about drinks and music down there (drinks are decent in the bar). &#160;But its the theater in back that I have to complain about. &#160;The staff seems eternally overwhelmed, so much so that we just assumed that they were new and even told them "we understood." &#160;They then told us that they were not new and had been working there for some time. &#160;Oops. &#160;There goes my sympathy. &#160;One of them was so bad that I just looked her in the eye and said, "you'd rather not be doing this huh..." and she, honestly, said "no, not at all." &#160;Problem is, she was one of the better ones! &#160;But the music was/is great there, good sound too...the food isn't worth the price at all, so stick to the cheap appetizers and well drinks. 3.5* for Musiquarium: Regular spot for me, the drinks are reliable (if Brian is serving), the food predictable and the genre hopping weekday music nights are satisfying. The happy hour food frequently comes out sans moisture by a heat lamp from the bowels of Thai Ginger kitchen, but the busier it is the fresher the dish. weird.I will continue to come to the lounge for the local artists &amp; funky people watching - this rarely fails to make a workday's stresses melt away.3* for Triple Door: For some reason, we tend to get the angry or snarky server in the booth. On top of said meanypants behavior - Orders were incorrect, meat presented at the wrong level of charred, and drinks took for-freakin-ever. Not just once, THRICE. I did have the best Spanish coffee concoction of my life here, though.As far as performance perspective, not super impressed with the venue. Can be cozy and acoustically sufficient, depending on the players. The intimacy is a bonus if you are up front &amp; center. I have been to the Triple Door many times and the shows are always great! The service can be slow at times but I have worked as a server and I know the reasons for delays can be more complicated than they appear and are not always the server's fault. Anyway, on that note, I want to commend our server from the last visit. I believe his name was James (he had long hair pulled back). He was very professional and checked in on us often and made sure we got exactly what we wanted. The old man next to me even leaned over and said "that's the nicest server I've ever had." We left a big tip but just in case the management reads these reviews, please thank him again for making our evening so enjoyable! &#160;It was the best service I've ever had at the Triple Door! I've been to two concerts there, and I think it's the best music venue in town. &#160;The first time, I attended alone and was seated at the stage. &#160;It was an acoustic concert, and the view was unbeatable. &#160;It was dark, however, and it was a little difficult to see what I was eating. &#160;The second time, I was seated with a group at a table up front--another great view, and with the candle on the table, I could actually see what I was eating. &#160;Love the fragrant duck from the Wild Ginger! Our board selected this venue for an event and it went off seamlessly. &#160;The entire staff was pleased with the arrangements. Great music, excellent food from the kitchen upstairs (or is it next door?). Great management, good location. Love seeing shows here! love the drinks in the bar, love the seating in the venue, love the drinks in the venue. &#160;i understand they also serve food as well as drinks.(I can be VERY picky about drinks and these were well made and worth the price) Great for a show! A formal setting. No space to get up and move your body..... The food is just blahhhhhThe rating is only for concerts and shows.... &#160;not for drinks and food...:) I've been here several different times now and overall I have to say this is a spectacular venue for shows and live music. I think the musicquarium is highly under-rated! There are some awesome bands that play and you can just walk in, order a beer or cocktail, and sit and listen! Happiness.My only problem with the musicquarium is that it's hard to talk over the music sometimes... but the up side to that is the music experience is immersive and wonderful! Love it! The staged shows I've seen here have all &#160;been AWESOME!! $25 for a burlesque version of Nightmare Before Christmas??? OK!!! And they'll serve me food and drinks DURING the show with little to no disruption??? YES! All the seats I've been in have been great views of the stage. I've never been disappointed.I wish the box office would fix their mics- It's really patchy and hard to hear the box office employee.It's a fancy venue- really great for a date or small group of friends- but I didnt feel weird in casual dress. People do tend to dress up here for shows though.GREAT service. Unpretentious and very warm and helpful. Birthday parties, charity benefits, concerts and performances... Triple Door is a quadruple threat. I loooove this venue. I had front-row seats for fly moon royalty/allen stone though, so how could you not love that? as for the food, I'm always hearing rants- wild ginger this, wild ginger that... so, relative to my expectation, the pricing wasn't too unreasonable. HOWEVER there's an inverse relationship between the rise of tuition and the weight of my wallet, so I opted to split the pad thai with a friend. it actually ended up being more than enough for both of us, and it was pretty tasty! if you go here to see someone as kickass as allen stone, I'd definitely recommend trying to get tickets for the "community tables" up front; there's something special about being close enough to be perspired on by your favorite singer. one notable observation- there's not a whole lot of room to get your boogie on.. it's more of a stay-seated kind of place. buuuut nonetheless, I'm a big fan of the triple door. Stopped in recently to catch "Land of the Sweets", a burlesque version of the Nutcracker put together by Lily Verlaine (AWESOME). We caught happy hour in the lounge, which was a really sweet deal. Cheap wells, very cheap appetizers. We're talking 3 giant potstickers the size of my fists (Well...I have tiny hands, but, whatever) for $5. Delicious. And the waiter was very attentive and helped us get all our orders in before happy hour was done.The seating area for the actual venue was very cozy and intimate, complete with candlelit tables. Again, the waiter was amazing. Three of us shared some amazing desert which involved a warm brownie and EGGNOG ICECREAM and peppermint candies. Delicious.I docked a star because I still don't know what the hell a Musicquarium is. According to the Triple Door website, it involves a "stunning 1,900 gallon freshwater aquarium." What I saw was an aquarium similar to what you might see in a Chinese or Thai restaurant, except not nearly as cool. There MIGHT have been two TINY fish in there (waaaaay tinier than my tiny fists). It was pretty sad.Overall, though, I highly recommend. Especially if you can get there for happy hour. Awesome place to see a performance, just get there early if you plan on eating so you can see your food! I went here for a friend's birthday party. &#160;I had never been and was pretty excited. &#160;The venue is pretty cool although a lot of the decor when you ar heading down looks like it is held together with bubble gum and scotch tape. &#160;The music for the night was fantastic. &#160;Unfortunately, the food was horrible and the drinks were extremely watered down. &#160;If I were to do it again, I would go just for the show and drink beers during. &#160;A total let down. &#160;Thank goodness the acts were as good as they were. &#160;Won't be giving this one another shot for a very long time. &#160;The potential to be good exists, but just wasn't realized in my visit. Went here for a fundraising event and triple door made special cocktails for the band. The staff was very friendly and the bathrooms were clean. I will definitely come back. so much fun! we watched This is Halloween at the main stage. it's a trendy and open venue with not a single bad seat in the house! even with the servers constantly walking around, we were able to enjoy the show just fine. the show was okay (but the performers worked it!) and the food was alright (from wild ginger). our buddha rolls were so-so, although the pineapple sauce made the dish, and the veggie pad thai was just okay. the noodles were skinnier than usual.. i loved the atmosphere, the people, and the energy. it was great! i'd love to come back to watch another show. One of the best places in town! I love, love, love the triple door. Music: 5Setting: 5People: 4Drinks/Prices: 3A great venue for shows (I attended some Burlesque thing here), a great place for live Jazz (free every weekend and high quality performers) and a great place for drinks (really tasty).This is a probably a great place to eat too... getting their food from Wild Ginger, next door. The venue is super intimate and classy. I highly recommend visiting. Awesome Venue... good food... reasonable pricing... helpful staff..... Great place to see a show Well, the Front Desk Hostess was very nice, asking if we had ever been and telling us a little about what to expect. &#160;I was hoping for an awesome seat as I had reserved a private booth..... but it wasn't that comfortable, strangely enough. &#160;The seats are kind of shallow, (no I'm not fat:)). &#160;We couldn't see that well over the tall guy at the "bar top" in front of us.......Food: will we had high expectations from Wild Ginger.......but it's obvious that it's all pre-prepared, bummer. &#160;Nothing was that hot temperature wise, as I expected......OK, the Panko Prawns are the best thing on the Menu, they were made to order, for sure. &#160;The Green Curry Chicken and the Duck "Sliders" were just average, &#160;and the Green Beans.....also pre-cooked, not hot and crispy like I was expecting. I guess they can't manage it any other way, but the prices certainly don't reflect the lower staffing costs due to all the pre-cooking. The service was spotty. &#160;Our first waiter disappeared, and the busser said that they sometimes send staff home if it's not that busy......always a mistake in my book, as an $8.00 an hour waiter can make a huge difference in Service, and the savings just ain't that much for the house. &#160;Our next server just wasn't around enough for our liking, oh the food came almost immediately after ordering but there wasn't the personal touch on service. Everyone brings food and you never really connect with your one server.Overall, I though the food would be better, the show was great! Great venue! I didn't get to try the food but it smelled delicous! The band was great (Paperboys). I'll definitely come back for a date night! been here a couple times for dinner and a show, and i have to admit that it's pretty awesome. with other options for dinner theater around the city, i have to say that this is my favorite. we have been here for "Land of the Sweets" for the past couple years and we always have an awesome time. we sit at the same table, and eat delicious asian-fusion food while we are entertained by talented performers. it is an awesome date night and a fabulous experience. it's comfortable. there isn't a bad seat in the house. the food is delicious and served in a timely manner--and you can eat while watching theater! what could be better? I came here last year for the burlesque Nutcracker which was amazing! I don't think there's a bad seat anywhere! I'm putting together my list of friends to attend again this year and we're making it an annual tradition. I recommend coming here for ANY show. They have such a great venue and their food is pretty good too! I saw an awesomely fun burlesque show here a few weeks ago and really enjoyed myself.The theater they have for stage performances is really beautiful inside and it's intimate but also large enough so you don't feel like you're sitting on top of everyone. I was a little disappointed by the cocktail menu and the drink I had was just okay.If there's a show you want to see at the theater, I'd definitely recommend going but I'd recommend eating somewhere else prior to and only having a drink or two because they really aren't worth the high price. Definitely try the scallops. &#160;The music is chill. &#160;Just make sure you take a flashlight or something because it's difficult to read the menu with just a tiny candle at the table. Items tried:- fragrant duck sliders- Seafood Thai Noodles- Vietnamese spring rolls- Thai chicken satayEverything tasted great. &#160;I highly recommend the duck sliders. &#160;They were absolutely delicious. &#160;This is a very nice place to bring a date, chill, or even just come to eat. &#160;This place can get very loud, so I would recommend bringing some ear plugs. &#160;You will have to park in the garage as there are no parking spots in the vicinity. &#160;Definitely will come back again. I went to see Cutis Salgado last month and had an excellent time! &#160;Great seats, great acoustics, great venue, lighting, ambiance, etc. &#160;And the tickets where only $18! &#160; Our server was new but we only knew that because she told us. &#160;We had lots of drinks and some appetizers. &#160;I'm not sure why everyone acts like the food from the Wild Ginger is all that because it isn't. &#160;We had the shorts ribs, good, the pot stickers, good, the Budha rolls, boring, and the shrimp skewers, horrible.The next time I go, I will skip the appetizers and just go for the show and the drinks. &#160;Hopefully Curtis returns soon! &#160;If you haven't seen him, you're soooo missing out! The triple door is so fancy and the service is so great. I love coming to see a show here. I just saw This is Halloween and could not believe what a great production it was. But its the room that shows are in that is really extraordinary, no other places like it in seattle that come to mind. Reminds me of a Vegas showroom. I love that waiters come around to the tables multiple times during a show. One time I came with a large group and they upgraded us to a private room in advance, what a nice thing to do. The bar upstairs is also great, I love the giant fish tank. Unfortunately though I dont love the food as much as I could. I do enjoy the satay and I appreciate that they have some vegetarian options. I hear the potstickers are great. And I think my boyfriend enjoyed his meat like dishes in times past. He also liked his recent japanese IPA. I would love some more varieties in shows though, often there is nothing that catches my interest, but every once in a while. Plus the triple door was super nice to everyone at the yelp adrenaline adventures, but honestly I loved them before that. We have been at the Triple Door on a few occassions. And even had an "off" night there however instead of yelping it in detail, I decided to contact the Manager and explain what happened. Some Business say they stand behind their services, others really do. We were asked to give it another shot, and we did. And we were convinced that we truly did have an off night because seriously nothing could have been added (other then meeting Jon Anderson in person) that could have made this experience more wonderful. And that is what an evening at the Triple Door is, an experience. So here is the breakdown:Venue: Not a bad seat in the house unless you have obnoxious neighbors...but the music,drinks etc make up for thoseDrinks: Impressive wine and even beer selection, but the mixed drinks are fantastic. I was very pleasantly surprisedAccoustic: Always on the money!Food: 95% spot on. Out of 5+ visits, one not so great experience. I will chuck it off to chef having an off night, we all have thoseService: the servers realize that this is usually an evening out and that they are there to make your night even better..as with any establishment you have good servers and great servers...most of them are fantasticManagement: ABOVE AND BEYOND! just the way it should be.Out of all of Seattle's venues this is by far my favorite. Sorry Jazz Alley..now get some more of my favorite artists in so I have a reason to go :-)My only major complaint is not with the TD or their staff but with the patronage who at times think they are at an outdoor hoedown..this is a gorgeous venue...try to blend in, dress up a little. a ripped t shirt and holy shorts are not the way to go. Just saying Delicious Asian food, chopsticks and live entertainment, in a dimly lit theater, is a great combination for an exciting evening on the town. &#160;if you're hosting a crowd, reserve one of the green rooms. &#160;They have offer similar menu items as their sister restaurant upstairs (Wild Ginger). &#160;Be prepared though for the low light during the show. &#160;It can be a challenge to eat your food. We had a great time seeing Hurt last night! Neither of us had been to the triple door before, but we were blown away! Great vibe! Reminds me of the vintage entertainment lounges where you are in an intimate setting, sitting comfortably at tables/booths, with amazing food and drinks! We will definetly be going back!! My only complaint is that there was a photographer all over the stage, getting up in their business and being super distracting. I also just felt that that was really disrespectful to the band as well as to those who paid to see them. My friend &amp; I stopped here to listen to a band while we had dinner. The band was good, ambiance was good, food was ok.Thai chicken satay - really good and flavorfulGreen papaya salad - very fresh and different than a normal saladPanang beef curry - very bland, needed much more flavorThis is a good place if you wanna be entertained while you're eating. 3 stars for food that was inconsistent and unremarkable. 4 stars for concert environment and service. &#160;2 of four dishes I had were good.I saw Jon Anderson here and the acoustics and atmosphere were great. Prices are too high for food. Came here for music and dinner on a quiet, snowy Sunday night-We had large plate of Mandarin chicken and Pad Thai- OMG, the food was surprisingly good and generous portion- we could have just ordered one of them-Music was decent- very nice staff!!! Went there last night to see Crooked Still, the concert, stage and seats were all awesome, no complains there. The staff was very nice, I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about.I would love to go back to see another show but next time we will try to get te cheaper seats that don't come with the &#160;$40 paid in advance credit for food and drinks. The bad reviews about the food are all true, I was highly disappointed, it tasted like any food you can get for half the price at a neighborhood chinese restaurant. I had the Angkor (sp?) Wat chicken and even though it had a nice flavor it had more onions and peppers than chicken, my husband had the 7 spice steak, I tried it an was unimpressed. The peasant chicken satays were good but then again 2 for $6.50 is a little expensive and the peanut sauce was cold as well as the rice squares. We finised our meal with the cheese platter...what a joke! $15 will buy you 2 tiny squares of some white cheeses, a smear of stinky cheese, 3 slices of hard tiny bread, some slices of waffer like crackers, a handful of tasty cinnamon pecans and a tiny cup of dates and raisins. Now we know, skip the booth seats, eat somewhere else and just get a beer or two at the Triple Door. All the seats are good in this place, I gave it 3 stars only because I felt ripped off by the food especially in today's economy businesses shouldn't get away with things like this.
Laptop camper here. Camp and eat banh mi at this new spot close to the University of Washington. The traditional banh mi sandwiches are $4. They also have specialty banh mi sandwiches ($5) like beef stew, lemongrass fish and five spice duck, plus drinks, smoothies, homemade Vietnamese yogurt, spring rolls ($1.50 a roll) and Asian popsicles. They make their own sauces and spreads.* Grilled pork banh mi ($4): Liked their baguette - it was small, thin, and light, soft on the inside and lightly crunchy on the outside. The veggies were fresh (cucumber, pickled carrot and daikon, onion, jalapeno, cilantro) but the veggies needed to be pickled longer (not tangy enough). The small bits of marinated grilled pork were tasty but I'd prefer larger pieces. The homemade garlic aioli didn't have a strong garlic flavor. They didn't add too much soy. The sandwich was smaller than usual.Laptop campers, I didn't see any power outlets and the seats aren't comfortable. The wi-fi is free and secure.You know you love me. X0 X0, laptop camper. Delicious. I've personally never seen sandwiches so full of ingredients. There are plenty of places I've gone where the meat and vegetables are served in meager amounts. I ordered a few of the pork banh mi. Took a few minutes to make each one, but I appreciated the thought and carefulness (watched them make them with diligence). The sandwich is so flavorful. Meat is chewy, tasty, and the pickled radish and onions just back it up! And you get a hefty loaf for $4 (I know a place that sells sandwiches for $3, but half the size compared to what they serve here). It's $5 for special sandwiches. They also serve tea, too. I don't think this place will disappoint. And if you have the Pirq app, they have 20-50% off menu prices, depending on the hour. Give this place a try, totally worth the money and walk from UW. I've always lived in North Seattle but I grew up in the south end when the BEST Vietnamese sandwiches in are made. Well, until now, that is.Tony's bakery is the OG of Bahn Mi deli's, and from what I understand is that the same family owns Bahn Mi Unwrapped (I was nearly in tears when I heard this). &#160;It's like they heard my prayers one day and set up shop in perhaps the hungriest, most Asian part of North Seattle- the Ave. Prices are just a little more expensive than Tony's but a $4 very meaty and very well seasoned sandwich is better than a sloppy "$5 foot long" any day.When I went in I saw their special of the day- a "Pho Dip." Their version of a French Dip. Brilliant.Definitely check this place out. &#160;I'm pretty sure that with the number of times I think about Bahn Mi in a day, I'll be running into you soon enough. i don't know how i blew it, but when i went to Vietnam in 2008, i didn't even know about Banh Mi! I had a great time. beautiful, lovely people, incredibly interesting culture - and yeah, i had some great meals, &#160;but also ended up a few meals that were definitely lacking. Turns out i should have been asking for Banh Mi. i found out 2 years too late.these guys do the Vietnamese Sandwich right. every ingredient is perfectly proportioned and delicious. i usually order 2 and save one for later.also: highly recommend the fish sandwich (though i usually get pork), and the fresh rolls are a great deal at $1.50. only thing that i'd skip? the milkshakes. advertised as 'fresh fruit', it tastes anything but (the strawberry one anyway) After getting the pirq app, had to come here. Ended up with three banh mis for $8.25!! I love good food. But, Unlike hookers, cheap, when it comes to food &#160;is just sexy!We came at about 11:50, and surprisingly, we were the only ones there. The place is clean with decent amount of seating.In general, the bread is freshly made and it pays off. It's soft, yet has a nice crust. Their veggie toppings are generous and pickled well.Now on to the particulars:Pork: &#160;I liked it, but I wanted more meat. &#160;And I'm usually the one pulling some meat out of my sandwiches. &#160;Although the meat was a bit overcooked, the meat to bread ratio just wasn't on par. Duck: This was a little gamey for me. &#160;To be fair, I mostly like duck when it's smoked because of that. &#160;My friend on the other hand, loved it.The Pho Dip: &#160;This joint right here was the bidness! &#160;It's pretty brilliant. &#160;I like to taste everything first plain, just to get the essence of what I'm eating. &#160;So, at first, I thought it was just ok. &#160;I then added sirachi and hoisin (condiments I add to my pho) and then dipped it in the broth, and it tasted a lot like pho in a sandwich. &#160;I really liked this conceptually. &#160;I would give this place 3 stars without the pirq. &#160;Mostly because, I think they're a bit chincy with their meat. &#160;Let's face it banh mis are usually cheap, and pretty generous. &#160;With the pirq, I definitely give it a 4, because at $2.75 a sandwich, I don't expect as much. &#160;Good, cheap, eats. &#160;Not the same as good food, that happens to be cheap.If in the area, and you have the pirq, definitely worthwhile. &#160;Any other time, I headed to the lower Ave for my bahn mi. This place needs more recognition. It's hidden up the ave, and people just don't realize there's a banh mi shop here. It's sad, I want them to get more business so they can stay! I got the tofu spring roll and grilled pork banh mi. The spring roll came with a peanut sauce, and it was delicious. The pork in the banh mi was super flavorful, and came with a garlic aioli that just made the sandwich. Coming back for more, for sure. And all of this for just a little over $6. You will leave here completely full and happy. Today was the second trip into Banh Mi Unwrapped for my sweetie and me (Nook was closed, bummer) and for the first time, I tried the lemongrass fish sandwich. Holy mother of jebus, it was delicious! Plenty of tasty fish and veggies, and a creamy bright green sauce-dunno what's in it but it was delicious! I may have to come back for it once or more a week. If you like good music, or even not-so-good music though, get your sandwich to-go. We were subjected to tween pop on the radio. Pretty sure it was invented by the government to torture political prisoners. My quest for the best bahn mi of the University District has a winner. They have lots of different kinds and every one I've had is great. The fresh bread is key. They are also have fast and friendly service too. I was pleased with both the tofu banh mi and the crispy fish sandwich! &#160;Great chewy yet crusty bread, generous size, good amount of fillings and tasty sauces, including an herbed mayo. &#160;The spring roll wasn't very good--plain and sloppy. &#160;But I might try one again. &#160;One of my favorite banh mi joints. &#160;Oh, and for both visits only 2-3 other customers were seen. I recently went on a mini self guided banh mi tour of the Ave and tasted seven different sandwiches in three days! I tried the three most popular Vietnamese restaurants: Thanh Vi, Saigon Deli, and Banh Mi Unwrapped. The pork sandwich was quite tasty but I got a few little bones and it wasn't quite as good as Thanh Vi. The five spice duck was really good and unique and there were lots of other interesting sandwiches you wont find at any other banh mi shop. Both had right amount of good pickled vegetables and good bread, but this place is just a little more expensive than the others.
amazing eggplant bhartha. delicious and moist without being smothered in grease (as is the case with most other indian places ive tried around here. ew.). this is a good place for reasonably priced, reliable indian food. id go here over mirch masala any day. Add half a star here, as it should read 3 1/2 stars. I recently tried this restaurant (take-out) after reading positive yelp reviews and wasn't disappointed.I ordered Chicken Vindaloo, Vegie Samosas and Garlic Naan. The Chicken Vindaloo, while not the most flavorful ever (lack of spices), was tasty. The Samosas, especially paired with the chutneys, were delicious, and the naan was ok, a little bit too rubbery for me.All in all, I think this place is a good bargain. Might I find 'more bang for my buck?' Maybe-we'll see. India Express is a value, though, with the aforementioned food costing $15. i really enjoyed this restaurant! &#160;i was loyal to chutney's, but the recent times i've been there during my trips to seattle it hasn't been the same... some friends recommended this place... &#160;their tikka masala sauce was made just right.. the right blend of creamy, spicy, and tomato saucy. &#160;i really loved their saag aloo. &#160;the naan was crispy on the outside, and tender and warm in the inside.great selection of eastern asian beers. &#160;they were so kind to fulfill our endless requests, fill our glasses of water, and even gave complimentary dessert to our party of 6 to celebrate the b-day girl's day!
Some of the best chicken tikka masala I've had (Please note - I am not an Indian fare conniouseur by ANY means - so when I say best what I mean is - I've eaten at two different restaraunts and this was the best of the two).I don't think I'll find a better naan though, seriously. &#160;The service can be slow as stated by Jessica but it's a great people watching place especially if you get a window seat! I eat here way too much. &#160;India express is close to my house, speedy (especially for take-out) and provide serviceable Indian cuisine. &#160;They also don't hassle me for delivering to my place, despite the fact I live 2 blocks away, when I'm too lazy to walk there or have lost the capability of walking due to injury (thanks kickball!). &#160;The food here is nothing special, if anything I find it very variable. &#160;The naan bread is often nice and moist, sometimes if I'm lucky there's even small pools of grease (nummy!) but at other times, it's burned through and thin. &#160;The chicken tikka masala used to be top notch, but recently has turned into a bit of a runny mess, but it's still quite tasty! &#160;The people that run this place are always super nice and I like them, I just wish they were more consistent -- although maybe not, that would probably just mean I'd eat here more! &#160;Also a few people have said that they'll make you're food really hot for you. &#160;I've never been particularly burned by them...despite my trying. When I lived in the CD, India Express was on our speed dial. &#160;It was one of the only delivery places (of any persuasion) that would come to our Garfield Neighborhood, so that made it a favorite. &#160;But the food is really really good. &#160;I admit that I hesitate to review this place because I am not a connoisseur of Indian food. &#160;I can't compare it to anything else because for most of my life, I wouldn't touch it. &#160;But, after moving to the CD and having to choose between Pizza Time and India Express when I was too lazy to cook or go out (which was a fair amount of time), I came to love it.Try the Tikka Masala, plain naan, and mango chutney. &#160;I always order my meals "medium spicy" and its pretty spicy. {review of take-out/delivery only}We order India Express regularly. &#160;Since the birth of our first child, we have come to appreciate the restaurants that deliver in Capitol Hill.We are indeed creatures of habit. &#160;We almost always make the same order:- Chicken Tikka Masala - mmm... perfect combination of creamy and spicy- Chicken Jalfreze - onions, hot peppers and chicken. &#160;TANGY.- Saag Paneer - they don't skimp on the Paneer- Aloo Gobi - CardaYUMmy- Naan - can't go wrongFor delivery Indian, I give them FIVE STARS. &#160;The food is IMHO very good. &#160;We bring up ordering India Express like a secret sin - &#160;"Oooooh, should we get India Express tonight?"... :)They are also very, very polite on the phone and also at the door.Minus one star because they can be quite slow and they are a bit pricey. This place saved my ass.I work for an office, and I had to do a quick lunch. I ordered in and, of course, had to bargain as to what time it was going to be ready (I swear, we bargained. It was the weirdest thing. But, they eventually agreed to the time I requested). Delivery is iffy with this place.Fine, I'll do pickup. Anyway, everyone - all 20 of us - was really hungry and I was late for work that day. So, I trundled up the hill to this place, and I got a spot out front. My ginormous order was ready and waiting. The staff was helpful and quintessentially curious: they packaged the food up and labeled it neatly; they carried it out and put it in my car; they rang me up quick so I was in and out. They were very concerned as to whether or not I was having a good day. I was having a decidedly better day. I told them so. I got the food back, and it was a hit. Our Indian "expert" said it beat out Cedars and Taste of India. I agree.Good job, India Express! I've never eaten AT India Express. If I'm going to get dressed and leave the house to get something to eat, especially if it's going to be Indian food, there are a million places better than India Express. Their delivery, though, is hard to beat. When I am too lazy to leave the house but can't bear the thought of ordering pizza, India Express is my go-to restaurant. They're usually fast, I've never had them mess up an order, and their prices are decent. As far as quality goes... Meh. They're ai'ight. They've gotten better since they changed owners. The tikka masala is usually good. The vindaloo not so much. The garlic naan is good, but not great-- sometimes too chewy. And the make-up of the rice isn't very consistant. I'd order from them for delivery any day, but if you're looking to go out to eat, go somewhere else. There's much better food to be had. After two phone calls, a return call from them and a 5 dollar surcharge, they were sufficiently persuaded to send a delivery driver to Belltown. &#160;Add that to my lengthy list of reasons that I hate Belltown but I digress. &#160;The food was tasty and the spiciness seemed to correspond pretty closely to the "5 of 6" I ordered for my chicken tikka masala. &#160;My girlfriend had vegetable saag and she said it was good but she thought the carrots came out of some frozen bag; that's her fault for not being more carnivorous. &#160;I'd order from them again, assuming I can convince them to deliver to my apartment. &#160;I'd put this on the high end of indian delivery food. This is the best place to call when you are depressed, alone, feeling agoraphobic, want to die, don't want to put on clothes to go to store to buy food to put in your mouth but havent eaten in three days etc. The Chicken Tikka Masala ordered very very spicy is good. So is the Malay Kafta, make sure its very very spicy. Unspicy is kind of gross.Their delivery is pretty good, but the last time I called, the dude got mad at me because I lived so close to their location. Ok, so three blocks. I told them that I'd tip well, but then I got nervous that they'd do something to my food, so I put real clothes on and ended up walking to pick up my order. Next time, act like you don't know where their store is when they mention that your address is awfully close to theirs. Or I guess, go and pick it up, but then, whats the point?
One of my favorite cheap dinners in Seattle! Get the lamb and beef jumbo gyro and you will not be disappointed. I wouldn't recommend the whole wheat pita since it's stiffer and doesn't mesh with the rest of the flavors and textures well. Just accept that this won't be a healthy meal and make up for it later. DaDaDaDANK pita yo. Best on da Aaaavvvvee It's all about the late night cravings. As a former New Yorker, I had to give this place a try the moment I saw it. The gyros are decent but not life changing. Are gyros ever life changing? Anyways, they are about as good as the gyro food carts in Manhattan but still a long way from the gryos you get in a top-notch Greek/mediterranean restaurant. My main qualm with Aladdin is that their meat is never hot. I have had a couple gyros where the meat was close to room temperature. Gyros need to be hot and sizzling. Otherwise, they just taste weird. Stopped by here for a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised! What I liked about this place was that they cook everything right there so you know everything that goes into it. I had the lamb and beef gyro and it was pretty good. The vegetables were grilled so the flavors mixed in everywhere. The fries were crispy with a bit of seasoning. I enjoyed the feel of the restaurant and the price of the food. CASH ONLY! &#160;I went here with a girlfriend of mine who once lived near here. &#160;She said she used to come here once a week and grab a cheap and delicious lamb gyro. &#160; It was a curry filled tasty gyro. &#160;I believe she said they were Turkish gyros! &#160;Raven didn't care for the way they were prepared but I liked them. &#160;And so did our friend.Long story short, this is a cheap eat on the ave. &#160; I probably won't return because of Ravens preferences, but I spy a good deal when I see one! I could eat here every day, and I practically do. The lamb gyros and Greek fries are the best around. Service is usually pretty quick, and they're open late. Much faster service than their other location. Cheap Quick.. hella cheap and good.. Did I mention cheap? Great place for a great meal at a steal! I've tried the lamb gyro, the meal with lamb rice and salad. I've also had their greek fries and the Baklava. All very good. The food is always fresh and you don't have to wait long for your order.The guys behind the counter are friendly and the atmosphere is very low key. I come here at least once every two weeks. Best gyro in town, was my favorite during my undergrad years at the UW (04' - 08'). I recently went back to see how it was - to my delight, still the best! Lamb and beef jumbo with fries and drink for only $6.50. God that is a mighty deal. I hope they stay in business for a long time. Fantastic food, fantastic value. This place and Mr. Gyro's put pretty much every other gyro place to shame. Best Mediterranean food in town. &#160;Cash only, but if you have 20 bucks, you have enough for a dinner for two. &#160;All of their dishes are good, from the standard gyro to the combination plates are awesome. &#160;Open late every day too. &#160;Great place. Tasteful and satisfying, this place is by far one of the best places to get gyros yet. Not only that but they offer the best Greek fries on top of their mouth watering baklava. Definitely one of the hit spots for a grab-and-go meal.Dishes ordered: Lamb and beef gyro, greek fries, baklava My first time here was with a friend and I was rather hesistant as I liked Gyros, but this place came across as more indian inspired gyros and I'm not a big fan of indian food. But I'm so glad I gave them a shot because the food its delicious! I've been here on multiple occasions now and they never fail to put out delicious food and wonderful customer service. The last time my boyfriend and I went here I misjudged how much our food would be and came out $2 short-- as I tried to change 1 of our meals to just a gyro, the guy at the register insisted it was fine and just come back on a different day with the $2! Can't find many places that would do that and can't find many people who are that kind. Good for the price--but it's still just a gyro. They can go a little overboard on the sauce, but overall pretty tasty for a low cost. Has been and will always &#160;be one of the best Falafel joints in Seattle. I've been eating eating there for 20 years always consistent always delicious. When I was a teen, I would visit my brother in Seattle for a week in the summer. He was a student at the U. While he was in class, I would walk up and down The Ave. I perused the shops on that oozed nag champa, bought vintage goods, smoked cigarettes and sipped coffee all while hoping someone would mistake me for a college student. &#160;A lot has changed on the Ave since then, but Aladdin's is the same. This is very typical street food. There is nothing fancy or formal. What you get is straight up delicious gyros. If you haven't been brave enough to try a lamb gyro before, try one here. You will be delighted. Their french fries are also delicious. As a side dish girl, that is important to me and they do not disappoint. It's great to know that year after year, this shop still stands and serves me the same delicious meal each and every time. My favorite place to eat in the U District. The first time I ever had a gyro, it was here. The lamb and beef gyro is REALLY good, the meat is really soft and the flavor is great. Kinda smoky, but not too smoky. Also, the pita bread they use in their wraps is pretty good too. I love, love, love their falafel. Its crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside with great seasoning. If you get the falafel as a wrap, you will no doubt fall in love with their tsatziki sauce. The lentil soup is really good, and its the perfect thing to eat to warm you up on a cold day. The fries are fantastic with the hot sauce too. OOH but make sure you go to this location instead of their other one nearby, this one is definitely the better one in terms of taste and service. Four stars, as yelp conveniently tells you when you begin to write a review, means "Yay! I'm a fan." It does not mean "Yay, the bathrooms were clean" or "Yay, they would pass the health inspection" or "Yay, this place is classy." I think a lot of people who review on yelp need to remember this. You don't go in to a gyro joint on the Ave and expect glass table-tops and a waiter. You expect an amazing 7 dollar gyro, and that's what you get. Great deal for the food and flavor - I will be coming back here often, they know what they are doing. And the anti-Israeli propaganda on the walls just completes the experience!But yes, as many have stated, don't forget cash! Visiting UW for a conference and popped by here because of Yelp reviews. I'm glad I did.The join is a bit small. Definitely a place to pop in, grab your order and walk around the streets eating. Reinder: Cash only! There's an ATM inside, but skip the time &amp; fees - come here prepared!Their lamb gyros is delicious! Moist, flavorful, peppery, exquisite. They make everything right in front of you quickly to fulfill that beastly appetite.The fries are killer. Wow. I was a bit surprised - they were crispy and flavorful. That seasoning must be magic.
This is the only place I go to get Hot Stone Pot Bibimbap. Huge portion, served with miso soup. It's huge mainly because of rice, but you also get all kinds of veggies (bean sprouts, carrots, zucchini, etc), beef, and a fried egg in it. Don't forget to add the sauce in it. It's not as spicy as it looks.I also recommend their chap jae and ddokboki as well :)I haven't had their sushi, but they do look very appetizing.This place is not the cleanest restaurant on the ave, but I honestly think it's not that bad. I think it's because people have to clean up after themselves. Their staff do wipe &#160;the tables down when they can.Their frozen yogurt is pretty good too. Mehh. Ordered the chicken + katsu + gyoza combo. The heap of salad that comes with is really pointless. Could they stop dumping mounds of cheap lettuce that nobody likes to eat? It was half the plate, with squirted dressing. The katsu was burnt and very dry. If its burnt black, doesn't that indicate that you shouldn't serve it? The chicken was average at best. The gyoza had no crunch and tasted weird... All that for $9 or so. I guess it's not their specialty. My friend's plate of food was burnt too. What? Did they just cook everything at once and leave it cooking so they could get the food out faster? Because there were 5 of us and the food was out within 5 minutes, each. That's a plus, but THAT fast says my food was sitting around for centuries. I wouldn't come back again. touchwood, i havent found any bugs on my plate.. tofu teriyaki awesume.. jus love it. bad thing is no wifi I wouldn't eat it if it wasn't one of the closest places to the dorms. Semi-cheap food, but very oily. I liked my food. Counter lady was very nice. Seems pricey for having to bus your own tables and order at a counter though. Not really anything special. &#160;I've ordered combos that had teriyaki in it and rice and it's always been bleh. Not much vegetables given. &#160;Proportions are okay but the food itself isn't very tasty or satisfying. &#160;Leaves me wanting something more. &#160;It's cheap but not good. this place sucks. i go there, and will continue to go there, but it's an extremely mediocre restaurant. that said, it's basically supposed to be. people go there because it's cheap and fast; not because it rocks anyone's world.
Meh... Quick, cheap, and poor quality. Just like this review. UT is a catchphrase in Husky Jargon (closely related to Chinook Jargon, often used to confuse Cougars, and mildly disorient WWU students). What does it mean? Well, it means: "Starving, broke, studying too long, and need nourishment other than instant noodles".UT serves straight up half-decent teriyaki (meat with some teriyaki sauce on it) with some rice and a half-decent iceberg salad that probably came right out of the "iceberg salad mix" bag. Throw some Kikkoman on it, and there you go. A perfectly acceptable meal for 7-8 bucks, depending on what you ordered.While the food is. Well, alright. The portions are nice and huge, and will last for both lunch and dinner if you've had an energy bar for breakfast. Which is good, because of its excessively convenient location at 41st &amp; The Ave. Sometimes I just stop in just to get some food that'll last me the day because I'm already there. And that's probably good business for them.They just added a whole Korean menu, but I haven't yet been convinced that it would last me for the two meals rather than just for one meal, so I haven't partaken yet. Besides, there are plenty of Korean places around. Good sized portions for a good price, but the quality of food is hit or miss. The $1.00 cup of miso soup is always good. Tofu teriyaki is good as well. My meat eating friends have commented that the chicken is sometimes overdone. Overall, a good find. It's on the ave; it's clean and it offers huuuuge portions at cheap prices. Why in the world would you not like it?Plus the froyo they sell is pretty good too!Def. worth going to if you're around here and craving teryaki! I came back at a later date and tried the teriyaki chicken, thinking that it's probably simpler and might be better than the salmon. &#160;The sauce was still too sweet, and the chicken was kind of tough. &#160;I still like their ice cream, but I'll keep looking for a better teriyaki place close to campus. If I could rate this three 3 1/2 stars, I would. This is, in my opinion, the tastiest teriyaki place on The Ave. The restaurant is clean and spacious and they have two flat screen TV's (one in each room) usually tuned into sports. You bus your own table here, which isn't a big deal to me. &#160;I really don't know what else to say about teriyaki. BEST TERIYAKI ON THE AVE! &#160;And that's saying something. I love the sauce, sweetened with pineapple I think. The chicken teriyaki and general tso combo is amazing. And FroYo too? &#160;What's not to love? For the first two years of my UW experience I would always come here and get the chicken teryiaki. Other then the fact that the portions are huge, the food is sometimes very very bland, and at times undercooked. Many of my friends have complained that although UT is fast, it's sometimes too fast at getting its food out. Sometimes you just get done ordering a chicken teriyaki and its already out......at the place where your friends or you put your number waiting....I give it 3 stars however because it has my favorite meal ever!!!! CURRY DON KATSU!!!!!!!! IT IS A MUST! I love you UT but its again not as good quality when I compare it to Yummy Bites or even Nasai Teriyaki (a bit further up). For sure like a vast majority of the students and people who've come here, the main reason to come here is because of location....on the Ave. its quite literally the FIRST restaurant. Average Teriyaki place on the Ave. &#160;If you're hungry and want a fairly large portion. &#160;This is the place to go but it's quantity over quality. &#160;The food is all right. &#160;Never been horrible but never been amazing either. &#160;Always worth a shot to try those other teriyaki places on the ave. &#160;There are so many.Nothing special and its usually crowded. &#160;A good bang for your buck. A staple of the U-District. &#160;Competitive prices, with large portions. &#160;Close to campus, and consistent quality. &#160;Not exactly a nice place, but who cares? &#160;This is college, and you need the most calories for your limited funds.Bibimbap and teriyaki chicken/beef are the only things I've really had. Honestly, I really don't think the teriyaki here is very good. You do get quite a bit of food, but it's not insanely cheap. The meat is so-so, the salad is honestly a joke, and the froyo definitely isn't very good.I feel that it is better to just go to another one of the dozens of restaurants on the ave than to settle for this place.I understand that once in a while one does crave teriyaki, and this place satisfies this craving. I eat here all the time. &#160;Whether I'm in the mood for a quick Teriyaki on the run or a wonderful Korean fare, this place never disappoints. &#160;The food comes fast. &#160;It always tastes wonderful. &#160;And the frozen yogurt on a summers day? &#160;A little overpriced but completely worth it for a guilt free treat. I was going to give this two stars but I've only been here twice so I will probably give them another try and expect better next time.....Yes like everybody says the food portions here are quite large and the prices are really reasonable. I saw some combo plates coming out with twice as much meat as my dish had...Anyways came across this place and decided to try it out after hearing that it has "the best teriaki in seattle" hmmm....I ordered what everybody seems to order..chicken teriyaki of course....okay so I don't mind my food coming out super early and yes I don't even mind if you grill my chicken even before I order it....although pre-cooked food isn't always the ideal when it comes to meats...but please at least keep it at a reasonable temperature! it seemed to have come out of a microwave or something because after about five minutes it was room temperature...and I'm not about to finish an entire plate of teriyaki in five minutes! Good thing they had a big flat screen on the wall playing basketball......so ummmmm yeah,,,,,service was friendly! I've been here many times and went last week again. &#160;The food is still good and filling. &#160;Dweji bulgogi (spicy port) and tofu soup was split between me and one other person. &#160;Service is fast even with the place packed. &#160;The food came out nice and hot. &#160;My coworker who is starting to get into Korean food has never had these two dishes loved it as I did too! &#160;The portion for these two dishes is perfect to fill up two hungry ladies with a little left over.I've also gotten the yakisoba here before. &#160;It's huge. &#160;I've eaten a lot of yakisoba at other places and think this one is pretty decent. &#160;This is my go to place for Korean food on the Ave. I ordered kimchi soup (korean) and was so disappointed as well. At first when my food came out, I was so excited but then I realized that there was so much onion in the soup which made it seem like there was a lot of kimchi (cabbage) in it.. It was so spicy and didn't taste anything like kimchi soup. Not only that I got food poisoning right after I ate.. Don't think I will go back to this place again. I came here recently with my sister for a quick supper. &#160;I had the chicken/chicken katsu combo. &#160;It was quite tasty. &#160;It came with two scoops of rice and a salad. &#160;The portions were generous and the prices reasonable. &#160;The chicken was cooked perfectly. &#160;I didn't even need to add any extra teriyaki sauce, but I could see how others might. The only complaint I have is the amount of sauce for the katsu. &#160;It was just a small container. &#160;I could've used more of that. &#160;I will be coming here again.
Best. Teriyaki. Ever. Who's HUNGRY?I suppose when you're a hard working student at the University of Washington, you gotta find something cheap and filling to eat. &#160;University Teriyaki is definitely the place to go. &#160;Portions are enormous, especially if you order the teriyaki. &#160;Does quantity sacrifice taste? &#160;Definitely not! &#160;The food is great, and keeps me coming back for me. &#160;Additional to Korean and Japanese fare, frozen yogurt is available. &#160;It's a little icy, but will most likely satisfy your craving for fro yo. My absolute favorite item to order here is the seafood kimchi fried rice. &#160;It's more like bi bim bap because it is served in a stone bowl. &#160;The kimchi is rich and very flavorful and there is a fair amount of seafood in the bowl. &#160;The rice is cooked perfectly, win! &#160;I've also tried their soon du bu, which is delicious. &#160;There are countless pieces of tofu in the soup and you get a nice bowl of white rice with it. &#160;Sadly, you will not be served a variety of panchan. &#160;Only one plate of pickled radishes, which are alright.Great food, at a great price, let's go! It's a convenient place on the Ave. &#160;It's practically the first restaurant one would see if you approach from the University. &#160;The food was actually really good for the price. &#160;The food was served warm and fast, which is ideal in a university setting. &#160;For a University eat, it's definitely a great restaurant if you need something tastey and quick. The first Teriyaki place most UW students try. Average teriyaki / yakisoba.+ Large portions~ Nothing special about the flavor taste- $7 - not the cheapest teriyaki on the ave. Many alternatives exist.They have an assortment of odd Korean dishes, that might be appealing, but it's all about the teriyaki, and they're average. Average teriyaki and noodles, but great stone pot bibimbap. The convenience of this place is what keeps me coming back. Last fall quarter when I ran out of money on my dining plan with 2 weeks to go, this place was a godsend. I could order takeout over the phone, take the 5-10 min walk over there (barely going uphill) and my food would be ready by the time I got there. Getting to bring my food back fast sure beats having to walk a long way to eat somewhere by myself. I hate Teriyaki, so it may not be totally fair that I'm reviewing this place. But, I thought the presentation was nice for a quick Ave joint. This is more about the Korean food. I think its grand. My roommate for 2 years was from Korea, and I've got to say that the Korean food here is very similar to the restaurants she preferred while here. Portions are huge, but rice is often overcooked. That's why they lose a star. We came on a weekend day for lunch and it was dead, but its crazy during the week with students. The frozen yogurt is really awful. I literally think its frozen plain yogurt--I think that's what they advertise it as, and they aren't kidding. Great for a Teriyaki fix, but overall pretty lame. Gyoza are great, chicken is sometimes overcooked, and sometimes your food will be doused in Teriyaki sauce, while other times it will only have a slight drizzle. Not a fan of salad with Teriyaki either, I prefer steamed cabbage. Considering this is the closest restaurant from my apartment, it holds a dear place in my heart for emergency food. This is not to say the quality is the best. With a fairly large sample of meals, I've eliminated a lot of dishes I get here. I usually stick to spicy squid or chicken katsu. The kalbi and bulgogi is pretty good, although I've only had tastes. Other dishes including the chinese dishes and bibihmbap have an after taste of MSG that was not subtle. I strayed away from the chicken teriyaki dishes after I heard about some of the food handling practices from a friend. (I'll leave out the details on here). The portions are consistently large, although after the change in owners last year, the portions are smaller, but still filling. Decent food for a decent price. &#160;The tofu tariyaki is pretty good, &#160;and they have a nice selection. &#160;A fairly run-of-the-mill place for the U-District. You order your food in the back off a large wall menu (or frozen yogurt at the front take out window). I was tempted by a few Korean dishes and potato noddles with veggies- but ended up ordering the tofu teriyaki to-go. World Cup was on, and all eyes in the large seating area were glued to the jumbo wall flat screen. My food arrived in less than 5 minutes and the portion size was double the norm for $5.95. Lots of deep friend cubes of tofu in a very sweet and sticky teriyaki sauce with two scoops of rice and a "salad" with tangy &#160;"dressing". The rice was a little dry, but the tofu was very tasty- almost a guilty eat with all the sweetness and crispness.FYI's~* One of the best tangy natural frozen yogurts on The Ave- a small is under $3 and each topping is $.75- They have fruit/mochi/candies* Most teriyaki items are $6-9* Korean items, stirfy, house specials, undo, gyoza, etc are all on the menu* Have lots of veggie only or seafood only items on the menu FastGoodCheap I haven't been there in a little while since I graduated, but this was definitely a staple while at UW. I prefer Teriyaki first up on 52nd, but being close, this was where I'd go when I wanted Teriyaki. UT is not great, but for the price, the portions, and the fairly good seating it is a decent place. During rush hour, the line forms straight out the door (you'd think kids in college would be smart enough to do some wrapping around, especially those waiting for their food), but the service is fairly fast. The one entree I love about UT is the beef Teriyaki. It's some sort of pounded and 'softened' beef dish that I'll probably die of in a few years, but for beef, it tastes amazing. I've seen all the Korean food they started offering in recent years, but I've always stuck to the Teriyaki. I'll trust the Mexican cooks (no offense, just reality) far enough to make good Teriyaki, but I have doubts about them making bul goh ghi (crap, I can't even spell it and I'm Asian). Most of what everyone else says is true: decent teriyaki and at a decent price. Generous portions means I usually get 2 meals out of one dish. Initially I always got some variant of yakisoba or chicken teriyaki, but after a few trips I always go with a Korean dish now. From what I've had, the Jap Chai Bob (translucent mung bean noodles with beef and some veggies) is good though a bit greasy. Always ask for the Korean red sauce. Also add some black pepper and you're golden. Other Korean dishes I've had are the BeeBimBop (kimchee, egg, noodles, meat in a stainless steel bowl), the unappetizing Ja Jaeng Myun (black bean sauce and noodles), some Korean spare ribs on a hot plate (good but smaller portion and slightly tough and fatty).Staff is curt but helpful, and I really like the free hot tea. While definitely not the best I've had, the portions, price, and quality mean that it'll continue to be the go-to teriyaki place for me and other in my department.
This place has gone way downhill along with the rest of "The Ave". &#160;I used to eat here twice a week for their chicken teriyaki and gyoza combo, which was reasonably priced for such a great location. &#160;Nonetheless, UT has slipped into the eternal abyss of mediocrity that seems to engulf most of the restaurants around the University of Washington. &#160;Somewhere about 2005 they switched to a cardboard-based chicken and used the savings to pay for plasma-screen TVs. &#160;I couldn't eat enough rooster sauce to get the taste of hard gristle out of my mouth, so I stopped going there.Perhaps of interest to others would also be the King County health inspections of this place, which consistently turn up violations for UT:http://decadeonline.com/&#8230;My advice for this place, go back to the basics. &#160;UT lost its soul when it expanded its menu to korean food and now frozen yogurt. &#160;I'd like to see its namesake teriyaki return to an edible form. Blaring TV, patio by a stark parking lot, food that is just ok. &#160;My daughter liked this place for a two or three visits, but mainly from her enthusiasm for all things Japanese. &#160;The servers were nice, it may be a good value, but I can't recommend the dining experience. I come here every week for the chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu. The portions are big, and I especially like the katsu. The prices are competitive for the ave. Why 4 stars? I've noticed lately that ordering close to closing time can sometimes lead to a lack in quality.There's a lot of seating and the food is served fast.
They have a big menu that includes Korean stuff, but you should probably stick with teriyaki and yakisoba, both of which are incredibly good. &#160;The teriyaki sauce is delicious, it runs a touch sweeter than your average sauce. &#160; &#160;The yakisoba noodles are great, and the quantity you get can only be described as ridiculous. &#160;It just hits the spot. &#160;If you're a student at UW, sometimes you just get a craving for UT sometimes. &#160;It's admittedly pretty limited, but if you stick to ordering what they do right, teriyaki and yakisoba, you wont regret it.My only request is that they have an option for a smaller portion, I'd rather be able to pay 30% less and get %30 less, because the standard portion is just too massive. &#160;It could easily feed two average women; I'm a dude that likes to chow down and after about two thirds of it is gone, I'm only still eating because I cant stop.There are a lot of grumblings about service here, but I don't think it's fair. &#160;The place has seating, but it's really more cafe style. &#160;While they do bring you your food, you clear your table yourself. &#160;I have no gripes about this since they don't pretend to be a sit down restaurant with a waiter. &#160;It's a busy place, so I like ordering my food, grabbing my drink out of the case, and having my food brought to me within 5 minutes. &#160;Overall this place gets a thumbs up from me, it's one of my regular spots. Takes Husky Card - CheckMassive food portions - CheckQuick Service and Clean Environment - CheckUT is an awesome place for a college student to get food. The portions are massive and very reasonably priced, which makes for excellent left-overs. The food itself is almost always very good (Spicy Chicken Teriyaki ftw!) and well worthwhile. The Miso is also excellent. Definite must for any UW student. The first time I came here, the chicken (and that's how one should grade Teriyaki restaurants, the chicken) was moist, and delicious. The second time I came here, the chicken was overcooked and dry. The service is always fast but totally impersonal (if you go when it's not busy you might get your food before you sit down), but since the quality of the product is so inconsistent, I can't really advise you to come here. Also, the spicy Teriyaki is just their regular recipe plus cock sauce, so don't ask for it, just add the sauce yourself. This place has been a college staple for me for the past 3.5 years. Quick and cheap, with portions big enough to take home leftovers for a snack or second meal. I always get the chicken katsu and have never been disappointed.
Really not impressed, especially since this was where I had my first meal in Seattle. &#160;Service was slow and then they got my order wrong on top of it. &#160;I also think that $13 for the tiny salmon combo they gave me is a little pricey for the U-dist. My situation: I'm on campus on a holiday (so just about every food vendor is closed). I am hungry, have only 15 minutes, and the only form of money on me is my Husky card (so the business has to accept it as payment).I quickly walk over to the Ave and walk in to University Teriyaki (a spot I usually skip). It's busy (mostly students), but there's only one person ahead of me in line. I ask how long sushi would take. Discover that it's pre-made in the morning so it would only take 10 seconds. Usually I avoid that, but it's kind of perfect for my situation. They were out of the spicy tuna so I went for the California roll. Grab it and manage to make it back to work on time. Mission accomplished!The guy at the counter was nice.The sushi:+ for convenience- for tiny selection of rolls (Cali, spicy tuna, tempura)Quality- It looked better than I was expecting. Flavor was a bit lacking, but it was okay and filled me up. Didn't leave me with any gross feelings, so that's always a plus. I used to frequent this place often when I went to uw, but not as much anymore. Its usually very crowded during lunch time but in the summer and night its usually pretty easy to get in and out. The teriyaki is pretty good and I dug into their korean menu several time. The soondooboo is pretty good for a teriyaki joint, and there chachangmyun is not bad. The prices are a little high for a teriyaki quick service eatery. Overall, its a good place to go on off peak times and if your in the area. I've been here twice (twice!!!) and I won't wish their teriyaki upon my worst enemies. I was here with friends who thinks this is good -- or maybe they were trying to kill me... twice...I do agree that it's cheap and the portions are pretty big, but it's a big heap of nasty. How can teriyaki turn so wrong? Is it just me or did the rice portions shrink since a few years ago? &#160;Did Ichiro's rice portions shrink too? &#160;I ordered the spicy chicken and beef dish - chicken is what is to be expected but I was worried how the beef would turn out. &#160;Not bad! &#160;My friend and her sibling ordered soondooboo and dduk gook so they gave us some ggakdooghee (don't you just love my Konglish : D ) - the ggakdooghee was good! &#160;Not what I expected. &#160;I was happy to see that they now sell frozen yogurt and the price isn't bad for 3 toppings. &#160;$4.15 total for my small size w/ 2 toppings of mochi (i lovvvvvve mochi) and 1 topping of strawberries, 3 pieces which i sadly dropped on the table b/c my cup was overflowing. &#160;mmmMmmMMM.... Very good Teriyaki but, too expensive for what you get. &#160;I believe it is the most expensive Teriyaki on the Ave. &#160;It is also one of the most conveient for the UW campus so it gets a lot of traffic, sometimes there are no chairs around lunch time and service can take a while if you order anything but the regular chicken Teriyaki.Overall though, good quality Teriyaki. &#160;Yum! Get the Korean food -- that's where UT shines. Anything with kimchi is an instant win in my book, as a general rule.The reason UT is great? Even with the portion downsizing, I almost always have enough for two meals. Just make sure you come while it's busy, from about :25 - :35 after the hour during the school day [I know, counter intuitive!] -- it ensures that the food you're eating hasn't been sitting around too long -- yes, it's preprepped, but at least it's made within the last hour not the last three hours, amirite? :) Good food once we GOT it! &#160;The hasty cashier didn't give us a number, which we didn't know was a problem--being it was our first time to UT. &#160;But they recycle the numbers in the course of a few minutes, so someone else ended up with our order number and we had to get a new order number TEN MINUTES LATER when our friend, who ordered after us, had already finished his plate. &#160;We were in a rush, which really pissed me off. &#160;I understand you're busy, but that's just absentmindedness. &#160;It's chaos that they try to deliver your plates to your table even if you're taking out. &#160;I don't see why they can't just have people wait on the side to hear their order called and use the extra manpower to cook more. &#160;Only go here if you have no cash and NEED to use your huskycard for food. &#160;Even then...doesn't chipotle take the card? This place has a more diverse menu than most of the Ave's other teriyaki places. I usually order from the Korean section. The bibimpap is a safe choice. I've also enjoyed the stir-fried squid.I recently got some jajangmyeon to go, but I wasn't terribly impressed. For one thing, there was nearly a half hour wait. UT has never been fast, but this was a new high. Also, the food didn't travel well. Jajangmyeon consists of wheat noodles and salty black goop with meat and vegetables. (Mmm, salty black goop. I should be a food writer.) By the time I got back to my desk, the noodles had amalgamated into a somewhat slimy mass of noodliness. The goop was fine to begin with, but was a bit too salty to eat on its own once I eventually gave up on the noodles. Went well with the pickled daikon, though.Apart from this one bad experience, University Teriyaki might have gotten four stars. In any case, I can't give it any less than a three; I gave Ichiro a three, and UT is definitely better. Skip the teriyaki and the rest of the japanese menu, the Korean food is the reason to eat here. &#160;Excellent homestyle korean food with tteokbokki, and bebimbap. I've eaten here a couple times but the teriyaki's just not that good. &#160;Good portions, reasonable prices (although expensive for U-district teriyaki), and a clean, bright interior with flat-panel TVs on the wall. But I never could get excited about the grub. &#160;And, the fast casual-style service (order at the counter, pick up your own utensils, condiments and drinks) is a turn-off because, for the same price, you can get full sit-down service at other joints in this area. I LOVE UT, because it's cheap, pretty good, and the portions are decently sized. It's a #1 place on the Ave for UW students who live in the dorms and who live off campus and don't want to spend too much money. The food doesn't save all too well unless you eat it later that day or the next day. I love the beef teriyaki, but some of my Korean friends love the Korean plates as well. Don't expect fine dining here, but do expect to see tons of college students and kids from your classes.The yogurt isn't really yogurt, btw. It tastes like sorbet icecream. I would recommend the fruit toppings as opposed to the chocolate/candy toppings they offer. I got the chocolate toppings and wished I had chosen the fruits instead. when i first came to the UW i thought this was a good place. they're portions have gotten significantly smaller. maybe it's the convenience, but there are way better korean joints on the ave. the best would be Sunney's Cafe a little past 47th &#160;SOOOOO GOOD! they give an assortment of side dishes with your order too! love side dishes. go there instead, seriously. University Teriyaki is now open on Sundays! Too bad the quality has decreased so significantly, I don't think I want to go back anymore. It's been a good six months since I last ate at UT, and I feel like they've cheaped out on everything. &#160;The prices have remained, while the miso has been watered down, and the portions have shrunk -- and really UT, when you're still serving everything on gigantic plates, the smaller portions become very obvious. It's like you're taunting me.Maybe it's due in part to their decision to diversify. They now offer frozen yogurt, which is great since I love it. But there's nothing special there. And now, there's a display case of tacky jewelry and little teddy bears taking up valuable people watching table space near the window and caused them to squish all the tables in the second room together. Whaaaat is that about?The service is still as fast as ever, which is nice. And the taste, except for the miso, hasn't changed. The katsu is crispy and fresh and the teriyaki, like it or not, remains the same. Personally, I'm a fan. Thin sliced, tender meat smothered in thick teriyaki sauce. It's not amazing, but it's pretty good. Their tempura has always been off though. The batter leans much more towards English fish and chips than Japanese tempura. Eugh. And the salad dressing always leeks into the rice, which is never pleasant.Also, they spilled soup on my poor boyfriend's pants and didn't do shit about it. I know our server saw that he did it, he looked down and said "Oh, soup." And then walked away without so much as an apology or napkin. I did not like this place. The teriyaki is on the lower end of average. The last time I came in, the employees were all sitting at a table with huge plates of food (which, by the way, looked better than the food the customers were served) and when I ordered, one of the employees got up kind of grudgingly to take my order. About ten minutes into my food, I decided to buy a drink, and had to wait about five minutes before someone got up from the massive employee meal to help me.There are better, less crowded and more inexpensive places to get teriyaki on the ave.I will say that their frozen yogurt is good, though. In fact, that yogurt saved this place from getting one star.
I think their teriyaki sucks, so they should re-name themselves. &#160;Their rolls are ok. &#160;The one thing I did like was the Chinese Chicken salad, where the dressing was ridiculously addictive. &#160;Unfortunately, I felt extremely sick after eating here, two of the maybe 4 times I have gone in, including with the chicken salad. &#160;Now that I sense a pattern I will steer clear of the joint from now on. &#160;If you value your colon, I recommend you do the same. I sometimes have come here for lunch, and it is a good meal for a good price. But the reason I am writing this review today is that I tried their yummy Korean frozen yogurt, and it is tangy yogurt goodness. There is now a window set up in the second store front that they occupy, and you can come up off the street to buy or you can purchase inside. I had the plain flavor (which may be the only one?) topped with fresh strawberries. If you like the taste of real tangy yogurt, then you are going to like this stuff. best place to get frozen yogurt!and its so cheap too! Why is everybody hatin' on this place? &#160;I mean, it's the closest teriyaki place on the ave, they serve large portions, prices aren't too pricey, and they have a large selection of teriyaki and Korean food. &#160;Yes it isn't gourmet food but I like to come here for some ok-tasting spicy chicken teriyaki. &#160;The chicken katsu is pretty good too. &#160;I have been eating here for the past 4 years of college and I still love this place. &#160;This is a good place if you're hungry because they serve much larger portions than most of the teriyaki restaurants on the ave. I had to come back and revisit this place to let everyone know this place is the prime teriyaki spot in the UDis. The portions are unbelievable and the service is excellent. Friendly staff as well. Perfect lunch spot for any group of students. As a former UW student, I've eaten here multiple times. After 4 years of college life, you get selective on what you like on the Ave and tend to go to those places that are fairly consistent~ yup, and UT was that place for me.But maybe things have changed? (based on the poor reviews im seeing) I haven't been there since '05- I may be looking back on the college food more memorably than they actually were. ha. But I did like their chicken katsu the best. As a student, if your craving some Korean food- its the closest thing they got near campus. You gotta make do! But honestly, I dont think its too shabby.
Solid lunch spot. Dim sum for two wound up being over $40, which I would expect for dinner, and not lunch, which knocked off a star- other than getting the check, I enjoyed my food, everything was fresh tasting and seemingly not out of frozen bags, and the service was quick. I'd stick with the smaller plate items and avoid the steam trays- those are what racked up the bill total. I've eaten here many, many times as it's across the street from my office. Sometimes it's great; sometimes it's downright bad. When I first started eating here several years ago, I would say it was consistently good. Then, three or four years ago everything became greasy and I stopped coming. A friend had a party here a couple of years ago and the food was good again so I came back. Since then it's been hit and miss and last week was definitely a miss so much so that I don't think I'll be back for quite awhile. I still love the Honey Walnut Prawns and the baked bbq Bao -- those are the only 2 items that were good last week. The potstickers were thick and gummy; the noodles dry and flavorless; the pork ribs were so badly cut that when you tried to eat them, bone shards broke off in your mouth (resulting in the ever lovely napkin spit) and they were also mostly fat; the Chinese broccoli was greasy (and as such it's impossible to eat with chopsticks). I'd venture further south to the International District for dim sum and skip O'Asian. $30-something for two people to eat dim sum? &#160;Naaaaaaaaah.Walk the extra blocks to the International District. &#160;Your wallet, stomach, and ass will thank you. They &#160;were lightning quick and super focused for the first fifteen minutes we were there and after that it was like trying to get a humming bird to come to an almost empty feeder. They also really push the DimSum. It was cold, I had a cold . I ordered soup. The beef with hand shaved noodle soup was extremely tender but too much for one person.The DimSum lady came by several times after we ordered off the menu and had a hard time giving us space. We sat for half an hour sipping tea &#160;and waiting from someone to take payment after they handed us our bill. We had to find our server. I would not recommend it even though I enjoyed the food. The service was way too erratic. Nice decor but dinner was not impressive. I've heard great things about lunch, though. Very good dim sum. &#160;All of the favorites that you would expect from a good dim sum place. &#160;Very friendly servers. &#160;Not pushy.
Crazy Man just Crazy there are like 3 different places called Saigon Deli at this intersection but this one is on Jackson just west of twelfthand with $2 pork Banh Mi you can't go wrong, I am going to Indiana for work so I went in and got 6 Pork &#160;Bahn MI for $12, that 3 day worth of food for my trip, just need some snacks to go along with it and I am hooked the fuck up Best banh mi in Puget Sound! I found this place by accident years ago and make it a point to stop by whenever I get the chance. My favorite is their xiu mai (meat ball) bahn mi and the tofu. Their spring rolls are tasty and the hum baos are yummy. They have good iced coffee and bubble tea. The only thing I have against them is when I ordered a vegetarian banh mi, they prepared the sandwich using the same bowl used earlier with other meats. Although I am not a vegan, if I was, it wouldn't be cool. &#160;Another great deal is their combo lunch: $3.50 for two items and rice! The preferred method of payment is cash, but they do accepts credit cards (they have a $5.00 minimum and charge a $0.50 surcharge for using a card.) The staff is super-friendly and fast. YES!!!!!!!! Oh my God I love this place, with its $2 sammiches (I'm a shredded pork girl through and through, they put tripe in it which I love!), unlabeled mystery foods, and quick service. I'll never abandon you, Saigon Deli!
Nifty online ordering widget, pretty good timing on delivery.Friendly staff, especially the delivery guy. Nice guy.Wings were good (on average)--flavor was great, texture was meh.Pizza was OK. Beau said it did nothing for him, but I say it's at least as good as what we'd get out of a box. Ah...screw this stiff upper lip crap. Seattle! WTF? When the hell are you going to figure out pizza? Palermo is located snugly on the north eastern part of Capitol Hill. &#160;Palermo is among the most versatile of the Italian restaurants in Seattle offering up above average dishes in their entire menu (not a single weakness as far as food is concerned!!!!) OH MYLANTA the cal zones and pizzas are amazing! Their dinner salads are equipped fully with lettuce, tomatoes and oh so sweet onions!! and homemade Italian dressing is too good!!!BUT... as I read the other reviews some of the other yelpers spoke of their staff and service as "sweet" or "friendly." &#160;Not sure what's up with this place but my roommate and I have received consistent, unfriendly service here each time we've gone. And it can't be us, we never bring a poor or rude attitude ever to the people that prepare our food or seat us (remember, if you're mean to them..they may be mean to your food) we take the hits as friendly as possible and we always smile and say thank you and tip the restaurant well. I am saddened :*( because despite the rough treatment my roommate and I receive (Not only when we dine in but when we order delivery!) we still come back because we hope one time, they'll greet us with a smile when we go through the doors or a smile over the phone. &#160;We also come back because the pizza and cal zones and salads are worth the rough treatment....What can I say about Palermo that hasn't been said about Terrel Owens? Very Good, speedy (dine in service), and cold and mean as all hell....but did I mention they were very good?I give them 4 stars because their food (crust makes the pizza, and their fluffy crust and sauces are among the best in Seattle)...I can't give them a 5 star because of the way I'm treated there but please please please....do not hesitate to come to this place if you're looking for great food! &#160;The decor and ambiance are great for dates and if you're legal to drink..their wine selection is the best I've seen for a pizza spot.If you're not in the mood for pizza, try one of their cal zones or build your own! Total for my roommate and I for two "build your own cal zones" and three toppings was about 21 bucks. For pizza I decided to try something different last time. I requested they mix their white Alfredo sauce with their marinara sauce and....lets just say this slender Filipino finished 75% of his large sized pizza and salad.Go for the great food and if you're lucky..you may even get amazing service too...like always folks! Take care of your wait staff, smile, chat it up with them even if they seem to be rude to you. &#160;May be they were &#160;having a bad day...and sometimes, a smile and a thank you can change it all round....hopefully. &#160;Happy Grubbing! &#160;:) The best pizza within delivery-distance of my house. &#160;SO much better than Pagliacci. &#160;Great crust (and the crust is my favorite part of the pizza - yes, I'm weird). &#160;I like the Greco (comes with tzatziki sauce!) and the Provencal pizzas. &#160;(Their eggplant topping is light-years better than Pagliacci's.)Salads and calzones are delicious too - I haven't tried any of the pasta dishes, but I hear they're good.And tonight I ordered online for the first time - so convenient! &#160;(Excellent for the antisocial types.) &#160;Although I did pick 7:45 as my delivery time, and I got the food around 7:20. &#160;But no biggie.p.s. &#160;Can I recommend my favorite pizza combination (which is not on the menu)? &#160;I call it the "Colin," after my friend who invented it - sausage, ricotta, and roasted garlic. &#160;Soooo good. Definitely one of the better pizza's I've had in Seattle... I go here for Pizza, and it's usually take out/delivery... Does this help? I need help/ palermo's has the best pizza in capitol/first hill...hands down. the toppings/varieties are endless and you can specify your pizza exactly to your liking- i have yet to be disappointed... coming from a relatively fussy eater, this is a great compliment!for me it's always the same: the pizza provencale, extra sauce (sometimes with pepperoni or canadian bacon), well done. i have tried many of the other pizzas but this is my pizza of choice and i doubt i will ever tire of it.i also have to mention that palermo's does the best eggplant in seattle. if &#160;whatever you are ordering includes eggplant, it's bound to be good.the sandwhiches here are ok...nothing special and i would definitely steer clear of the gyros...not at all the real deal.their appetizers are surprisingly good though- favourites include the baked cauliflower and the mediterranean platter. just make sure &#160;to ask for extra pita bread...the portions are huge and i always run out.the piato mediterrano is awesome as well but you will need to specify that you are ordering the special (eggplant, roasted peppers,mushrooms &#160;that are baked in a marinara sauce with mozeralla and gorgonzola cheese)and not the appetizer or you will wind up w/ the mediterranean &#160;platter (baba ghanouj, hummus, artichoke spread and kalamata olives).one last note: the staff are very considerate- one time they screwed up my order by giving &#160;me someone else's...not only did they have my order remade and to my doorstep less then 15 minutes later but they also let me keep the other person's order, free of charge. i had enough food to last for three days...all for under 20.00!go palermo's!!! I actually am talking about Palermo in Ballard ... AMAZING! I got delivery last night and was amazed, but it was even better as leftovers today. My roommate and I were just talking about how we don't have a good Italian place in Ballard (Lombardi's just doesn't cut it) and then she came upon Palermo, which I think just opened. I got the Lasagna and it was great -- enough for two meals for myself. It comes with a side salad and garlic bread -- what's not to love?! I definitely recommend this place and I can't wait to try their pizza. My husband eats only one meal a day, so if it were up to him, I would starve (let me be a little dramatic, people, it's my birthday). &#160;I eat no less than 8 times a day. &#160;It takes many meals to keep these wheels turning. &#160;If it is 2pm on Saturday and I have yet to eat anything, we are nearing the point of disaster. &#160;I was entering the hypoglycemic, hallucinogenic brink of disaster where I have been known to say things like "I don't care if I haven't eaten cow in years, I'll take a cheeseburger," when I literally stumbled upon the simple loveliness of Palermo. &#160;All I can say is "thank you" to the lucky fairy who lead me in the doors. &#160;This place is pure goodness from the sweet staff to the yummy Mediterranean salad and garlic bread to the appropriate wine selection. &#160;I ate well, enjoyed the unpretentious atmosphere and left with my moral compass intact. &#160;Yum. I love this place! &#160;It is a wonderful place to go to for a relaxing dinner. &#160;Cozy decor, and the staff are very friendly and helpful. &#160; The pasta dishes are amazing. &#160;Even though they do not have a pasta dish with pesto (strange right?), but they have a fantastic gorgonzola cream sauce dish! &#160;They also deliver. &#160;That's when I discovered the pizza. &#160;And online ordering. &#160;It is that much easier to disconnect from human contact if you are wanting to hole up and watch football. &#160;Or Court TV. &#160;Or, if you are lucky, the Golden Girls. &#160;But don't let my tv choices sway you from the food at Palermo. &#160;Nice family-run business! I love Palermo for a number of reasons. For starters, you can get lunch there at 3pm on a Sunday, which can be remarkably difficult to do if you want something a bit nicer than Jack in the Box. Also, they have not yet embarrassed me in front of my friends or family by suddenly developing crappy food or service, as so often happens when I introduce people to my favorite restaurants. Beyond that, the food and service are consistently good. I have eaten pizza, pasta, salads and appetizers there and they have all been tasty. Best pizza in Seattle? I don't know about that--but it *is* pretty damn good.Oh, and everyone who works there is stunning. First, this review is for the Ballard location which appears to be owned/run by the same people as the boxes still have the Cap Hill info on them.Second, pizza comes in so many styles that it's impossible to say what "the best" pizza is. &#160;To me there's three things essential to a good pizza; dough, sauce, cheese. &#160; It's essentially the foundation of the whole pizza experience and if one is lacking it can derail the whole thing.Now on to the opinion, er review. &#160;Have to say that I was disappointed, but really wanted to like these guys. &#160;They were very nice when I called in my order, delivery was quick and the delivery guy was nice as well (I'm quickly getting accustomed to guys that just finished their toke before they ring the buzzer and stand their like a zombie when you answer the door). &#160;Judging from the other reviews, I mean opinions (honestly how many of us really have what it takes to write an qualified review?) I'll try them again and go with a regular entree or salad rather than a pizza. &#160;Maybe it was that it was delivered but I found it was very light on the sauce (and I usually ask for light sauce), heavy on the cheese and the dough was rubbery and soggy. &#160;It's not the worst pizza I've had in Seattle (that still goes to Domino's which seems universal no matter where you're at), but it's not the best. &#160;For reference it was a Margherita pizza in case I might have picked the black sheep of the flock from their menu. &#160;If I find that their other dishes fare better than I'll up my review.While I'm new to the area I still have a lot of potential places in Seattle to find that perfect pie, but so far I haven't found anything that rates over 3 stars and I'm running out of options in Ballard.
Pretty darn good, and delivery until 3 am? That's very necessary.We've never ordered a pizza from here, but they have so much more than pizza anyway, including a full list of salads, fish and chips, burgers and sandwiches.They've got fantastic fettuccine alfredo (though there weren't enough prawns for my taste) and calzones. The BBQ chicken sandwich is wonderful. Great hot wings: big, meaty and flavorful.How's the service? Well, they've never been rude to me but they're not the friendliest folks either. But then, it takes something blatant to piss me off. I am baffled by the good reviews for Pronto. &#160;My co-worker and I ordered a pizza from here during one of the major snow days this month. &#160;We both usually go home for lunch but since the snow was so bad we had a pizza delivered to the office instead.We checked reviews ahead of time and went with Pronto because it had such great reviews, but unfortunately we were sorely disappointed when the pie arrived. &#160;We ended up ordering the Florence. &#160;The delivery time was fairly reasonable, but the pizza itself was not good. &#160;There was wayyy too much cheese and hardly any sauce (although probably for the best because the sauce wasn't that great). &#160;But the worst part was that the greasiness of the pie was unbearable...I mean, we are talking grease seeping through the box and onto every surface the box touched....just wayyy too much - ew!I felt pretty badly after eating the pizza too, which doesn't win this place any additional points. "Hey, I really like your food, just not enough to come and get it."THEY DELIVER! More than just pizza, burgers, pasta dishes, salads, fish n chips. (fish is good if dinning their, when delivered... hope you like rubber), They deliver late too! Almost everything I have had here is really good. I like the variety. I don't always want pizza and that's usually the only thing you can get delivered. Maybe I'm lazy, Sometimes I work late and its convenient. Any restaurant that has a wide variety of cuisine on their menu is always suspicious to me. &#160;(Pizzas! &#160;Burgers! &#160;Fish and Chips! &#160;Sandwiches!) &#160;It screams, "we do everything kind of okay, but nothing really well." &#160;Pronto is one of those places. &#160;For the prices they change, the quality is not great. &#160;How is it possible for a non-pan pizza to get so oily? &#160;I can't tell you a thing about the actual store-front, as nothing I've had delivered has made me want to go there.I keep getting suckered into ordering from them for two reasons: awesome delivery hours (rarity in Magnolia) and the coupon that gives you buffalo wings and 2 sodas (retail price $8.25) for free with a large or extra-large pie.Every other month or so, I repeat the cycle of thinking "it will be better this time" only to be disappointed. &#160;It's been a few months since I ordered from them, so maybe I'm finally becoming a stronger person. Late-night favorite... actually, the only place that delivers until 3am in my 'hood.Solid pizza, solid pasta, solid sandwiches.Delivery until 3am... SOLID. After a club night, we went to a friend's house in Downtown and I was really feeling like Pasta.Ordered from this place and it was great late night food. I got the Spaghetti and Garlic Bread.Tasted great, open late. 4 stars in my book! Fast delivery, good selection, average quality. I order from them all the time. Where else can you get a burger delivered. Not the greatest burger but not bad. Fish and chips too. Weird. The pepperoni is great!
This place has great food! It was one of those cold days and I was craving warm filling Chinese food. This place did not disappoint. The service was fast and friendly and the food was fresh and hot. This place is super small maybe 10 tables or so that are always full. on a negative note, they do not give free refills on your pop. Verdict: I would probably return. Best Chinese delivery in Seattle. &#160;I order from them often enough that they remember me, and once they even gave me a frequent customer discount. &#160;Another time, when they were out of something I wanted, they gave me free almond cookies as an apology.Pretty much everything we've tried we've liked, except the egg rolls, I don't recommend those. &#160;But our favorites are: General Tao's Chicken, Eggplant with Spicy Garlic Sauce, Broccoli with Oyster Sauce, Beef with Broccoli, fried Pot Stickers, Prawns with Honey Glazed Walnuts, BBQ Pork with String Beans, and their Fried Rice. &#160;Also, a massive takeout box filled to the brim with delicious fried rice, free with every delivery over $35. &#160;How can you not love that? The food's pretty good, but the seating is EXTREMELY cramped. My husband is only 140 lbs and even he felt cramped here. The view's good, the service is friendly, but the lack of space really detracts from the positives. Enough that I won't be eating in again, that's for sure. Since I work downtown, I'm always on the lookout for new and exciting places to eat in the market. Despite the rather boring name, Pike Place Chinese Cuisine has everything you'd want in a market restaurant - comfortable seating, reasonable prices, and consistent entrees that taste pretty darn good.The first time I went there, I tried the Sweet and Sour Chicken and a half-order of Chicken Fried Rice. The entree wasn't very good, but the fried rice was amazing! Since the maiden voyage, I've been back about once a week, ordering the same thing every time - Chicken Fried Rice and a water. Every time, the portion (large) and the quality (excellent) are consistent, which is exactly what I'm looking for when I pick out a regular lunch stop on the waterfront. The check's always $9.08 and the service is always above-average - and the food comes out extremely quickly!Highly recommend! Nothing to write home about. &#160;We got the garlic chicken on the lunch menu and it was great after we put in tons of hot oil w/ crushed peppers. &#160;the singapore curry noodles (the yellow ones) was good too, but i've had better elsewhere.-dhy I am snacking on some delicious General Tso's chicken and some of their special fried rice. This place is magic! So hubby and I decided to stop here with the kiddos for ounch on our day at the Market. With the Market being so crowded and having 3 young kids to tote a long (including a petulant 2 1/2 yr old) we just wanted to find a place with tables (see not asking much, are we?). So we gave this place a try. When we first went in there were only a handful of customers so we got decent seating though the place IS a bit cramped. We got our drinks, soup, and egg rolls served right away but the weird thing? My husband asked how many egg rolls in an order and the waitress told him 4. Well...it was more like 2 full sized egg rolls cut in half to make 4 pieces. So that was kind of misleading. We ordered 3 entrees for us and the kids to share: the beef and broccoli, beef with oyster sauce, and garlic chicken. All pretty good but for the price I think we should have had fuller plates. We spent $54 for 3 entrees, the egg rolls, drinks, and soup that only our strange little tofu-eating 6 yr old son would eat, lol. Overall the food was ok, I could see eating here again in a pinch but not the best value for Chinese food.
I've been to many sushi places here in Seattle as well as the Eastside (I live in Kirkland), and while Shiro's is good, it's certainly nothing to go out of your way for. &#160;Here's my take on Shiro's:Pro:very fresh fishplenty of waitstaffCon:price, or rather, priceywhile there were plenty of waitstaff, it still took a while to fill my water/tealack of variety in rollssmall, cramped tablesWe had mostly nigiri sushi--albacore, salmon roe, unagi, tamago, amaebi, salmon. &#160;And while I won't dispute that the fish was fresh, some of the cuts were sloppy. &#160;Our meal also ran ~$10 to $15 more than what you would pay for at, say, an equivalent Eastside sushi house (like at Tuna H., or I Love 'you know what'). &#160;Overall, probably more like 2.5 stars, but I rounded up to 3 (rather than rounding down) because they didn't do anything wrong--just a bit overpriced, and lack of roll creativity. This is probably the 6th time we been to Shiro, 3 times before they sold it and couple times afterward. &#160;Tonight, we make a reservation knowing Shiro will be working (Tried the other chef once, didn't think sashimi taste as good) and it was a great experience.We ordered 50.00 sashimi omakase style (chef's choice of fish, tonight we got 18 pieces, including the seasonal uni), black cod, saute geoduck, dynamite (seafood baked with Jap mayo), and also two extra pieces of yellowtail and geoduck sushi (I love geoduck!!). &#160;All seafood are fresh and everything was prepared perfectly, plus service was great! &#160;I am happy to know that they still has it. &#160;I was disappointed once with the other chef and thought the overall food quality has downgraded but with tonight's food. &#160;I am happy to report it is still good - just pick the night Shiro is working :PTips - always make reservation when Shiro is working (check his schedule - usually Tue, Thur, and Sat). &#160;If you want to sit at the sushi bar, come early - like right when they open at 5:00 otherwise it's really testing your luck. What a great way to end 2009. Had dinner here on NYE and was fully satisfied with the experience.Started with kumamoto oysters which were amazing, agedashi tofu - always a favorite, geoduck butter yaki - this one actually sounded yummier than it tasted, &amp; omakase platter with a bottle of kirin &amp; sake, of course!The sashimi was mindblowing....melted in your mouth...extremely fresh - you did not need any soy sauce or wasabi with it at all. My bf was very impressed and said it was the best sashimi he has eaten ever. Now, that is a bold statement because we have had our fair share of fish - I have to say that it's the best I have eaten thus far as well. Our waitress was so cute &amp; helpful - &amp; I liked the "home-y" feel to the restaurant. It has it's own ambiance - nothing fancy, but a warmth to it. Also, having Shiro behind the sushi bar doing his thing (such a cute old man) completed the experience. Cheers to tasty foodie adventures in 2010. This is the best sushi I've ever had and it was the most fun I'd ever had while eating sushi as well!My boyfriend and I went here on a weekday night, so it wasn't crowed at all. We were able to sit at the bar and watch them make everything.The men behind the counter were so much fun, talking and engaging with everyone, while still making sushi that looked beautiful. At one point I ordered a shrimp sushi and he brought out a fresh, still alive shrimp and cracked it right there. My boyfriend got one next and they let him crack the shrimp himself. Then they convinced us to try the heads of the shrimp too (tasted OK, but hard to get over that I was eating a head!)We had great service, great food. The scallop sushi... so amazing! Melts in your mouth like butter. Even more so, when we went to pay our card was denied because our bank had made a huge mistake earlier that day and over drafted our account by $300! We had no idea, but they were kind enough to lower our bill to the amount of cash we had on hand. This really meant a lot to us. We can't wait to go back and tip them like crazy!Shiros is great, give it a try for sure! I've now been in Seattle long enough to have experienced a significant number of its sushi stops, so I think it's time I update my review of Shiro's to make it more "definitive."Let's start with this: I think Shiro's has the best sushi in Seattle. I've tried many of the others, but keep returning to Shiro-san's joint. &#160;I will not argue that Shiro's has the most interesting or elaborate rolls , or that it has the most creative menu (Umi and Nishino can fight for those honors). &#160;What Shiro's does have is really fresh, traditional style japanese food in a very friendly environment run by actual Japanese people.The best way to experience Shiro's is at the sushi bar, where your dinner will be custom-created by one of its talented sushi chefs. &#160;They manage to make magic with slight twists on classics (like cured Tuna or Salmon with sea salt and meyer lemon), and will prompt you to try new things.If you prefer your food cooked, Shiro's has delicious teriyaki (which I almost never order since I tend to stick to sushi) and an array of other dishes like black cod, udon, and 3 different varieties of miso soup.My personal recommendations are:-Anything involving salmon-Ama-ebi (sweet shrimp) which they will kill right in front of you-The Belltown Poke, a sort of tuna salad with raw tuna in a spicy sauce-Albacore Tuna ngiri-Whatever they recommend when you ask "what's good today?"Writing this is making my hungry . . . I think I need to call Shiro's and make a reservation for this weekend! This sushi restaurant came highly recommended from a Seattle resident as the best sushi in Seattle. I agree. I ordered my usual: salmon sushi, yellow tail sushi and salmon skin roll. The sushi chef did not give me wasabi, so I asked for it. He said try the salmon first without soy sauce. He sprinkled rock salt and it already had wasabi. It was like butter. Totally melted in my mouth. I had to order more salmon to go. The only negative, which is similar to NewYork, sushi came with 1, not 2 pieces. So that's why prices looked inexpensive. I wish they would indicate on the sushi menu that it is one, not two pieces.Nothing fancy. pretty small and very casual. But i loved the freshness. Salmon skin roll was just okay. Also, the sushi rice is very good, which I didn't realize until later that it was probably the best sushi rice I've ever tasted.I wish they were opened for lunch. Cause i would have come back the next day and eaten for lunch before getting on a plane. Located in the chic Belltown, Shiro's does not have a very chic interior, which can mean only one thing: if it's popular despite its plain look, the food must be pretty fantastic. &#160;My husband and I shared ankimo, black cod, hotate nigiri, uni nigiri, hamachi nigiri, spanish mackerel nigiri, and tomago nigiri. &#160;All were fresh and very well prepared. &#160;My husband especially liked the uni, which was not fishy at all. &#160;Price is a bit on the high end, which is well justified for the quality of the fish. If you're going to go to one restaurant in Seattle--go here, right now. Put down your computer, run to Shiro's, and get the omakase. Just tell Shiro to do his thing--you won't regret it, and I guarantee you'll try stuff you've never even imagined like amazing smelt sushi (no, really) right from Puget Sound. This is how it's supposed to be--no frills, no thumping music (no music of any kind, in fact--you're here to eat, not to make the scene), and a pleasant (if slightly gruff) old guy (that would be Shiro) behind the counter who's a genius with a knife. Everything's super-fresh, 100% in season, I'm telling you, it's going to be good--let Shiro do his magic and you won't be disappointed. And if you don't believe me (I am, after all, just some guy), then believe Ichiro, for heaven's sake--this is where he goes. When one of the greatest pure hitters the game has ever known wants to feel like he's back home, he heads to Shiro's. I rest my case. Go. Like right now. In my opinion, Shiros and Nishinos are two of the best sushi places to go inside of Seattle. The fish is fish is absolutely fresh and the people are extremely friendly.If you see fresh Uni (sea urchin), I'd totally recommend giving it a try. Usually, it's pretty hit or miss, and its a treat when Shiro's serves it (I think it's caught locally). The price, although a little bit on the high side... completely worth it! "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" is right! Let me preface this review with that I generally don't review places that have a high number of reviews. HOWEVER, I was so blown away by Shiro's that I must contribute my two cents. First off, do not listen to the concierge at the Westin, it is NOT "too far to walk to". She lied. LIED! She steered us over to Red Fin Japanese inside of the Hotel Max (another review coming up!). We had a mediocre to bizarre experience that left us wanting more. So, with that, we went to Shiro's!I have never in my sushi eating career have seen that many actual Japanese people eating inside of a sushi restaurant before. When we got there, a train of Japanese business men were leaving and singing the praises of Shiro. Sounds like we were in for a treat. Since we had eaten at Red Fin prior to this, we did not order the usual amount of sushi that we normally would. But we did gather a nice sampling of their menu. We ordered one of their sushi dinner that came with nine pieces of nigiri (chef's choice) as well as half of a small roll (we ordered spicy tuna), the blackcod kasuzuke and a few pieces of unagi and salmon nigiri (just in case). [Note: THEY MAKE THEIR OWN SOY SAUCE to "preserve the integrity of the fish". WOW. Hello!]The service was superb and our server was very sweet - kind of like ordering from your best friend's mom. The dinner came with a heavenly bowl of miso soup as well as some lightly pickled cucumber and some cooked small shrimp. Let me say that it was by far the best miso soup I've ever had. Everyone at the table agreed. As if it was sent from the gods...but I digress.Then our sushi arrived...tada! As many other people have said, the fish just MELTED as soon as it hits your mouth. Great selection of nigiri - your standards and then not so standards. Unfortunately, the names elude me right now. Regardless, if you like REAL sushi and REAL fish, this is your spot. I was sad when it ended. I'm even more sad that I don't live in Seattle to eat at Shiro's all the time. Shiro's should be on your list of places to eat when you're in Seattle. This is probably the best authentic sushi I ever had. My friend and representative from John Varvatos "Ching" took me &amp; another associate there. He told me this would be killer sushi and it was. This sushi restaurant was featured in a GQ magazine and they actually ship unique fish straight from Japan. We ate only nigiri sushi but that's how they roll in Japan. We didn't even look at the menu, we just said bring it on! Over $300 dollars later we were done. I actually could of ate some more it was that good. I have eaten at Nobu in Vegas, Ozumo's, Zushi Puzzle, Sushi Rock, Kitaro, Sushi Groove, Blowfish Sushi, Deep Sushi, Masaki &amp; Chaya in San Francisco, Beverly Hills Sushi &amp; Kyoto Sushi in Los Angeles and this tops them all. It's definitely a once a month visit! Do me a favor can you please send me a message on your favorite sushi place. Traditional, Fresh and good!Shiro provides fresh, good fish that is prepared as simple as possible, and just the way you want it for a sushi house.I'd suggest anyone eat here if they are looking for good fresh sushi.The restaurant is quaint, service is good and hostess is very friendly.Parking can be difficult so if you see a spot open up, just take it even if it is 6 blocks away. So this is supposed to be the best sushi in Seattle. I would say it was very good sushi but I hope this is not the best i get out of the city. Our dinner was very delightful with the widest selection I have ever tried. Our sushi chef even went as far as making me a monkfish pate sushi and a raw oyster sushi. We order the chef's choice and continued eating until they ran out of ideas. It was a very enjoyable evening, including friendly foodies all around the bar. One person would order a unique piece and the entire sushi bar would also try together.All the fish was fresh and buttery with a larger selection than other local joints.This place was a joy to dine at! The chefs special is the way to order sushi. You have to trust them in their decisions. They would advise you on every piece, Soy sauce or no soy sauce. My only issue was the service from the waitress, we had to ask for water about 20 minutes after being seated and had to flag her down for about anything we wanted or needed. Other than that it was great sushi and would definitely recommend to anyone that enjoys sushi. We did spend over $200 for two people. One small bottle of sake, 2 beers, and sushi. FYI This place was spot on.I was craving nigiri and could not have chosen a better place.I was told they are given first pick of fish from several of the local fisherman. On that note, do yourself a favor and order plenty of salmon.Solid service. I'm not from Seattle so I have never had the straight out of the Puget Sound salmon that I can only imagine to be so exquisite. &#160;I did however have off-season salmon sashimi at Shiro's. &#160;Does that count? &#160;I know it's probably not as good as it is when it's in season but it's still ten times better than the stuff you get when you live in a landlocked city. &#160;It is some of the best salmon I've ever had. &#160;Everything else we ordered was just excellent. &#160;The melt in your mouth kind of sushi that you'll never forget. A little known fact about raw fish: if you order them at Shiro's Sushi, they WILL melt in your mouth. &#160;Seriously, ask my marine biology friends. &#160;That's the Shiro's Guarantee.The fish is really fresh, the rolls are diverse, the waitstaff are on top of their game, and the owner (manager?) is eager to direct you to the kind of rolls that would best suit you as an individual. &#160;And man, does she know what she's doing. &#160;Listen to the wise one! &#160;This is a great date spot. I have had several friends talk Shiro's up sooooo much. It was fine both times I visited, but the sushi was average and the atmosphere was nondescript. The service was polite and friendly, but nothing out of the ordinary. I appreciate that it is "traditional," stripped down, without any fusion cuisine gymnastics. But the quality of fish never caused me to contemplate calling up the family &amp; begging them to fly in from Tokyo to experience it. It was solid neighborhood sushi joint fare as far as I could tell, but not more than that.I would give Shiro's another chance because:--It was ok. Just like I might repeatedly go to the neighborhood sushi place, sure I'd come here again.--Maybe I've come on off nights. I don't remember exactly when I visited. But every city has its day when the fish market isn't open... maybe it was that day? The fish was definitely not bad, or "non-fresh," but it lacked the magical sushi meltyness.--They have Chawan-Mushi (egg custard) and Nasu Dengaku (miso eggplant) both of which I love, and neither of which are particularly common in this area. Both times I went, I ordered a basic sushi platter with tuna, salmon, mackerel, hamachi, yellowtail. No, it's not the majestic omakase that causes diners to faint. But the basic sushi platter is a test, for me. If the basics are stunningly good in their simplicity, with no need for a full omakase presentation, that's how you know you're in a top-quality sushi place. This wasn't of that quality, but it was good enough. I have no absolute complaints about Shiro's. I was only underwhelmed because it was so highly praised. If no one had hyped it up before I went, I would've been satisfied, if unfazed, with my meal. &#160;It's a good restaurant on its own terms. Here we go:- Poke- Ko iri ika no nizuke (squid with squid babies, stewed Japanese style - don't knock it 'til you try it)- Kumamoto Oysters (local PNW)- Shiro maguro (white albacore nigiri)- Zuke maguro (tuna marinated in sake, soy sauce, mirin, etc., Japanese style for three hours)- Dobinn mushi (clear soup served in small steel teapot, with matsutake, ginnan, ebi, tai, with a squeeze of key lime)- Hamachi- PNW local uni - Mirugai (geoduck clam)- Norway saba with shiro goma, shouga, shiso handroll- Negi toro- Ikura to kannpyo - Ikashiso ume no temaki- Geso no gunkann- Kohada- Unagi no tempura, tamago, to shiso no temaki...ok, so I got lazy to translate everything, but I'm Japanese. I speak and read Japanese -- as long as I understand, who cares...is what I really want to say, but I know that's not what a "good" reviewer does, so here is the comprehensive version. The itamae-san (sushi chef), Shiro-san is about 76ish and only stands behind the counter three times out of the week. Shiro-san trained under THE Jiro-san of the infamous Sukiyabashi Jiro in Ginza. Needless to say, Shiro-san's skills are notch. Phenomenal. Amazing, and his craft is put well on display if you do an omakase (tasting menu) at the counter. One thing that stands out is Shiro-san utilizes local ingredients when he can, and resorts to "exotic" (i.e. fish from Japan, EU, etc.,), with fish that aren't available in the PNW. The reason why this is so amazing is because a lot of sushi restaurants (especially in SF / LA / NYC) sell themselves with "Fish from Japan! Japanese fish! Fresh imported fish served here!" and overcharge for fish that isn't even fresh. (One of my biggest pet peeves.) What foodies...err I mean, diners, need to comprehend is that just because an establishment's byline is fish from Japan, it doesn't necessary equate to the freshest or best fish -- ESPECIALLY in the PNW where the seafood is absolutely divine.Damnit. There I go digressing with another sushi rant. See? That's why I avoid detailed reviews, since I believe so many "foodies" have skewed fundamental views on dining and I don't feel as if it's in my place to lecture. ONWARD!Aside from his skills, the best part about Shiro-san is he treats patrons the same (no special treatment if you're Japanese -- ok, well, maybe just a little but not significantly like most establishments). I've never been to a sushi restaurant where everyone seated at the counter doing a tasting menu, receives the same orders. Especially since elite itame-sans born, bred, and trained in Japan like Shiro-san are snooty and biased toward Japanese patrons.The upside to that is, well, if you're not Japanese, you can be rest assured of any bias.The downside, is, well...as a full blown Japanese, I have to eat some...well...hmmm....Americanized dishes. To further elaborate: 1. there were way too many handrolls. 2. there were some items that were too rich --like his ponzu had more soy sauce than I am used to and 3. he put too much wasabi for my liking. Minor things, but things I noticed nevertheless. Overall, I love Shiro's and Shiro-san, but if you consider yourself a sushi snob, don't expect to get blown away by your first time. BUT. From the second visit on as Shiro-san gets to know your palate, prepare yourselves for every experience to keep getting better. And THAT my friends, is why Shiro's is so dangerous and one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the US. ps: special thank you to my friend Mark, who introduced me to Shiro-san and treated me to an amazing dinner. :) I was introduced to this place by a friend and right away it became my top 5 Sushi restaurants in Seattle area. I do not come here for ambiance, decor, rolls or cocktails, I come here for the fish! Although spendy, the quality of fish is very notable, I order various kinds of sashimi to taste the delicate flavor, sweetness and oiliness of my fish without the seasoned sticky rice. They also use various local ingredients wish is always a plus in my book. Some favorites include: Belltown Poke, Hamachi, Saba and and Shiro maguro! You will not be disappointed. Lorna D. had been raving about this place so much that I was dying to go! &#160;I immediately went for the $50 Omakase for myself. &#160;Meanwhile, Lorna D. wasn't so sure what to order (despite her previously fabulous experience there). &#160;So the waiter suggested he make the $50 Omakase for us to share. &#160;We figured that would be fine and we could order more later if we wanted. &#160;It did make me wonder what a $100 omakase would have included then.When the beautiful plate arrived, there were over 20 pieces of fish included (geoduck clam, red snapper, sockeye salmon, uni, mackerel, octopus, hamachi, and albacore). &#160;We also added an order of toro and amaebi for good measures. &#160;The fish was fresh and just really good. &#160;They do offer good quality sushi there.I guess my real problem that night was the service, or lack of rather. &#160;We were sitting at the sushi bar, and I'm used to engaging with the sushi chefs a little bit. &#160;This is usually the time I get to order whatever else they have fresh and want to sell. &#160;However, we didn't feel like we were encouraged to stay since they didn't ask us if we wanted anything else but started cleaning instead. &#160;(There were three sushi chefs at the counter, and only us and another party.) &#160;They pretty much focused all their attention to the girl sitting next to me, who seemed to be a former employee, and her friend &#160;(I can understand wanting to catch up with your old colleagues, but we felt like we were being ignored.) &#160;The wait staff never took our beverage orders, so we had to ask for tea, and eventually for refills on the tea. &#160;We had really planned on going all out during this dinner and spending a good amount of money, but it just wasn't happening! &#160;We really wanted to gorge on sushi! &#160;They didn't have any live uni on hand either. &#160;We asked if they had any specials, from the sushi bar or kitchen, they could recommend and they said they really didn't have much to offer. &#160;At one point, Lorna D. wanted to order some Chicken Karage because she enjoyed it the last time she was there, but hesitated since it appeared the kitchen might be closed based on the dynamics of the kitchen staff. &#160;Overall, I left Shiro's feeling underwhelmed. &#160;I had gone in with very high expectations on the quality of food and service. &#160;The fish was good, but the service was lacking. &#160;Sadly, I wouldn't return or recommend. Shiros is a splendid place to go for Sushi. &#160;I've been several times. &#160;They hit the highs when they are on, and it is some of the best sushi I've had when they nail it. &#160;Sometimes they are off though, and the sushi taste is just so-so.The restaurant is not very big, has a sushi bar and tables. &#160;The place is not super fancy, just good food. This place is AMAZING!!! We had reservations at 7:45, and am I glad I got them because the place was still packed when we left at 9:30! &#160;We were seated right away and the waitress was really nice! &#160;She explained everything to us and told us what the items on the menu were for the day. &#160;We decided on oysters for appetizers and the sashimi and sushi dinners. &#160;When the food came I was stunned. It was absolutely the best sushi I have ever had. &#160;The sashimi melts in your mouth and the rolls are absolutely to die for! &#160;It tastes as though the fish was caught that morning! &#160;It was well worth every penny we paid!!! Belltown has all the good sushi! This place is definitely traditional Japanese food. You cannot beat the service here! Our waitress was so polite and took the time to explain every single dish to us. She even sparked up conversation..real life conversation at an Asian restaurant. I don't know about everyone else..but every single Asian place I go to just seems to lack the customer service piece. We had the poke Belltown salad for an appetizer and it was delicious. The tuna was sooo fresh and the flavor was just right. I had the sashimi dinner and every single piece was the freshest piece of fish I've ever tasted. The tuna and salmon was simply divine..oh and the yellowtail! Yumm. My bf had the blackened cod..didn't really get to try it but he cleaned his plate..so must've been good. And for dessert..green tea and chocolate mochi. Drooooool. Gosh..I miss Seattle and if I ever live in the city..I'd live in Belltown just for all the good eats. I'll definitely be back here when I visit again! I may have written this disclaimer for other sushi reviews already but: I am not a sushi purist. I absolutely love sushi--sashimi, nigiri, rolls, hand rolls--and it is one of my very favorite foods; I love the taste and texture of fresh fish but I also, without fail, prepare a little puddle of soy sauce mixed with a whole lot of wasabi each time I eat sushi. While I can definitely taste the difference between solid, fresh fish and fish that has been improperly frozen or thawed, I am not one to pay exorbitant amounts for super-fresh fish and I am definitely not one to pay to eat sushi the super-traditional way without my little wasabi-soy sauce puddle. Here's where Shiro's comes in. The fish was definitely super fresh and the waitress kept saying that this-and-that item on the menu was locally caught fresh that day, that they didn't usually offer it but--lucky us!--they did have it that day. My boyfriend and I got a sashimi platter, the octopus appetizer, 2 hand rolls, and just a couple pieces of sweet shrimp and roe, which totaled $75 before tip. I think I am used to being a gluttonous sushi eater, so I wasn't quite satiated and $75 is a lot to pay for not feeling quite satiated and for not feeling quite comfortable. The entire night, the waitress kept trying to upsell and when we initially wanted to order some rolls in addition to sashimi, she dissuaded us since "Shiro's was the first sushi restaurant in Seattle and people come here to eat our specialty menu items and our sushi". Sure, what we had was delicious but it was also super expensive. As a frugal college student, I certainly didn't feel like my business was very welcomed at Shiro's. The waitresses and the rest of the staff were super nice and smile-y but the constant pressure to get expensive food was definitely not cool. If I ever got super rich and wanted to spend lots of money on sushi, I'd definitely come here but while I'm still trying to save my money...I'll be sticking happily to Umi and Maneki's, thank you very much! I'm biased. Shiro's was the first place I ever had sushi - from Shiro-san himself. I've been eating sushi for a few years now, but don't really know anything about sushi except that i don't like Urchin. I checked Shiro's out again on Wednesday evening and was impressed once again.The reason Shiro's gets 5 stars is because:-they serve exceptional sushi without pretentiousness-service is 6-star-I've never had a bad experience sitting down at the sushi bar and having them choose sushi for me (seriously, it's the best way to experience sushi here)Ideally, try to go on a night when Shiro-san is there (Tues/Thurs/Sat) Good sushi and reasonable priced, I still prefer Maneki over Shiro's, but service is much better here. Why is this place so highly rated? &#160;Maybe it's the best for Seattle but for LA this place is only better than average. &#160;I have been to hundreds of sushi restaurants and really know quality. &#160;The (sushi) rice here is only ok and it should be served warmer. &#160;There is also way too much of it on the sushi. &#160;The smelt fish was different and the highlight of the meal. &#160;Albacore was also delicious. &#160;We ordered the omakase and didn't specify the $50 omakase and so he kept going well beyond $50. &#160;My meal ended up at $70 with sharing the cost of one $15 sake bottle. &#160;I noticed the sushi menu prices seem reasonable but they are 'per piece'. &#160; I wouldn't come back here and if this is the best in Seattle, next time I'll consider ordering chicken. Shiros is a good sushi place that sticks to a very traditional style. &#160;Their service is usually very basic, so if you are looking for someone to hold you hand through the process, this isn't the place. &#160;Their fish is usually very fresh, but there isn't much variety to their menu. &#160;They also tend to charge a bit more than the people down the road. This is the best sushi in Seattle. Definitely a place to take out of towners when you want to impress them with the quality and uniqueness of Seattle seafood. The omakase (chef's choice) at the sushi bar is a blast. &#160;The most tantalizing presentations and efficient, if expensive, service. Excellent sushi. &#160;Try the Shiro's Special Wrap...it is very tasty. &#160;On our last visit, we had the Matsutake Mushroom Soup which is a seasonal item. &#160;It was also excellent. Shiro's is not for the faint of heart when it comes to sushi and sashimi. &#160;But if you appreciate good quality, Shiro's can't be beat. My husband and I were visiting Seattle for the week. &#160;We're from New York and I've been eating sushi my whole life, and I have high standards when it comes to sushi - I also do not believe that just because a place is trendy or expensive that the sushi is necessarily good. &#160;But this place was probably the best meal we had all week in Seattle. &#160;We did a $60 Omakase, which actually isn't that expensive when you remember it's for 2 people. &#160;They started us off with friend shrimp heads, which if you haven't tried them before, just go for it - it's worth it. &#160;The yellowtail melted in my mouth, and the pieces were nicely sized. &#160;The atmosphere is also great, really down to earth, as opposed to so many sushi places that seem to believe their restaurants have to feel like dance clubs to get you to frequent them. &#160;This place is the real deal - it's just about the good fish. &#160;The only downside is that the place is clearly a guidebook recommendation, so you get a lot of tourists who really don't know sushi and they just order the California rolls and stuff like that. &#160;But who cares - you enjoy your Omakase and let them eat their California rolls, and everyone goes home happy! Best sushi in Seattle. Fish is always fresh, there is always a great selection to try. You can find me here once to twice a week having the sushi dinner. It comes with shrimp and cucumber salad, and a miso soup. The sushi is 3 California pieces, a tekka maki (sometimes its a toro roll) and 9 pieces of chefs selection nigiri. For 25 bucks, you can't beat it. Also, the green tea is some of the best I've had. You can't go wrong with any of the sake selection. Recently tried geoduck and sea urchin for the first time. The chefs were very excited to have me try new things. next to maneki, best sushi i found in the city. the blinds are always drawn and you can never see in but peek inside and either sit at the bar or in the back room if you have a group. fun times. good sake selection too When I'm on travel, I never go to the same place twice during a trip.... of course.. I had never been to Shiro's before. &#160;The sushi is superb. &#160;Yes.. you can get california style sushi here, but I consider this place to also provide the 'ol' school traditional style sushi'. &#160;Live sweet shrimp, uber fresh local fish from seattle, and other fish flown in from different parts of the world. &#160;Decor and atmosphere is good. Awesome service and the chefs aren't snobby to the point where they won't serve you if you're not Japanese (or speak japanese). I went for the omakase two nights in a row, and each night it ranged from the 60-70 dollar range... a total steal for everything that I got. it was good... wasn't the best... service was okay.... but the fish wasn't as fresh as the restaurant in la.... only the salmon was really delicious... surprise surprise.. it's washington.. ;)i had toro, hamachi, uni, ikura, maguro, ajisome chicken karage, shishamo, ankimo, grilled octopus legs... pretty goodcali still has the best sushi hands down... My friends and I were out of towners in Seattle for a weekend, and came here on a declaration from a friend that Shiro's has the "best sashimi in the entire world." &#160;Well....how do you ignore a tip like that? &#160;We couldn't miss the best sashimi in the entire world! So we made reservations and came here. &#160;To our surprise it wasn't crazy packed, but that it probably also because it was later (8:30) and it was super rainy outside (althought Seattle-ites should be used to this). &#160;We ordered the special tuna sashimi, chicken karra-age, fried oysters, and shared a black cod meal that came with miso soup and sashimi. &#160;It was all SUPER good, especially the sashimi!! I'm not sure about it being the best in the world, but from the standpoint of my undeveloped palate, I thought it was melt-in-your-mouth fresh and totally satisfying. &#160;I only wished we had more of it. hahaha. After hearing about this place from a very reliable food crazy Korean friend, I had to check it out. &#160;I was not disappointed! &#160;We started with the black cod and yellow tail collar. &#160;The cod was very sweet and moist with a great miso flavor. &#160;The yellowtail collar was reportedly freshly brought in from Portland and was just amazing! &#160;The skin part was crispy and that meat on the bone flavor of yellowfin tuna is intoxicating! &#160;We ordered the omakase sushi platter which included scallops/eel/salmon/chutoro/smelt/mackrel/sea urchin and yellowtail. &#160;Amazing! &#160;I have never had smelt sushi and have never been the biggest fan of the mackel sushi but here they snuck in a bit of ginger between the rice and fish so the slightly bitter fishy flavor that you can get with these fish was totally absent! A very, very nice execution! &#160; We also split a green tea fried ice cream dessert. &#160;We were looking forward to a mochi ball afterwards but only had mango and cappucino flavors. &#160;After that, we were all comfortably numb. &#160; The service was really good and our waiter was very helpful. &#160;It may be a bit pricey for some but hey, its sushi right? &#160;Usually don't go to a nice sushi bar when your sticking too close to a budget. I should have known this place was on point when I first walked in and saw a bowl of matsutake mushrooms resting atop the elevated sushi bar glass... with what seemed like a spotlight pointing on them, giving them something of a glowing aura. I was in town for the Decibel Electronic Music Festival this past September, and lucky for me, I met a local townie who was not only a fellow foodie, but who had a hot tip on the best spot in Seattle for some quality sushi. Shiro's Sushi was by far and away the top spot for authentic, superbly fresh fish in Seattle. Based on a couple other recommendations he had hit out of the park already, I decided to put him to my highest test and try out his tip on sushi. Good thing I did, because in many ways, this was one of the more eye opening sushi meals I had had in awhile. Specifically, it really brought me back to remembering the value in simplicity, the execution of classic style, and how ultra freshness can really allow proto-sushi to shine even without the frills of today's too-busy-for-their-own-good style establishments. Some highlights:- the previously mentioned matsutakes. luckily, my September trip to Shiro's was smack dab in the limited window that is matsutake season. we opted for the grilled appetizer version, and their luxuriousness really did make me wish every week was matsutake season. - geoduck clam (pronounced "gooey duck") - DELICIOUS. we opted for the for the geoduck sauteed in butter based on our waiter's recommendation, and it was so FUCKING good, that we had a second order for dessert. - tai nigiri aka snapper. i'm going to go on the record and say that Shiro's Sushi had the *best* tai i've ever experienced. here's why: snapper, while i usually dig on it, isn't the nigiri that steals the show. it's usually refreshing and light, but usually takes the back seat to other, stronger flavors of the meal. not here though. this had to be fresh, right off the boat, because the meat was just... dense with flavor. almost like somewhere between a jack fish and something like white tuna or escolar. to me, it's easy for a sushi place's toro to be the highlight of the meal. it is *extremely* difficult to have your tai be the ultimate highlight though, and that's a big way Shiro's really rocked my world.- other nights: great, and just diverse enough selection of sake. also, a intriguing nasu dengaku (broiled eggplant w/ sweet miso), and a fresh fresh piece of awabi nigiri (abalone!)- also worth mentioning here that the service was exceptional. taking the time to talk about some questions we had about the menu (we likely wouldn't have ordered the geoduck if it wasn't for our server's amazing description), making recommendations, and all around making us feel welcome and taken care of.on the walk through belltown to get to the restaurant, we passed other, more modern looking japanese restaurants we likely would have chosen over Shiro's just based on aesthetics. you get to Shiro's, and it's a pretty humble and more traditional looking place. but based on the recommendation of a local foodie, i luckily knew there had to be more to the picture, and now i can't wait to get back to Seattle to have another go. An excellent sushi place hands down. &#160;Very fresh fish, awesome chefs, great (and hilarious!) wait staff, the whole experience was friendly and delicious! &#160;It's also a good sign that the people working here are Japanese, so you aren't going to get any bastardized concoctions and whatever random trendy mayo rolls. &#160;Come here if you want yourself some pure, fresh fish. So we brought some out of town guest's from Chicago to Shiro's after hearing good review's (YELP!) and I must say their sushi was very fresh and delightful. The presentation was excellent and service was quite helpful. We had ordered the sea urchin that was served in it's original shell, various rolls, chef's recommended sushi platters, oyster's, and sake from Hokkaido. We were quite pleased with the overall experience. If you're in the Belltown area, I would suggest dining here! Price is a little high amd would suggest reservations since their restaurant is quite small. one of the things i miss most about living in seattle is the abundance of fresh sushi. &#160;but i especially miss being able to walk down three blocks to my favorite sushi place, shiro's. &#160;mr. shiro is sort of a seattle icon. &#160;he's been around for years- even after his articles and recipes ran in the new york times back in the 90s, he still managed to keep his standards high. &#160;they have a good list of japanese drinking and cooked foods as well as sushi. &#160;don't expect to find too many americanized rolls, though. &#160;but instead, eat what is good here- unbelievably fresh sushi and sashimi. &#160;ask the server (or sushi chefs if you are sitting at the sushi bar) what's fresh for the night. &#160;toro, uni, geoduck (with a little squeeze of lemon and salt- AMAZING), amaebi, aji- you name it. &#160;you can't go wrong!! &#160;miso cod is buttery and flakey every time. &#160;i also like the ankimo (foie gras of the sea) dish. &#160;order a bottle of otokoyama and enjoy. shiro's is hands-down the best and freshest sushi i've ever had. &#160;not sure how shiro's can get anything other than a 5-star.my gf and i had omakase style sushi approx. $60/each. &#160;we got there 5:30pm and sat in front of shiro - they seemed overstaffed at the time (i.e. place was empty).fish/seafood: FRESHi don't remember every piece we had, but the fish/seafood is the freshest i've had ever (aside from buying your own daily catch at a market)... example: our ebi nigiri and deep fried prawn head was made from a live prawn that shiro showed off before he cut it into pieces.rice: perfectly done w/ just enough wasabi (no need to add soy/wasabi)black cod appetizer: i didn't care too much for this dish, but my gf said it was one of the best fishes she atedrinks: overpriced, even for belltownservice: i thought the service was great - probably because they weren't really busy at the time... but i really enjoyed chatting with shiro as he prepared our foodthe one bad thing is that i can no longer be fully satisfied with any of the "cheaper" sushi joints... don't get me wrong, i don't mind going to umi, wasabi bistro, or sushi zen for a quick sushi fix - maybe even musashis... &#160;but if i really want to enjoy sushi and order nigiri/sashimi without adding extra soy/wasabi - i must go to shiro's. This past summer, i was lucky enough to spend a couple weeks in Japan gorging myself on some of the most amazing food i've ever eaten. When i returned to the US. i was afraid i would never be able to eat sushi again because everything would pale in comparison to fish from Tsukiji market. And then I found Shiros. The restaurant decor is very simple but the food is incredible! Every piece of fish is perfectly cut and so fresh. And the rice, well, i think it's the best &#160;rice i've had in Seattle. I need to go back and try more dishes, but all in all, it was delicious. Came here with a co-worker who raved about this place. &#160;We sat at the sushi bar and had the honor of being served by Shiro himself. &#160;He took us on a sushi adventure I had never experienced as an amateur who usually sticks to rolls. &#160;The sushi and nigiri that we experienced that night changed me forever -- I can't stop thinking about it! &#160;The rice in the nigiri was already perfectly seasoned with wasabi, no worries about overpowering or underwhelming with the wasabi. &#160;I wish this was more common. &#160;This place is one of the best, make a stop here if you can. FIRST rate sushi and sashimi. Not the most fantastically creative place in the world, but they pick great fish, and they embellish cautiously yet effectively. Their albacore tuna was particularly good, and the vinegar accompaniment was a very good touch. &#160;The ambience is basic Japanese Sushi-decor, but I have no issue with that as it only makes clear that I am paying for the fish, not the wallpaper or artwork.
I like this place because I know I will always get a good meal here. &#160;I'm rather picky about sushi, so I don't want to waste my time with somewhere that is mediocre. &#160;During matsutake season, they'll fix matsutake dobinmushi (matsutake steamed in a teapot). While I prefer Kisaku, Shiro's really leaves little to desire. &#160;I was quite pleased with my sushi. &#160;Next time I'll try to the omakase. &#160;Make reservations on Fridays and Saturdays (as one would expect) but be sure that they don't seat you in the back - while a bit more private, it also feel sterile and detached from any charm the main restaraunt has. Shiro's is my favorite place in Seattle overall for my crack, I mean sushi habit. Sure it's a bit on the spendy side compared to Musashi's or *shudder* Sushiland, but when you compare it to the top places in Los Angeles, New York and Japan, it's quite a steal. Shiro-san is adorable even when he jokingly comments on my revolving door of dates I drag here. Consistently high quality fish, good sake list, fun and friendly crowd... what's not to love?Hey wait a minute... I think Shiro-san called me a ho!? Amazing sushi, but definitely not on the cheap side. More of a twice-a-year special place.
Friendly staff, food is in front of you before you know it, very charming decor and excellent prices. The food comes in large quantities and the quality is superb. You can easily get out of here for under $20 for two people without drinks. Highly recommended This place has plenty of seating, kiiinda okay service, and mid grade thai food. The reason I say mid grade is because whatever I order it always seems to be lacking some sort of taste. They have a good lunch menu with fairly cheap prices. Not deserving of 4.5 stars! They don't even serve with chopsticks. &#160;I've had Pud Thai at many restaurants, and the taste (the bitterness of the tamarind) just wasn't there. &#160;The hot and sour soup was thin, bitter, and overpowered by lemon grass. &#160;The interior was dark and the decor minimal. &#160;On the positive side, service was friendly and attentive and efficient. I would rather go to Thai Tom's any day, in the U district. Ever since Lake City's Thai One On got their fourth strike (I was generous), we have been desperately seeking a Thai food place that delivers. And Chaiyo does just that. First time eating here tonight, and I'm full and happy. We ordered the BBQ chicken, Pineapple Curry, and the yellow curry with beef. I think they might have mixed up the stars, but it was some good food. The rice was a little dry, but it's a longish drive, so no hard feelings. :D We will be ordering our curry from our new friends at Chaiyo from now on. Only neg: I hate canned pineapple! Have tried several dishes here now and have never been let down. The coriander beef is DIVINE! I am slowly working my way through all of their "specials". I LOVE .. LOVE.. this place .. their seafood fried rice can never go wrong !! they have good curry too .. the only con is every time I got there they always busy and we always have to wait for table but their food and service are awesome. A good, cozy place with a warm atmosphere.Food are good. The seafood fried rice are good (the taste can vary a little bt, sometimes too sweet or spicy... I guess it depends on who cooks it that day)Their fish dishes are good, basil beef, swimming rammaOverall a good place for thai food Even with the choice and selection Chaiyo has, nothing would tell me more about them than their Pad Thai. So that's what I ordered on this first visit there.I didn't realize how much I liked crunchy bean sprouts until I tried it here. Unlike other Thai places, their noodle dishes come with many of the ingredients separated (noodles, meat, shredded carrots, peanuts, and bean sprouts). This comes especially in handy for picky eaters and, to some degree, people with food allergies. But I also enjoyed getting to control how much went into each bite, and played around with proportions until I found something I liked.The food was fantastic, and my friend's Pad Kee Mao was also delicious. We ordered Crispy Fried Wontons as an appetizer and could've probably done without it: too much crispy and not enough wonton/meat, in my opinion.We were well-served by two waitresses, being the only customers there until we were almost finished. Planning to go back there and try some of their other dishes. I have only eaten here once. &#160;I came with my wife after running some errands in around Northgate and we decided to see Ironman 2, so we had 45 minutes to grab a bite.We quickly checked out Yelp on our iphones and Chaiyo came up pretty quick, as was well located in terms of Northgate shopping and movie. &#160;They served up Stash hot tea really quick . &#160;Food also came pretty quick. &#160;We had the peanut sauce based curry with chicken, 2 star level in spicy-ness, but will do 3 next time (last curry listed on menu) and another chicken dish with wide rice noodles and lots of veggies. &#160;2 star level in spicy-ness also. &#160;This was perfect for this style of dish. &#160;No need to go hotter.The inside of the restaurant is appropriately decorated and comfortable, and roomy--I'm surprised that there was so much open space. &#160;Typically, restaurants pack in tables. &#160;Perhaps they don't get enough customer volume to need this. &#160;There is outdoor seating as well. &#160;Service is really good, they check on you frequently, but not enough to annoy you.2 dishes. Brown rice on the side. &#160;Hot tea for 1. &#160;Total was about $23. &#160;Which I thought was really good overall.Anyways, the whole experience was very pleasant. &#160;The food was quick, hot, and tasty. &#160;45 min in total, just enough time to get to the movies. &#160;We will come back for sure, probably next time we go see a movie.Cheers!!! Living so close to here, Chaiyo is my go-to Thai place for when I need takeout at 8:55 pm on a Tuesday. Luckily for me, the waitstaff is always polite and never look annoyed when I walk in just a few minutes before closing. When eating here, food comes out pretty quickly, everything is reasonably priced, and substitutions are easy to make. The flavors are clear and sometimes sinus-clearing, but the only problem I've encountered is that the dishes are often slightly too salty. The saltiness is easily cut with rice, but eating entrees straight has me reaching for the water glass (which is attentively refilled) almost constantly. Next time I'll ask for less salt...hmm... Nonetheless, I'll keep coming here for quick Thai fixes [I'm partial to the pineapple fried rice minus the pork], and in that respect, they never disappoint. Chaiyo Thai was really good!! I've been craving Thai food for the longest time and this really hit the spot. First off, I went with my family.. My sister and I are whimps when it comes to spicy food so we didn't get anything crazy. They brought out sweet and soup as a starter- which was surprisingly good but a bit spicy. I love peanut everything, so we ordered "swimming angel" haha... which was chicken on top of spinach with peanut sauce + rice, chicken pud thai noodles, chicken curry, and garlic chicken. Everything was very good. I was a happy girl. Portions are large, and this place is great for sharing. I really liked our waiter, he was always refilling drinks and was really friendly. I wish there were more Thai places like this SoCal! We will visit Chaiyo Thai again if we find ourselves in Seattle again! (I would go back tomorrow if I could) Chaiyo Thai is definitely just about as good as it gets. The service was fantastic, the atmosphere was cute and they even have an outdoor patio to sit in. We ordered spring rolls to start which were a great vegetarian option but I prefer fresh rolls rather than fried and they didn't have that option. It was a very generous portion for only $4. For a main dish I ordered the Gaeng Keow Wan. Thai green curry is always my favorite and it's hard for me to venture too far away from it. This was only lacking more veggies (only bamboo shoots and chicken) but the flavor was as good as the curry I ate in Thailand! &#160;They also offer brown rice which makes me so happy! The portions are enormous! I got 3 meals out of my curry. Go here! You will not be disappointed. I went to lunch with two friends that were craving Thai food. I looked on Yelp for a Thai restaurant that was close by. It is a very nice place to eat, lots of decorations, and the service was good. We ordered the fried tofu for the the appetizer, and it was good. &#160;The sauce was really nice. My friends ordered the spicy noodle (the mushrooms really made that meal) &amp; phad thai (really good noodles). I ordered the panang curry. It was my first time trying it, and I really enjoyed it =). We were all full, and took home the left overs. I think this is my new favorite Thai place, I really enjoyed the curry! The only downside was that the rice wasnt a part of the meal so it's an additional $1.
Living in the neighborhood, I've noticed that this place seems to be very popular. Now that I've dined here I'm left scratching my head, wondering why.Service: indifferent and glacial (Because I'm not a regular, I guess.). Place was only 1/2 full when we arrived.Food: So-so, certainly nothing to rave about.The one positive from the whole evening was the Tiramisu that we got to go because it took so long to get our meal.Next time I'll eat some place else and pick-up a piece of Tiramisu on the way home. I went to Santorini's for the 1st time on Valentine's day, thinking it's a small place it won't be as crowded as some of the chain restaurants in the area. Well, I was wrong, there was a line up at the door. On the upside, the owner was giving away complimentary glasses of wine or bottles of beer while waiting for a table! WOW!! I was very impressed with that!! I mean really, when does that ever happen?!! I had the Chicken Tortellini (talk about cheesy goodness!), my husband had Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo. You also get salad and all garlic bread you can eat! Everything &#160;was delicious! My family that lives down in Tenino (south of Olympia) came up one night, and for dinner my husband and I took them &#160;there. They were all impressed. My grandma keeps mentioning coming back to Seattle to eat at Santorini's. She is a pasta connoisseur!! Food is delicious!! YUM!
This place is huge!! The menu is also huge!! They have alot of things that many other restaurants do not have, like pea vines!!It is Vietnamese/Chinese and is very good. Parking is also ample. Service can be a little slow, probably due to the size of the place, but it is well worth a try.
I'm a big fan of this place. While it's small and I generally wait a little longer than I normally do at other places, the food is excellent. I've tried at least 5 entrees from the menu and liked all of them which is rare for me.If you look below the counter at the register they have some award for a higher standard of healthiness to the food. I think it has something to do with the salt or fat content because it doesn't taste as salty or greasy as most Chinese cuisine.If you like lemongrass chicken, this place has the best I've ever had. This place has beckoned from a distance a number of times over the past couple years as I passed on the Burke-Gilman Trail. &#160;The conspicuous display of Chinese orthography made its usual mysterious promises about sweet sauces, tender meats and exotic vegetables prepared in exotic ways that in this case the Yummy Cafe couldn't keep.First of all, getting into the place was treacherous. &#160;The wheelchair ramp seems like a perfunctory afterthought. &#160;It lets out right next to some landscaping that I would surely fall into if my tire slipped. &#160;This is a lawsuit waiting to happen not only for Yummy Cafe but perhaps for the neighboring fire station as well.Right out of the gate the tea was excellent. &#160;Among subtle flavors I think I could discern hints of lavender and jasmine. &#160;It had just the right level of bitter. &#160;The food was pretty bland, however. &#160;We had the Dinner for Two which came with orange beef and General Tso's chicken. &#160;The beef itself was sub par, the orange sauce was too sweet and not enough orange. &#160;The chicken was dry and flavorless and the sauce didn't taste anything like what I was used to. &#160;My friend says the bathroom was cleanI give this place two stars because of the very gracious and accommodating staff and because I am curious enough to come back and try some other items. Wow, I am just seeing what is reviewed around my neighborhood and I just reviewed Snappy Dragon, this is my other favorite place to get Chinese Food.This is a little different than Snappy Dragon, more traditional American Chinese Food. &#160;You get everything that Snappy Dragon does not serve.Egg Foo Young, and all your favorite dishes. &#160;The prices are great, a little cheaper than Snappy, and when I don't feel like the dishes that Snappy serves, then I go here and I was happy to see it reviewed.So, now you have my two favorite Chinese Restaurants. &#160;Enjoy! I usually have such a difficult time digesting Chinese food, however, the food here was different. It was edible and it was good. I'm glad I discovered it because I had been looking for a place that served 1. Americanizedish chinese food and 2. didn't make me feel sick. It also wasn't too spendy either. This is the perfect neighborhood Chinese food place. Yummy Cafe is a wonderful family owned affordable Chinese Restaurant that is always great to turn to when we have little time to prepare a meal. &#160;The owners are very friendly and always welcome their clients. &#160;We either eat at the restaurant and often order in when we have less time. &#160;When we order in, our food is often delivered within 20 minutes or less. &#160;My wife and I like everything we have ordered from their menu. &#160;Our favorite dishes are their Pot Stickers, Chicken Curry and Mongolian Beef. &#160;If you have not been here, we highly recommend you give it &#160;try. &#160;For anyone with young children who live in the area, this is a restaurant you want to have on speed dial! Yummy Cafe has been across the street from Met Market when Met Market used to be Albertsons. That was quite awhile ago. A total neighborhood joint that does a strong take out business and a much faster (and a little cheaper) than the nearby Pearl place on 35th and 75th. Yes, it's Americanized Chinese. But the food is always fresh, prepared quickly (even when it's busy), and an entree can be easily split between two people for a lighter dinner. My favorite(s) are the potstickers and an order of the mongolian beef- it's not as sweet as other American Chinese places I've been to. Haven't gotten take out in some years, but I remember it coming within 40 minutes of having placed the order when we did get it. Had the chicken garlic and broccoli beef with brown rice. The item with the most flavor was the brown rice. I think they boiled all the ingredients together, and put a few drops brown food coloring in. I would give them 3 stars if the food was too salty! If you closed your eyes and took a bite, you can only identify the meat by the fact it was chewier than the veggies. They did deliver it pretty fast, but the food was pretty terrible. 5best chinese that i've had in seattlefreshdelicious vegetablesgreat servicegreat chinese yay! Great little Chinese place. &#160;Nothing too fancy, but if you're looking for reasonably priced tasty Americanized Chinese food, this is the place to go.My wife and I ordered the dinner for two and we substituted the string bean chicken in. &#160;It's not on the menu, but we wanted a very flavorful chicken dish and they decided to make something off-menu for us. &#160;Sweet and sour soup was great, egg rolls were good, but the BBQ pork was very disappointing. &#160;That is the only reason they get 4/5 stars. &#160;It was basically little pieces of pork chop served with ketchup, mustard and sesame seeds.For entrees we got the string bean chicken and the orange beef. &#160;Both were delicious and very flavorful. &#160;And to top it off, even the fortune cookies tasted above average. &#160;We'll definitely be coming back here at least for take-out and delivery. I live down the street from this little restaurant. &#160;The people who work here are super friendly every time I come in for my take out order. &#160;Definitely not the best Chinese food I've ever had but the location is convenient and the lunch prices are awesome! Service was excellent, staff was very nice. Food was very bland, very blah. Would not visit again. Yum yum. Pretty authentic also. Probably one of the better Chinese place outside of china town. What we had:Steamed riceFamily style bean curdHot and sour soupMu Shu Veggies (I think-was cabbage and carrots with pancakes to wrap it in)Pros: Staff was very friendly and take out only took 10 minutes, good price to portion rationCons: Tofu in Family Bean Curd was bland as were all the veggies, tasted like they had been steamed or microwaved and then sauce poured over then.Overall nothing to write home about. Likely will not try again as none of the dishes really sparked our interest. This was our first visit at Yummy Cafe after searching the web for a "best Chinese Restaurant in Seattle'. &#160;With the exception of the Corn Chowder which was very bland, all of the other entrees were exceptional. &#160;This is a small establishment but the atmosphere was inviting and clean. &#160;A definite place we'd drive from Bellevue again.
I should have suspected something when we arrived without a single patron sitting in the dining area. Maybe a foreshadowing that the food would cause me to spend some quality time atop my porcelain throne later in the evening?Everything tasted fine and dandy - from the spring rolls, to the swimming rama - but I stated the former passage only because both myself and the lady got a bit sick to our stomach afterwards. Maybe the particular dish we ordered just didn't agree with our digestive systems, or maybe God himself was spiting me for cutting of that slow driver on 520 moments earlier.Either way, the atmosphere/d&#233;cor/service/pricing were all fantastic. The food even tasted good, just didn't sit well. Maybe - just maybe - I'll be back to try something else and shine a new light on this place.
A great cool somewhat new addition to the West Seattle scene. &#160;I finally made it to the Skylark the other night for a drink and a bite to eat. &#160;The place is adorable inside, so cute, or should I say tough so the boys will still want to go check it out. &#160;They have tots I don't think I need to say anything else, oh they have tots with cheese too! &#160;What's not to like about a place that has tots with cheese? &#160;We started with the tots with cheese and than I had to try their mac n cheese. &#160;First off if you don't like crushed black pepper do not order the mac n cheese it's covered in the stuff. &#160;The mac n cheese was good but it was a little too creamy for me. &#160;I tend to like my mac n cheese to be a little thicker but it was baked and there was crispy cheese on top which was a nice crunchy extra that I loved. &#160;The bread that came with the mac n cheese was OMG to die for, it was a slice of their grilled rustic bread and I wanted more and more but I stuck to the piece I was given I didn't want to OD on carbs that night.The service was excellent, the bathrooms were clean, the place was great. &#160;They have live music with no cover Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, they have karaoke Tuesday night, and open mic night on Wednesdays. &#160;They also have brunch Saturday and Sundays and I plan on checking it out one weekend soon.*Update*Finally tried the brunch and went with the Dungeness Crab Cake Benedict it was good, the crab cakes were HUGE much bigger than I ever expected and were probably 75% crab and 25% filling so a pretty good ratio if you ask me. &#160;The eggs were how should I say it, over cooked, it was like hard boiled eggs sitting on top, not a bad thing but not really a good thing either. &#160;The hollandaise was good but scarce had to ask for some extra. &#160;The home fries on the other hand were wonderful. &#160;I'll be back for brunch again maybe to try the biscuits and gravy next time. ****UPDATE 3/29/2008: They lose a star for being completely inattentive and not offering us water at all for brunch/breakfast. Also, some of the servers can be kind of surly. We went here 2 weekends in a row for food and the service was pretty disappointing.****END UPDATE**** Um, yes. Go here.I had read about it on yelp and then my adorable physical therapist mentioned he had participated in the last Open Mic festivities, which translates to "giiiiiirrrrrl, you betta check this joint out".I convinced one o' my best girls to try something new and we were both super happy with our decision.It was Open Mic night tonight and as myself and the two ladies accompanying observed - "this is surprisingly good". Seriously, the performers don't suck - yeesssss!The tater tots with cheese? Delicious. Hummus plate? Can't go wrong.The crowd was diverse but not in the hipster to yuppie range you can get at a lot of the places we tend to frequent. Pretty much the 20 something to 30 something crowd ranging from "normal" to "cooler than normal".I was complimented on my hat and my shoes AND was informed in a roundabout way that I look younger than I actually am. It's like yelp but in 3D real life!The servers are friendly, it's a decently sized place and there is free music pretty much all the time that doesn't suck (they even played Scissor Sisters "Filthy Gorgeous" - one billion happy points from this girl).Just so you know - parking can get a bit difficult in their lot after 8 or 9, but it's nothing like parking in downtown West Seattle or on the Hill. Rejoice and make yo'self a regular! Two words: Weekend Brunch.It runs from 9:30 - 3 Saturday and Sunday and it's not unusual to see me there both days. &#160;I've looked around West Seattle and have yet to find anything that even comes close to the Skylark brunch experience.The food is absolutely awesome, they've got something for everyone. &#160;I usually get the eggs benedict or, if I had an exceptionally rowdy evening the night before and am not ready for solid food, I go with a cup of their tomato basil and a truly inspired grilled cheese. &#160;The cooks here clearly enjoy their jobs and are always coming up with really interesting specials ... Last weekend I had the flapjacks with orange-butter syrup, which rocked.Ahhhh yes, and then there's the alcohol. &#160;Mimosas are a favorite and are made with a splash of pomegranate juice. &#160;yum. &#160;Bloody maries are made with muddled olives, you seriously have to try them to believe how good they are.Service is always excellent, even when the place is packed (and it does fill up).I really just can't say enough good things about Skylark. &#160;If you haven't been down there you owe it to yourself to go check out their weekend brunch. It's a shame that &#160;I'm of &#160;that age where I don't go to a West Seattle haunt for it's live music, Karaoke Tuesdays or the scene, anymore. I go to Skylark for the Steak Salad.Yes, that guy at the west end of the bar closest to the restroom, eating the steak salad, wearing the only italian made suit jacket in the room, while the next &#160;Big Thing is playing their hearts out, on a fantastic little stage. Be sure to say hello. I will certainly put the fork down and engage in conversation. Then, it will be back to my Steak Salad.Good for groups? of course. At my age I know these things. I may even pick up your tab after we chat, and I will finish my Steak Salad. The Skylark is one of those few places that has it all...great music, great food, great service and great cocktails. Let's start with the music. Seems every time I've been to the Skylark, it's a new experience. Lastnight, it was four (or five) dudes, dressed all in black, sporting wide-brimmed cowboy hats, with a sound like none other than...you guessed it...Johnny Cash. Following them, was a Green Day-esque sounding band, with two guys and two girls (very loud, but very good). Breakfast here is the bomb. The eggs benedict is my fave, with fresh-made hollandaise sauce and a side of fruit (or potatoes if you prefer).If you're in the mood for a cocktail, I highly recommend the Pom Pom. It's essentially a cosmo, but instead of cranberry, it's made with pomegranite juice and pomegranite infused vodka. Yum!The Skylark is a great little neighborhood bar that West Seattle was in desperate need of...happy one year anniversary Skylark! Hope there are many more to come! Holy Fuck'n Shit! &#160;I love this bar. &#160;We stopped by for the food and keep going back for the attitude :-) &#160;The owner / manager/ resident smart ass will have you laughing till you pee your pants as soon as you walk through the door. &#160;Everyone here is "honey" or "babe" because no-one knows your name and no-one really cares. &#160;Just order something fabulous to eat and chase it with a stiff one... a drink or the owner, which ever you prefer. &#160;My favorite is the steak salad with a Blue Berry Stoli and club soda with a lime.Seriously, you must try this place at east once. I bused out to the Skylark last night to see Murder Party play. It was much easier than I had expected to get here by bus, as the 11 that goes across capital hill from my house becomes the 125 that goes right by the skylark. Either the first or second stop as soon as the 125 gets off the west seattle bridge put you within walking distance of the place. The bus comes back until 11:30pm or so, making it a great place for dinner and starting a night of drinking, then working your way back home by way of other favorite bars.At first it seemed a little small for where it was. Venues like the Twilight are about the same size and I would have expected something bigger "so far" out of the city. It turned out nice though, the high ceilings definitely make it feel bigger than it was.The live music was great and the bands played right in front of you in the bar, unlike some venues like Jules Mae that put the bands in another room in the back. It wasn't crowded like a capital hill venue like the Comet always are. We showed up early, probably around 7 and ordered food. We sat ourselves and a waitress found us on her own. The hummus appetizer place was great and I had "The Super Fresh Vegan" sandwich which was awesome. If you're down with the cheese they have a grilled cheese sandwich and appetizers such as "mozzarella logs" which sound wonderful. Check out the online menu for other wonders like the "Ghetto Platter".All over an Awesome venue, just a bit far away for me to go to regularly. Tater Tots!!! &#160;Yes!! &#160;That's all you really want or need in life, right? &#160; Oh, you want &#160;other tasty apps and entrees, a great beer and cocktails menu, AND kickass weekend brunch featuring some of the best french toast in seattle? &#160;Well Skylark has all of those things too! &#160;Horray! &#160;But it gets better! &#160;Skylark works hard for the money and doubles as a great music venue in the evenings. If you have a band that doesn't suck, you and said band should play Skylark. &#160;SO worth crossing the bridge. Ok- So I have been to the Skylark about a dozen times now and I have yet to be disappointed. &#160;That's the thing about this place-- it doesn't pretend to be anything it's not. Matthew- One of the brains behind the whole "Skylark" concept, manager, and resident watchdog rules the school with his relentlessly witty dialog {often shouting from his throne at the bar or from across the room}. With a hip little menu featuring pin-up girls and vespas and a bar featuring sheet metal and back lighting, the Skylark can brag of an atmosphere that successfully walks a delicate balance between industrial rock club, greasy spoon cafe, hole in the wall bar and trendy seattlite hot spot. Stay and eat and you can't get help but get sucked into the dis-functional Skylark family-- Come for music and bring earplugs {or buy them for $.50}-- We hear they have the best Karaoke in town and I definitely can't say enough about the "everything muddled but still under $9" drinks. A+ for originality, A+ for bringing something different to the club/bar/food scene A + for being able to get away with telling your customers to fuck off A+ for pulling off a menu with fried cheese logs, tator tots and fried hostess pie a la mode and also mastering a tasty vegan club and wicked fresh steak salad. All I can say, Skylark my love, is that I am so excited I am moving within walking distance of your glory and I will tell EVERYONE I know to come visit!! {Especially for Sunday brunch because there's nothing more fun then your biscuits and gravy + the Matthew &amp; Johnny show} We went to Skylark tonight and I have to rave about the tater tots. &#160;OMG, my diet is ruined. &#160;The happy hour has great prices ($2.50!!) and we had a great time. &#160;We stayed long enough for open mike and had fun. &#160;Will go again. &#160;Happy to find another great place in West Seattle.
Let me get this straight, Vera's: you are with the times enough to realize you can get away with charging nine dollars for a taco salad, but you can't be bothered to get a debit card machine?  Than Bros I'll get cash for, because I see how the low overhead benefits us all. But for you? I think not.
I've been here several times over the years, each time I had great experience. &#160;First off, I love the name. &#160;The drawing on the menu of a fat squirrel tied to balloons is hilariously cute. &#160;Second, I like that they use fresh/organic ingredients. The pizza is great. &#160;The crust is light and soft, kind of like the indian na'an bread, &#160;and its got a nice crunch to it when you bite down. &#160;This past visit, I had a dungeness crab dip which was really good and the pulled pork pizza with cilantro, which was super unique, never had anything like that before! &#160;Yummy! &#160;The place is spacey, family friendly, have some local beers on tap. &#160;Nice casual joint to unwind on weekends. I have only visited the Seward Park location, but I love this place! It has a great neighborhood feel, ample street parking, good pizza, good beer and wine selection, great staff and interesting artwork for sale in their dining room.They have some fantastic pizzas and will do most of them as 1/2 and 1/2 giving you the opportunity to sample multiple options. &#160;We've worked our way through almost all of their "Pizza Classics" and my favorite has to be Lemon-herb-garlic Roasted Potato with Blue Cheese and Spinach or the Chicken Sausage, Goat Cheese, and Mama Lil' Peppers. &#160;They have delivered consistently exceptional pizzas on every visit no matter what we've ordered.Don't forget to grab a pint of Bluebird ice cream for dessert! A great little neighborhood place with a fair bit of personality. They have a whole lineup of thin-crust pies with a nice selection of toppings that stay outside the conventional, narrow-minded typical choices. The crust tends to the soggy side, unfortunately, which definitely keep a full star off the total. A couple other things knock off half a star, but there's so much they do right that rounding up to four is the right call.You pull up and it's clearly not trying too hard to beat its chest and make itself known--it's stylishly unpretentious and content to cultivate its clientele without grabbing you by the lapel. It's a plain storefront with a bit of sidewalk seating and two dining rooms indoors. There is a series of original local art on the walls, most to do with music.In fact, the pizza names continue the music theme--we had the Booker T, which came, unsurprisingly, topped with green onions. The chicken and cheese and peppers were all good, and it seemed decorous enough to be eating it with a knife and fork. But halfway through the pie, the knife and fork became prerequisites, because the crust was too saggy and droopy to pick up a slice and hold it level anymore. That's the biggest drawback to this place.The ambiance and service are definitely on the plus side. It's a laid-back and informal setting, appropriate for families and groups and dates. They have a few wines and a few decent beers on tap. The service is funny and charming and right on point. The mixed green salad came out with blueberries. Other than that, it was a good standard mixed greens salad, with spinach leaves and other ingredients all fresh and flavorful. Other than the soggy crust, there are just a couple little things working against the place, and not worth knocking it down to three stars. The price seemed a bit high; salad and a pie with a dessert and a couple drinks was nearly $60 before tip. Not outrageous, but worth lifting an eyebrow over. The regular green salad was only $6, too, which is a great deal. Not sure if we ended up with a more-expensive special salad or if the cost came from other things. And the special dessert was way oversweetened. Last night it was the blueberry tartlet. A nice choice for what's in season, and a nice coda to the mixed green salad with blueberries. But goopy and showing way too much white sugar--more like a hostess fruit pie than a scratch dessert. I could do without the little stand under the pizza when it comes out. Just put the pie on the table. You can always set that aside, though, so it's not a demerit.Bottom line, this place is a very good little neighborhood pizzeria with a great sense of itself and some real care being put into what's served. If you can ignore the funny little quirks (maybe order your pie well-done?), then this place is easily worth a visit, probably many visits. I have been wanting to eat here since a friend pointed it out to me almost a year ago. I finally had the chance last weekend. Our server, Ali was super friendly and came by often to check on us. We ordered the Lightenin' Hopkins which came with spicy peppers, mushrooms, cheese, and spicy salami. We all loved it! I prefer a lighter pizza, typically with lots of veggies but I was really in the mood for a little grease and this was the perfect choice. They have tons of options including my favorite toppings; arugula, prosciutto, and Parmesan so not all the choices are heavy.We also ordered a large caesar salad which was plenty for three of us to share. They dress it perfectly here. It's light and fresh with a squeeze of lemon over the top and homemade croutons. We thought about ordering one of the bluebird ice cream floats but we just couldn't find the space in our bellies. Maybe next time.This place is close to home for me so I'll see them again soon! So yummy!!! We had the Rosemary Bean Puree and a couple of pies (can't remember which ones, but they were recommended and VERY tasty!) Such a cute location! Some of the wait staff was kinda dippy, but very nice and everyone is friendly! Great pizza and salad!!! Amazing pizza, great ambience and friendly staff. &#160;They lost the one star because they served me wine in a straight glass. &#160;I asked the bartender and he said that's how wine is drunk in Italy - that was an annoying remark. &#160;The waitress later explained that they ran through $400 worth of stemware and so are serving in regular glasses. this place is the bomb. the pizza here is beautiful. can pizza be beautiful? it really is. i'm happy they added a surfing squirrel pizza for the kids - because it was a little difficult convincing them that this is the best pizza place the ghetto has to offer - well, one of the best places. but, people. the flying irish squirrel?! who ever dreamed up an ice cream float with guiness is pure genius. you MUST try this. but don't try it at home - &#160;fly your little squirrel ass over to this pizza joint! Expensive, but the pizza is delicious. The restaurant part seems nice, although we always hang out around the bar and get our pizza to go. I can see &#160;this being a good place to go on a not super formal but not casual kind of date
Ah, Bush Garden. &#160;A little piece of Japan right here in Seattle, except that the food wasn't nearly as good and the restaurant not nearly as clean as the real thing. &#160;My kobe beef sukiyaki wasn't bad, per se, and it did have the signature slightly sweet flavor, but it wasn't very tender and the dish overall lacked oomph.The tatami mat experience is fun, and the service was good, but the restaurant is shoddy and not an overly appealing place to eat. I had the Kaiseki Bento Box, which includes sashimi, sushi, tempura, salmon (shioyaki, teriyaki or kogane), and chicken teriyaki.The nigiri and sashimi was fine. The chicken was overkill for a bento box. Too much food. I mostly wished I had ordered a different meal. The restaurant itself seemed old and dirty, but not in a quaint way. It is a really nice big space, just needs to be spruced up a bit. The restaurant does not live up to Seattle standards for Japanese restaurants. I've never had Japanese food in Japan so I'm not able to say what was wrong in the food I ordered, but I've had Japanese food in other good restaurants in Seattle, to say that this food was not as delicious as in the other places. Actually especially the sushi wasn't good at all! For sure the fish had the wrong color and texture, and moreover a bad taste, a lot 'fishy'. I want to say that the service was really accurate and nice, and I really loved my first experience in a tatami room, even if there was a hole under the table... do they cheat also in Japan? I haven't ever eaten the food here, so my review is exclusively about the karaoke experience. I've sung a lot of karaoke in a lot of bars around Seattle, and I love the atmosphere at Bush Garden, but the way they run the show leaves something to be desired. There is a very limited selection of songs and they aren't organized very well in the book (rather than just one list of songs, the book is divided into several unrelated sections, so you have to flip through all of them to be sure your song is or isn't available). But even more annoying than that is the fact that the karaoke host is a total mic hog. In the few hours I was there the other night, he sung about 6-8 songs himself. Most hosts will sing 2 or 3 songs, and that's great - you want them to be having fun, too. But, dude, 6 songs? Too many. Let the paying patrons sing. Went to this joint for karaoke and had a decent time. &#160;The song selection is very limited and old so if you only sing old school, you are out of luck here. &#160;Drinks are a plenty.Never tried their food so I can't comment on that.
5-stars for this Korean\Japanese sushi hot-spot on Aurora and Denny and probably Dexter and Westlake and some other important streets...If Tony is woking, just let him choose for you. &#160;He is very talented and I've always been really impressed by everything he's put in front of me. I first ate at Shill in 1994 and the place looked outdated then. &#160;After going back there a few times recently, I can't say that the decor has been updated in any perceivable way, but some places stand the test of time by doing some things well. &#160;In this case, Shilla has had a near monopoly on "fine" Korean dining in downtown Seattle for decades by the basics and classics and then some. &#160;Let's get one thing straight - this is not the best Korean food in the Seattle, but the location is convenient when you don't want to drag your ass down to Federal Way/Tacoma or up to Lynnwood (plus they have plenty of free parking under the restaurant). &#160;Recently, I tried a number of their soups and casseroles and found the dwaengang (Korean miso), soondooboo (tofu) and al (fish eggs) to be decent renditions. &#160;Not so good were the naengmyun (cold noodles) and the dukmandoo guk (rice cake with dumplings), which tasted store bought. &#160;There is also a grill at each table, but you need to order at least two servings. &#160;The bulgogi was decent, and the grilled pork was a better choice. &#160;They also have an extensive Japanese and sushi menu, but I haven't had a chance to try yet.Overall, being a near monopoly helps, but Shilla also does a decent job on a lot of dishes - not great, but not terrible either. &#160;And I predict they will serve up another decade of Korean food in their timeless dining room, unless Paul Allen buys them out. I've never had their Japanese food, so this review is based on their Korean menu.Good authentic Korean food is hard to find in Seattle, so let's not kid ourselves here. &#160;Who cares about authenticity? It's about the taste. Low expectations is the name of the game for Seattle Korean restaurants. That said, Shilla's Korean menu still manages to disappoint. My friend and I went there for lunch on a weekday. The place was basically empty. I should've seen the warning sign! I ordered kimchi jjiggae (kimchi stew) and my friend ordered bulgogi (bbq beef). The food arrived with an assortment of side dishes. We're not experts on Korean food by any stretch of the imagination, but I've had enough good Korean food to know what it SHOULD taste like. Overall, the dishes we ordered were BLAND. The kimchi jjiggae lacked that usual punch. It was also prepared differently than what I'm used to. The side dishes were disastrously Americanised. My friend and I left that place saying "never again". I'm further convinced that great Korean food in Seattle is a pipe dream. Maybe next time, we'll try the Japanese menu.
High-class IHOP with a full bar.'Nuff said. This place is an option for an X-mas dinner if you are young and family-less like we were last X-mas. So we went just to say we did and because it sounded like the strangest thing we could do on X-mas. So the food was below par, freaking way way too much money, and the decor had a strange smoking lounge men's club kind of feel. But to be honest we didn't care one bit. It turned out to just a place for us to go and stare into each other eye's in the dim lighting, pretend we were Dr.Evil in the bar chairs, and spend our money for no good reason on X-mas like good consumers should.We had a blast that night but let me warn you in the same breath- the food is not worth your money on any normal day. Go because it is one of the only places open not because you want to eat good food. Coming home from work late one night I stopped in for dinner since nothing else was open. &#160;The exterior and signage makes the place look like a cheap Denny's, the interior is tacky 70s. &#160;The burger would have been fine were it served at a Steak n' Shake, the fries and tasted like a baked potato and were cut waaay too thick. &#160;If I'm going to pay $15 for a burger I'd rather go the Metropolitan Grill and get Kobe Beef. I too had not been here for quite a few years and coming back was a disappointment. I just seem to have this knack for always liking what restaurants are planning to take off the menu. Why did they have to discontinue the Italian Chicken salad?? Granted $18 for a salad is pricey but ALL their stuff is pricey. Please bring it back 13 Coins, or if not, send me the recipe... Yes the food is average and the pricing is way too high, but I use to love to sit in those high booths and smoke cigarettes and drink coffee for hours. You can't deny the importance of the 24 restaurant. Seattle has a sad late night scene. But 13 coins is ok. I have never got sick or found hair in my food. I will never go to a restaurant that does either of those to me. I really think it would be good as a TV show like Cheers. I've been going to "the coins" since I was about ten years old and though there has been a significant decline in food quality; you can still get what you're looking for: good food in a fun and faux classy atmosphere at 2:00 am. &#160;And the crab eggs Benedict is hard to beat after a night of boozing. I haven't been here in years! Sadly, I should have left my memories of this place where they were. Darn, now the rose-colored glasses have been ripped off and I'm really sad about it. &#160;Open 24hours and free antipasto plate was a really good thing back in college when you were broke and up all night. &#160;However, it is what is - a seattle institution. 13 Coins is a place to experience once in your life. &#160;Then you can cross it off your list and move on.The place is creepy--everything seems grimy, sticky, and dark. &#160;The weird high-backed barstools at the counter and the ultra tall walls between the booths make me think that this would be a good place to hatch some great con scheme with a group of like-minded grifters. &#160;A scheme that would ultimately fail.The food is too expensive, too blah. Everything here--from the decor to the waitstaff to the menu--seems dated and stale. &#160;I've only ever been to 13 coins at night and I'd be fearful of seeing what this place would look like in full daylight. &#160;Some things are best kept in an obscuring, dank, amber glow. &#160;When you finally stumble out of this place, you'll want to go home and shower immediately--all the oil and ick in the place saturates your pores, your clothes and your hair. &#160;Thinking about it makes my skin crawl. The hubby and I were feeling hungry around 11:30pm last night and did what any supposed "in-the-know" Seattleite would do and headed to 13 Coins. I'd heard good reviews so I was intrigued.13 Coins is located in a rather odd, almost industrial part of Seattle. It's not the easiest place to find. The outside of the establishment looks like a late 60's stuccoed office building. Not terribly appealing. The inside reminded me of the steakhouse my grandparent's owned in San Diego for almost 30 years. All wood paneling and immitation leather. You'd expect to see Sinatra at the bar with his ubiquitous glass of scotch. With a little renovation (new veneer, leather, and flooring) it could really be a great space.One thing I really love is the booths and the setup of the tables. At least in the area I was in, all the tables are tucked off into corners so it's actually quiet enough to hold a converation without having to strain to hear! Unfortuately, this is practically an anomaly in restaurants nowadays.The Menu is extensive. They have a wide selection of steaks (of course!), poultry, and seafoods as well as pasta. It took the hubby and I quite a while to take it all in! Eventually, he settled on a small mixed green salad with bleu cheese and linguine in clam sauce. I ordered the same salad and went for the large 13oz Filet Mignon because my husband wanted half! I prefer my steaks rare, but the hubby likes medium (and, apparently to ruin a fine cut of meat), so we split the difference and agreed on medium rare.The salads were average. The greens were crisp and obviously fresh, but the dressing was incredibly bland and the bleu cheese sprinkled on top was dry and flavorless and it only went downhill from there. After trimming all the gristle and a rather large vein (the thing was nearly the size of a garden hose!) &#160;from my 13oz filet, I now had an 8oz filet that I paid an extra $10.00 for. And it was also cooked medium, much to the hubby's delight. My husband's pasta was overcooked, the clams were like little wads of rubber, and the pepper cream sauce tasted like it came from a can. Now, I really wouldn't have been that disapponted if the bill hadn't come to $77.00, not including the tip!!! I've had better meals at friggin' Claim Jumper!After all the good reviews I was shocked at the lack of quality. As I ate, I considered that I my expectations could've been a bit high, but honestly, I can't see where anyone with functioning tastebuds could call this "good" food. It was "average" at best. And that's being generous.If people think this is good food, what are they eating at home for god's sake??? It was one of our honeymoon night.We decided to go since it was 24 hours and very close to our hotel and moreover we had read a good review about this restaurant on some magazine or something. As far as my husband remembers, it said "one of the top 5 restaurants (it probably meant one of the top 5 24 hour open restaurants) in the United States." &#160;BUT, NO WAY!!!Everything was so disgusting.A Bowl of French onion soup: small, more than half the cup was a huge chunk of plastic-like highly-processed industrial cheese. The rest was overcooked and very salty and had little bit of onion.Spaghetti Bolognese (with meat sauce): the pasta was way &#160;overcooked. The source was watery and tasted like a canned sauce. There was almost no meat. &#160;(I could choose either meat sauce or meat ball so I chose meat sauce but what I got was something in between.)My husband ordered some other pasta as well. But after a couple of bites he refused to eat and we got refund for that pasta.According to him, who is Italian, the pasta was way overcooked and was completely tasteless while the source was way too salty and burnt, and he really couldn't stand the taste and spit it out.I ate my food anyway because the senior waiter was nice and polite and I didn't want to make him feel too bad because what had happened was not his fault and he had to apologize us anyway. But now I kind of regretted that I ate it.MAYBE this restaurant used to be a nice one.But not anymore.I really don't recommend this place even for late at night.The quality is too bad to be called a "restaurant."If you pay the same amount, get a room service from your hotel! We were brought here by a friend after arriving in Seattle late one night for a weekend trip. &#160;We were happy to hear there was a late-night place with a big menu, and we were hungry. &#160;Boy, were we disappointed.Caesar salad: chopped iceberg greens from a bag with too much of some kind of creamy dressing. &#160;Seafood and cheddar melt: some small bits of crab and tiny shrimps swimming in a vast ocean of nuked cheese goo. &#160;Spaghetti carbonara: unidentifiable brown sludge smothering cheapass overcooked pasta, liberally seasoned with Baco-s. &#160;Waiter: obsequious to a severely annoying point, could not shut up, and would not leave us alone. &#160;Shiny brown nose. &#160;Bill: $80, just for two of us.The only good thing about my meal here was the chocolate mousse dessert, and that's hard to fuck up, so no points for that.Eat here if you have no taste buds, want to feel important, or are otherwise out of late-night options. &#160;Seattle, can't you do better than this? 13 Coins should be part of the Myers Briggs test. You can definitely tell volumes about someone based on their reaction to this place.I used to come here with my dad for lunch when I was a kid during the summers when I'd "help him at work". As a kid I just loved being with dad and having a burger and fries there. The other place we went to was the Two Bells. At that time, nearly everyone who came to eat in these places wore ties and looked sharp. Since the 70's the standards for this place have really gone down hill, however the culture of this town has changed even more since J.P. Patches and Stan Borreson ruled the Northwest.Local nostalgia aside, I can help sum this all up for you-- 13 coins is a great place to go to at 1am by yourself (don't bring a date unless they're drunk), and have eggs benedict or something while you wait for the effect of the coffee to kick in. This place isn't overrated. I've never heard anyone say the food in this place is great. It's just a haggard 24/7 joint where you can go sober up after your date has dumped you and/or if you're too lazy to cook for yourself.To make your experience pleasant, pretend you're a mobster with a lot of patience laundering some of your money through the manager. Nod your head up and down and wrinkle your lip and brow like Deniro in Goodfellas, finish your meal, wipe your mouth with the linen napkin, and go on your way to a nice little sleep...with the fishes!!! The 13 Coins was once a great lady, you can tell that it was a total hipster hang out in the '70's. &#160;My G-ma likes to tell me how she used to go there after seeing the Symphony with her boyfriend (her married boyfriend, ah-hem). &#160;A swinging '70's gem it was.Today, it's just a broken down old spinster. &#160;The booths haven't changed, the food has only recently changed A TINY BIT. &#160;But you know, it still has it merits.It's open all night and serves things like Escargot - I have drunkenly eaten a lot of snails here. &#160;They actually give you a little relish tray complete with salami slices, green onion, baby corn, carrots, and pickles when you sit down.They do have some great lunch specials - I believe you can get Corn Beef and Cabbage on Wednesday - and the French Onion Soup, while being a little too salty, is really covered in cheese and satisfies on it's own.The booths are high and private, makes me wonder what sort of thing went down in those back in the day. &#160;Perfect place to pop a quick bump I would think. &#160;Did I say that? &#160;Oops. &#160;So in summation: &#160;totally haggard, but still good for a kick, a decent meal in the middle of the night and some free salami. Not that this place is lacking for negative reviews, but here goes anyway. I went to this place with someone I met at a party on Valentine's Day, on my 3rd night after moving here. Maybe this place is the reason I think of Seattle as having a lot of overpriced crap. Why was my expensive sole with pasta so flavorless? Why was my chocolate mousse dessert so uninspiring? This place is supposed to be an upscale version of Denny's. I think I'll just go to Denny's next time. It's cool that it's open all night long. But it's a very mysterious place. The booths are very strange. me, my cousin and some of her friends were in the back of the place so I felt like I was a VIP. The food looked good. I only had Chocolate mousse which was pretty good. I also had a Shirley Temple better known as a kiddy cocktail.The service was a little on the slow side but otherwise it was a pretty nice place. I told my friends that this seemed like somewhere you'd bring a prostitute. Now it's not like I have experience and KNOW where you should bring a prostitute but this SEEMS like somewhere you'd bring one, if you were into that kind of thing. Perhaps this is too harsh, but this place has a seriously sketchy vibe about that. Oh yeah, the food is sub-par, the bread comes with this weird side dish of pickles that are smothered in salami AND everything is horribly overpriced. :( Did I mention that it was 3 AM and we actually had to WAIT (despite the fact that it looked like a good half the restaraunt was empty). Plus it was freezing- that's a personal pet peeve.
We ended up here because Seven Stars Pepper Szechuan was still closed when we arrived at the plaza. Thank goodness Hue Ky Mi Gia was open! I was initially bummed out that I couldn't have my spicy Szechuan dishes, but the bf and I were both impressed w/ the food, service, and price.We ordered the Won Ton Vegetable Egg Noodle Soup, steamed pot stickers, BBQ Egg Noodle Soup, and Combination Fried Rice - all for $35 before tip. For the qualify of food we got, it was money well spent. The broth was nice - not oily or bland. It had a great sesame oil flavor which really perked up my taste buds in the morning. I thought it was pretty strange that they added green-leaf lettuce (not cabbage) in these soups. You would think that they'd get all limpy and gross, but that wasn't the case at all. The only item which I thought was average was the Fried Rice (although this was one of the least oily FR I have ever tasted!). It wasn't the best, but still good with lots of small chunks of everything. &#160;Hue Ky also has pickled jalapenos which I LOOOOVE. It's crunchy, spicy and has a bit of sweetness which made this dining experience even more delicious!Service is top notch here and the Jasmine tea is very good. I will definitely be back for some more of this goodness! Busy Sunday lunch. I decided to give check them out one day......give me the fish ball dry (?) vermicelli---"We have really good chicken wings"---ok, give me those, too.It was packed there and I wish the door swung outward and not inward; not sure who's design fail that is.This was takeout and upon grubbing at home, the verdict is this:the fried garlic chicken wings are really tasty, but almost through all of them, I get pretty tired of all that breading/fried crust. The fish ball vermicelli dry thingie dish was pretty good, maybe a bit better with added sauce/seasoning to taste. What Seattle's International District (nee Chinatown) is all about. I went here with my wife and 5 year old son on Christmas day, fulfilling Part 2 of the Jewish X-Mas tradition (Part 1 is a movie) and was not disappointed. The fried tofu was perfectly breaded on the outside and the right amount of firmness on the inside (not too much, not watery). The steamed potstickers were slippery and chewy on the outside (not burnt in any way) and as usual the soy-based sauce is just excellent. For entrees we split some combination fried rice, a curried noodle dish with chicken and stir-fried veggies with chicken, shrimp and beef. Everything came out in reasonable time frame and was cooked nicely (not burnt, overly saucy or under-sauced). It's the kind of Chinese food you wish every place in Seattle served, but they don't.My only complaint was that it took a little while to get our check - but that's because the place was mobbed (there was a line before we got there and after we left) and there's not a lot of room for the waiters to move around. They apologized and I'm not really going to hold it against them.I'll close by saying when you're pretty much the only non-Asian person in the restaurant it's a good sign. Every time I visit my dad, I always make him take me here. BEST DUCK WONTON, dried or with soup in town according to my dad. My ratings? cheaps, good, and clean. I tried this place for the first time tonight, and I truly fell in love!I ordered the deep fried chicken wings with onions and garlic, which is a MUST order! The batter was so crispy and the wings were so juicy! I also ordered the bbq pork noodle bowl. The pork was so tender and flavorful.The atmosphere was busy, but I loved the vibe of the restaurant. Everyone is just eating and enjoying good food together.I would not recommend this place for large groups because seating is a little tight.I will definitely be back! Located in Seattle's International District, this place is delicious. I arrived at around 1pm on a weekday and it wasn't particularly busy, but it had a fair amount of customers. The service is kind and the patrons keep to themselves. There are mix of people of different races and ages that come and eat here, so that's pretty cool. I particularly enjoy eating dry egg noodles (Mi Kho) with seafood and pork complimented with a side of soup. I scoop some of the soup, pour it on the noodles to make it easier to separate and gets them moister. The egg noodles were Al Dente. &#160;Flavor was balanced with the right amount of seasonings and very tasty. They topped the dishes with a sufficient amount of shrimp, meat, and veggies. Super filling, affordable, and satisfying. Verdict: 4.7 out of 5.0 Love this place! My go to when I want comfort food.I always order the roasted duck with the soup on the side. &#160;I love the little chicharone bits they have in it. &#160;Maybe not so good for my heart or gut though. &#160;Don't forget to order the butter chicken wings as well.Place is small so if you're going during the 11am - 1pm time it can get crowded and you might have to wait a bit for a table but it's well worth the wait. Admittedly, I was pleasantly surprised by this little restaurant! We came on a weekday for lunch. We managed to get a table but I could tell it can be a busy joint on the weekends. Service was prompt; we were served our food probably 5 minutes after we ordered. We followed some yelp recommendations and went with the braised duck noodle - deliciously moist, tender, and flavorful. Our other dish was the beef rice noodle dish which was my bf's favorite. We are not small eaters but we managed to bring leftovers home with us that day. All in all, friendly service, good food, fair prices, decor could use some work but it's no worse than a typical joint in the ID! My friend and I went here for dinner on a snowy day. The service was fast and friendly. Given the cold weather, my friend and I both opted for noodle soup (aka "wet") but you can also have the noodles dry. My friend went for the BBQ pork noodles whereas I got the braised duck noodles. The noodles were standard egg noodles. The broth was quite flavorful. My duck noodles came with two types of mushrooms and bok choys, which was nice. The braised duck was very soft and the meat would fall off the bone. I tried a piece of &#160;my friend's BBQ pork and it was legit. Although, being from CA, I didn't think the food was out of the ordinary, but it was definitely solid. Like most Chinese places, MSG is used here, and I happen to be somewhat sensitive to MSG. So I would recommend that you don't finish the broth, should you order noodle soup, if you also have a MSG sensitivity. YUM!!!!!! &#160;this place was awesome!!! &#160;had stir fried vermicelli noodles with bbq pork, the pork was mega tasty. &#160;and gravy style wide noodles with tofu and veggies also mega tasty!!! &#160;can't wait to go back! This place is situated in a good location where you can usually find parking without much effort. The restaurant itself is small, but the atmosphere is cozy and comfortable. I love coming here for their chicken wings, fried tofu, and roast duck soup. It's so delicious and always leaves me feeling happy. Nothing beats comfort food like the soup here for me, even though it is a little on the sweet side (but if you dig sweet stuff, all the better).The price is fair, almost on the cheap side for what you get. The best thing about this place (aside from the nice wait staff) are their pickled jalapeno's and their selection of sauces to put into your soup. &#160;Overall a great place to check out if you love noodle soup, and have not done so already This place is known for the duck dish.The egg noodle is not the traditional Canton egg noodle. &#160;This noodle is a little bigger and heavier.The noodles dishes/bowls have a stronger taste but not overpowering.The duck tasted good.This is a good alternative place other than pho or canton won ton noodle.Notes:Parking can be challenging.Short wait for a table Always a pleasure to eat here. Great food. Great service. Great price. My forewarning is the long wait during lunch on weekends. Their braised duck noodle soup is the best in town. Second best is the crispy seafood chow meng in my opinion. You have to try these dishes here or you are missing out on their best food. All their staff are ALWAYS genuinely friendly, helpful and polite to customers. I never experienced nor sensed any rudeness from waitstaff and owner here. They know how to treat customers and cultivate a successful business. They never rush customers to finish food and to get out even when they have a line out the block. This is a good sign which shows they like to built long-term relationship with customers as opposed to making their business too efficient like an assembly line. They do not take their success and popularity for granted. They truly value every customer service encounter. This place will be so successful for many more years to come. I hope they expand out so customers could eat any time without the long wait time. The food is stellar: Chicken Wings - great fried garlic toppings, definitely Vietnamese-American influencedFried tofu - smooth and softWonton soup - better than most clear broth soupsHoney Walnut Prawns - way too much mayo, the candied walnuts are addicting, though burnedYou can get good Chinese-American fare, and probably good Vietnamese style-Chinese food too. &#160;The menu is broad enough to satisfy anyone's preferred Chinese food interpretation. Had the chicken that was written about by everyone. &#160;It was good but I had it to go...better to eat it there. &#160;The chicken dried out by the time I got it home. &#160;The portion size was great. &#160;The place was very crowded! I had to wait for my order outside because the place is small... Love this place. Cheap, delicious, quick take out. The staff is super nice too. The roast chicken with egg noodles is one of my favorites. Also, anything with the stir fried rice noodles is great too. Braised duck egg noodle soup!!! &#160;YUM! &#160;The meat is so tender it falls right off the bones. &#160;Flavor is delicious. &#160;Egg noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. &#160;It is perfect for a cold, rainy day in Seattle...which is pretty much everyday 10 months out of the year. &#160;:) I like their noodles! Most of the dishes are my favorite especially the crispy noodle! I like the noodle soup with BBQ pork slices. Yum! It is cheap, but a little hard to communicate with the servers. Just say the number and how many orders, you are good to go! :D This is what Vietnamese food should taste like! My friend and I usually come every week after work for lunch and it is never disappointing. The workers are very nice and always seem to be happy. If your ever hungry in the international district, this is the place to go. We've been to the one in the Ranch 99 plaza in Renton, so we gave this place a try since I was craving something from the ID. It looks like this one is the original, though to be honest, I think I prefer the one in Renton. BF and I both ordered the braised duck egg noodle soup and the chicken wings. The chicken wings were delicious, but we both agreed that the noodle soup wasn't as good as the one in Renton. This one had shiitake mushrooms and dates (both of which I'm not crazy about), which made the broth taste slightly different. The braised duck was really good, however. I enjoyed our meal and would come here again, but I just prefer the Renton location. Had the braised duck noodles...wet and garlic chicken wings. &#160;I will never eat chicken wings anywhere else! &#160;So crunchy and garlicy!!!! &#160;The duck was amazing--moist and the broth is to die for!!! &#160;Will definitely go again! Best place to eat noodle soup with duck! I like fried tofu and chicken wings.... Hint: If you see a bunch of Asians in an Asian restaurant, 99% is the place has good authentic, Asian food!This place is usually really busy over the weekends, so try going on a weekday for faster seating. I myself grew up in a Chinese/Vietnamese family so I can tell if the food here is authentic. And I can tell yah, it sure is. One of the best noodle soups in Seattle. My personal favorite, which i think is already very &#160;popular, is their duck noodle. The duck itself is so juicy and full of flavor and goes well with the broth. You can either get their noodles in a soup bowl or a dry bowl with soup on the side. One thing you MUST GET here is their fried chicken. Oh my gosh. It is so fluffy, so crunchy and so tasty. &#160;I can seriously eat it everyday. Their fried tofu is pretty good too! The service here is exceptionally good compared to other Chinese/Vietnamese restaurants I have been too. Usually in other restaurants, they don't really come up to you and ask you how you are doing and etc. These people are so nice! Even with their limited English skills, I can tell they try their best to give out the best service. Pricing here is very reasonable. The portion here will definitely make you full. Anyway, a must go to if you are looking for a noodle soup place in Seattle on those cold days. D-licious. Parking here kind of sucks though when it is busy. There's a ton of drivers that seriously don't know how to park and takes forever to park.
First of all, this place is an almost diamond in the rough. The service is stupendous, the food is unique and authentic, and most importantly tastes awesome! I personally am a huge fan of "Pho" (Vietnamese Noodle Soup), and this noodle house has a variety of options. I ordered the M5- Braised Duck Egg Noodle soup style. WOW! There is a whole duck leg in your soup and you can imagine how you are supposed to eat it in the soup. BUT the broth of the soup literally makes the meat fall of the bone. Delicious! You would have to be crazy to order anything else!I added a lot of chili sauce to the soup itself, along with hoysin and sriracha sauce- if you like your asian food spicy...this is the way to go!! Highly recommend this place!! Whenever I drive by this restaurant, it always looks pretty busy.Good noodle soup (The broth is very light yet flavourful without being too sweet/star anise-y), good portion size, and good price! I like the hot sauce in a jar.I wouldn't mind more veggies in my soup though... I like everything about this place.Great food, great prices, and friendly staff. I love the fried tofu and chicken wings. The soups are great, the broth is non-greasy and fresh tasting. Since I have discovered this place, I have been going back weekly! The braised duck soup with egg noodles is the best! I had the braised duck with egg noodle with soup on the side and garlic chicken wings. &#160;The braised duck is to die for, it was tender and moist! -- Yummy! &#160;=) &#160;The egg noodle was super good as well. &#160;The only change I can think of is try to lower the sodium level a bit because it was saltier than I would like, however not bad at all.The garlic was chicken wings were super good as well, nice and crispy with just the right around of garlic. =)This restaurant definitely over best braised duck in ID! &#160;Give them a try, you won't be disappointed! Cheap, Great Food, Great service. yeah I love it here. I go at least Once a week. The Calamari is so good. Just try it. You'll be pleased. They play all Teresa Tang Music, good place to eat and enjoy yourself. Just ate here once, but overall a strong first impression. There are many noodle places around, and many have their own twists... this is Chinese-inspired run by Vietnamese, Samurai Noodle is Japanese ramen, Mike's Noodle House is Chinese, Fulin is Japanese-Chinese ramen, Gourmet Noodle Bowl is Taiwanese... since I love noodles, I liked them all. I was overall happy here, with reasonable prices, relatively easy parking (though I don't recommend the downstairs garage if you can avoid it), and prompt and polite service. Our total bill came to $16 pre-tip. It wasn't a ton of food but portions definitely left us satisfied and not grossly full.I thought I ordered the roast duck noodles, but I'm pretty sure I got the braised one (oops). We also ordered the BBQ pork noodles and a side of Chinese donuts*. We also received a complementary sampler of the fried crab + cream cheese wontons. I'm not sure if this is atypical since they are allegedly coming up on their one year anniversary, but free food is always awesome. Especially fried cream cheese, yum!After I got over the initial disappointment with the meat ("wow how can they call this roast duck? ... oh"), I liked it. BBQ pork wasn't anything special. The main star in my opinion was the broth, different between the two dishes; the broth for the duck tasted strongly of vegetables (celery), which was a nice healthy-seeming contrast from the fatty duck (still salty and a little greasy though).At any rate, definitely worth the $16 + tip for us!* Chinese donuts are deep fried airy dough sticks sliced up. I enjoy eating them with noodles by dipping them in broth lightly and nom-nomming them. Definitely junk food, but yummy. They aren't similar to American donuts otherwise; they're more like churros but without sugar/cinnamon. I love this place enough to try to make it at least once a week. Let me count the ways.1. &#160;It's on an easy bus route for me, nestled in the ID. There's a ton of Asian grocery stores nearby so I can eat and then go shopping for dinner.2. &#160;It's fairly busy (lots of Chinese and Vietnamese coming from people nearby) when I go, even at 3pm in the afternoon. &#160;Always a good sign.3. &#160;The young woman who greets me is super nice! &#160;And she remembers me. &#160;I feel so special. &#160;The waiters come by with hot tea and water. 4. &#160;The egg noodle soup with pork and shrimp dumpling is delicious. &#160;I have to fight myself to experiment and find new wonderful things to eat.5. &#160;Which brings me to honey walnut prawns. &#160;Sweet, fried, and tasty. &#160;The prawns had that... bursting with flavor feel.6. &#160;Little bits of deep fried pork in the soup. &#160;This tastes great! &#160;I am careful to make sure that my last bite has a little bit of everything.7. &#160;The dining area is quite clean. &#160;The bathroom is ok, but that's not what I'm going there for anyway.8. &#160;The soup broth is appealing and flavorful.9. &#160;Cheap for lunch, cheap for a group. &#160;I wish I had more friends to go here with me. A solid place to have Sunday lunch. Located in a crammed shopping plaza with underground parking, so bring your best driving skills with you. Oh, did I mention the noodle house is more like a crammed shack as well. Small place, so the wait can be awhile. We ordered the wonton appetizer, it was decent. Something to munch on, nothing spectacular. I got the braised duck &amp; noddle. What they do is bring out your duck &amp; noodle in one bowl and the broth in another. So you get to decide how much broth is in your bowl or have it dry style. A good dish, duck moist and tender. Broth was nicely done. Overall, I like this place. The food they serve is authentic and good. Service was decent. But I'm sorry, I'm not as high as others on this place. To me something is missing to make this noodle house very good. Worth a try though. Excellent noodle broth and service!! Always smiling and attentive. Consistent with their broth. The broth indeed... After seeking a place to grab food tonight with a friend, I stumbled upon the Yelp listing for this Chinese/Vietnamese place with a cult following. Tons of positive reviews, specific mention of menu items people have enjoyed, and multiple references to "the broth" had our interest piqued. Friendly staff greeted us the moment we walked in, the menus were colorful, clearly translated with bountiful photos, and the prices here are 100% recession-friendly. There were also no language barriers, our drinks were always tended to, and we were even offered a fresh pot of tea after we'd completely finished and paid. This place offers phenomenal service from people who actually seem to enjoy working there. Service flowed very comfortably; never rushed, brash, curt, or confusing - all of the aforementioned being culturally-misread, yet still distressing expectants for "round-eyes" eating at Asian restaurants.My "M13" - the shrimp and pork dumpling egg noodle soup - not only arrived in head-spinningly record time, but was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Packed with flavor just as served, I tried hoisin sauce on each bite of the dumplings and was in heaven. And, as promised on other reviews, the broth delivered. I finished it as eagerly as a dirty little orphan with my big white spoon.Until I can either get the English translation or figure out how to pronounce the name properly without sounding too ignorant, I'm gonna refer to this gem of a restaurant as "HKMG", or perhaps just, "The only Asian place I need in greater Seattle". Oh, and on my death bed, I want my final I.V. to be filled with that egg noodle broth. For starters, I am not asian, and I recommend to people looking for good food from any region of the planet to find reviews by people from that region of the planet. With that out of the way, you can trust me on this one. ;) &#160;This place is amazing!!!!The broth, oh the broth. It's not too oily, not too salty, but still has so much flavor... The egg noodles are not stuck together, not overcooked, just perfect.I've had the Roast duck, the braised duck, and the Shrimp Dumpling/BBQ pork combo. All noodle dishes. I cannot comment on the non-noodle dishes, but I don;t come here for those. I come specifically for their noodles and broth, and all the other tasty bits they put in.For what it's worth, I eat a shit-ton of chinese, vietnamese, thai, etc..., and try to seek out simple and authentic versions of these types of foods. I hate grease, and dumbed down food. My Viet friends actually were the ones telling me to go here, over Pho. That takes some respect!Definitely come here! NEED I SAY MORE, my family and I go once a week. No really once a week. The owners are half viet and half chinese, THIS is WHERE you find our homeland comfort noodles. Broth just right, sweet, clear, celery greens, fried pork skin, fried shallots, a little sui kao, a little wonton, a little Mi Vit Tim (braised duck), some fried squid with garlic, jalepeno, bits...OMG its soooo good.....please make a trip if you get a chance, I will probably be sitting there. This place is brilliant, just went for the first time last night, although I have noticed that it is packed full many times when I go past. It is a merging of Chinese and Vietnamese, with many noodles, served dry or as a soup, and lots of other goodies. The fried appetizers are all cornstarch-based batter, no wheat. we had fried calamari which were excellent. Then we had to noodle soups: Egg noodle with Duck in Chinese 5 spice, and roasted chicken with Chow-Fun wide rice noodles (much to love for gluten-free peeps here). Both broths, and our waiter said all broths, are chicken stock, and he said all organic chicken broth. It tasted wonderful, fresh clean and sparkly. Service is 5 star, they even offered to find someone to fix an iPhone with a broken face. Incredible. I will be back. Maybe today.
I've been searching far and wide for a good noodle joint around here and finally found one! &#160;This place was delicious. &#160;We started with the calamari. &#160;It had a garlicy topping and was served with sweet chili sauce...very yummy. &#160;I then had #13, the pork and shrimp dumpling egg noodle soup. &#160;The dumplings were delicate and tasty. &#160;The broth was seasoned well and the noodles had a slight bite (i hate soggy noodles which is my complaint about a lot of places around here)....I just had to add a spoonful of the house chili sauce to get that spicy kick I like. &#160;My husband had the braised duck leg egg noodle soup which they serve with pickled mango. &#160;That was also good. &#160;The duck made the broth thick with meaty flavor. &#160;I would definately go back here the next time I have a noodle soup craving. 4/30/10 First time here, tried the braised duck/egg noodle soup and we also had the deep fried calamari. Calamari is chunky, deep fried in a super light, crispy batter (egg white/cornstarch maybe?). Mmm. The soup broth was excellent, and the braised duck had wonderful deep anise flavor, and the succulent meat was easily picked off the bone with chopsticks. The big surprise for me were the two big, whole Shitake mushrooms swimming in the broth, the texture and woody flavor - delightful. The quartered whole baby bok choy were the only drawback here, found those difficult to eat. We were brave and parked in the Matchbox-car underground garage. As others noted, somewhat small portions. Quick friendly service, clean establishment. I'll be back! Ever since I boycotted Mi La Cay, there hasn't really been a good place for mi around here.... and I now have found the best place! &#160;I've been to this little restaurant several times, and the food has been consistently good and the service wonderful. &#160;Service here is such a change of pace as compared to some other Vietnamese restaurants. &#160;The dishes I've tried are: &#160;Mi vit tiem (braised duck), mi vit quay (roasted duck), mi hoanh thanh (wonton), mi hai san (seafood), crispy tofu appetizer, and a few other things that I can't remember right now. &#160;Give it a try! &#160;But whatever you do, DO NOT attempt to park in the garage. &#160;Just take my word and don't do it. &#160;It may give you nightmares... 3.5 stars rounded up. I guess I am lucky enough to have had the best of the best noodles before since.....this place is just above average egg noodle (aka Mi) place. Braised Duck Noodle is better than any in the Seattle area but it isn't the best I have ever had. &#160;The duck is made well and the broth fits the bill. &#160;However, the portions could use a lot more noodles and mushrooms. &#160;The pickled vegetable that joins the duck bowl isn't needed and I fail to see why they even offer it as it doesn't taste like much. &#160;Got the Mi Long Heo (egg noodles with beef intestine, liver, and other beef insides in a dry style with soup on the side and it was all right but nothing really out of this world. &#160;Haven't tried the fried items like tofu and wontons but I came here for Mi and Mi only. There's only one thing I get here, but it's really friggin' good: the egg noodle soup w/ bbq pork &amp; wontons. &#160;This is the freshest tasting egg noodle in china town and the pork + wonton are perfect!The other menu items don't really blow my socks off but whenever I think of egg noodle, I go here now.PIc of the egg noodle soup I'm talking about: http://ling.swingvine.co&#8230; So feeling under the weather, what should I have? Thinking about a bowl of hot soup made me feel better already. My two joints for soup were sadly closed, and then I remembered that I had saved HKMG into my phone for future tasting. So glad we came here. The place wasn't as busy when we arrived. The Mr. was hungry so he wanted to try their calamari appetizer. Just think salt and pepper prawns, this time with calamari and extra crispy garlic! The calamari was very good and nicely flavored, I didn't think it needed the sauce, but it was good with it too. I ordered the Mi Thap Cam (combination noodle soup) it had a lot of stuff in it, and I also got tons of liver! It was delicious! The noodles are very good and chewy and of good quality. The Mr. ordered the Seafood Noodle Soup. He thought it was good too. We also had an order of chinese donuts to dunk into our soup. The donuts here are a bit denser than some other places. The prices are pretty good, and the portions are worth their price, we felt.The family that runs this place are very friendly and nice!!! Great noodle joint to add to my list! The best Chinese noodle house in the US. &#160;Yes this includes SF, NY, LA, and even the immense Chinese metropolises of San Gabriel Valley and dare I say it .... Vancouver (I know it's in Canada but I had to throw it in. &#160;This place is that good). &#160;I used to live in LA and Orange County and travel cross-country at least every other week and I still haven't found a place that can hold measure up.How good is it?1. &#160;The broth in their noodles. &#160;Sweet, savory, chicken stock that must be mixed in with crack. &#160;Truly addictive. &#160;When I order the braised duck they also throw in pork rinds into the mix. &#160;Adds a smoky salty crunchy texture. &#160;Where-as an Asian "fusion" restaurant might try this to be distinctive, I get the sense this is done because this is the way Grandpa made it. 2. &#160;The made-from-scratch no-big deal this is normal attitude of the kitchen. &#160;A good example is the organic chicken noodles soup. &#160;They throw in a whole chicken innards and all into the mix. &#160;They had warned my wife they throw the innards in although this is the downhome type of meal she was looking for. &#160; For anyone put off by this warning you are missing out. &#160;As soon as my wife took a bite she mentioned to me the chicken was organic due to the taste and texture. &#160;She had overlooked the wording in the menu (the place should really make a bigger deal about it) but the taste certainly gave it notice. &#160;The skin was chewy and the meat moist like good organic chicken should be. &#160; &#160;Really this type of dish can only be done with organic chicken because of the addition of the innards. &#160;Normal chicken innards would just kind of funk up the taste of the overall dish whereas the organic chicken.... well lets just say there was no chicken pieces left floating after my wife was done.3. &#160;The braised duck. &#160;I never really understand the taste of Chinese braised duck till I ate it with rice cake. &#160;That's when I got it. &#160;How the duck fat is integral to the taste. &#160;How the fat can really sing to you if its flavorful in the right way. &#160;Their duck meat has the exact same clarion call. &#160;This duck meat .... how the fat ends up adding its own dimension to the broth and egg noodles.. it haunts me. 4. &#160;The fried chicken wings. &#160;First time I ate I was like "whoa wtf is this?" &#160;Chicken wings fried with garlic, salt, fairy dust..... &#160;It's almost a requirement for our family to order. &#160;My kids will give me dirty looks if I don't order it. &#160;They should add "and chicken wings" to the name after "Chinese noodle house" just because of this appetizer. &#160;That good.All in all one of the better Asian restaurants I've yet been to. &#160;After local notions like one of MSG as part of the "real" taste of pho and a need to make every Asian meat dish into some form of teriyaki, I had completely written off Asian food in Seattle. &#160;Then I walk into this place and it just blows my mind..... You've got to try the roasted duck soup/dry style &amp; the fried tofu appetizer. The staffs are friendly &amp; helpful...will be back for sure. I really like this place! Good noodles, good broth, friendly family owned jewel of a noodle house. This space has been so many different restaurants in the past and I think this one will actually make it. Hue Ky is Vietnamese owned, but the noodles (soup) are more what you would find in a Chinese place(egg). They also have other dishes, Viet &amp; Chinese, some good, some lacking (better Vietnamese food at Huong Binh), but the noodles, yummy and better for a hangover than Pho, not as good as a bloody mary, I ramble. They also have added roasted chicken to the additions for the soup, it is really tasty, on the bone, but chunked up ooh, and I love the pickled jalapenos. I would love it if they were open late, they sit between were I play pool and where I live.
If you're looking for Greek food, you won't find it here! &#160;(except for one hummus appetizer) &#160;It's mostly seafood and mostly deep fried, but it's decent if you're really hungry. &#160;I have a thing for pan friend oysters and that's what I had here, but walked away sadly unimpressed. &#160;Still, in a bind, I'd go back and try something else on the menu. &#160;It's right in the market, so.... &#160;location, location, location. This was a big tourist trap. The biscuit and gravy was really oily. The the gravy didn't have a nice consistency. The crab cakes benedict was very bland. I had a side of lamb sausage and it was served kind of cold. I recommend skipping this place on your vacation. Too bad. &#160;This used to be my favorite place to eat breakfast when we over-night in Seattle. &#160;I'm wondering if they had a change in ownership, because the menu was new and the quality was down. &#160;You can't even order a 2 egg breakfast unless you want scrambled, the combos are all three eggs. (though our waiter said he could get one left off).I got corned beef hash &amp; eggs. &#160;The portion was much smaller than in the past, and my eggs were WAY over-cooked. &#160;The hash was yummy enought, but it was over $11! My son really didn't like his scrambled eggs, either.We tried Lowells (next door) a few months ago because the Athenian was closed (a Sunday??) &#160;I think we're making the switch. &#160;You have to order at the counter, but they have the same view &amp; better food. I fully expected this place to be an Official Tourist Trap, what with it being in the middle of Pike Place Market, plus the fact that Sleepless in Seattle was filmed inside. We tried to play the part--The Boy was wearing a Minnesota hockey t-shirt, and we both donned our best northern accents (ya knoww), but soon realized that we could be normal Seattleites and not stick out like sore thumbs. The first way you could tell there were locals there was the fact that people were drawing the blinds left and right. People who live here aren't used to the bright light, and just like vampires, they shrivel in the sun. Tourists were basking in the glow, while locals were huddling in the dark shadows, skin growing bluer by the minute. Exhibit B: The prices are reasonable. I got fish and chips for under $8--anywhere that caters to tourists would have charged twice that much. Shoot, any regular place charges twice that much. Visitor or not, all patrons can enjoy the stunning view of Puget Sound and the Olympic mountains. The space is really cool, too, with two levels and what I have to assume is the original furniture (although I'm pretty sure the flat screen TV on the wall wasn't there when they opened). The food was as good as the prices would suggest. Not the best fish and chips I've ever had, but still crispy and greasy, as they should be. And the two large Diet Pepsi's kicked my lack-of-caffeine-headache right in the buns. The Boy was super stoked about the amount of bacon that came with his breakfast, although he said it was a little too cooked for his taste. Anyway, all of the above is just to say that it's OK to go there, even if you do live in Seattle. And just in case you get bored, fake accents are welcome. You know when your so hungry your almost drunk. We walked back and forth for hours in a haze. The menu looked OK, seafood specials a nice view, blah blah. Our waitress was this nice mousey girl that was very attentive and sweet, good service is always a plus. The fried corn fritters were yum (cant screw up fried). I ordered a salmon with blueberry chutney. Sounds awesomely fancy and cool but all the while tasted pedestrian (not like the human being that walk across the street, those taste delicious with blueberry chutney). This food did the job that food is suppose to do, make you not hungry anymore. The bill for three starving bitches almost $150! You know when you wake up after a drunken time and regret what happened the night before, this is what this felt like. Finally ventured into this place for a weekday breakfast with a friend. &#160;The view from the top is amazing, and I appreciate the "oldness" factor (booths are super hard wood like you might find on a boat or something else that's cool), but that's about where the fun stops.The service was RIDICULOUS. &#160;Our server brought us two coffees and literally laughed in my face when I asked if they had soy milk. &#160;Fifteen minutes passed. &#160;We still hadn't been brought menus. &#160;We asked a passing server if we could get some menus. &#160;She stopped in her tracks, turned and gave us the oddest look, and kept walking. &#160;And - no surprise here - didn't bring us any menus. &#160;I think my friend's exact words were, "Maybe she thought I said, 'hey, can you look at me for a second?'" &#160;A few minutes later, our server returned and asked what we would be having. &#160;Only then, when he was met with nervous stares, did he realize we had yet to see a menu.After perusing the menu, my friend asked the server to describe hominy. &#160;Even though it is prominently featured on at least two breakfast entrees, his response was, "No clue." &#160;He eventually recovered and realized what exactly hominy is, but feck, come on.The food was decent. &#160;My friend never received her side of ranch that she asked for. &#160;Coffee was topped off in a timely manner. &#160;I don't know. &#160;The whole experience was just weird. &#160;I can't remember the last time I have actually been a little scared of my server. Well, we were on the hunt for Fish &amp; Chips and this place had the cheapest once among the sit down restaurants. Then we also saw that it was used in the movie "sleepless in Seattle". They marked the spot where Tom Hanks was sitting. The waitress seamed still to have a hang hover the way she approached the line in front of "Please wait to be seated sign". Once we got our booth (very good view for that they become the 2 stars), we had to wait a while to be served. Food was not pretty good. To sum, they are in business for 100 years (they have a big banner saying so), basically based on the advertising in Sleepless in Seattle but not for anything else (maybe the view is to be noted). Two words: Happy Hour. If you find yourself at Pike Place Market and in need of a relatively inexpensive beer then head on over to Athenian's happy hour which starts at 4:00 pm. $3.25 gets you a cold draught beer (they have almost a dozen on tap) and a view of Elliot Bay. That said, the view through the darkened and dirty windows isn't as stunning as it could/should be -- and the service comes as frosty as the beer mugs. If you don't mind spending an extra buck or two I would recommend heading next door to Lowells for their happy hour. The selection on tap is not quite as extensive but the service is friendly and the windows are clean. If you're at Pike Place Market early in the morning, this is a cool spot for breakfast. &#160; The best service, no. &#160;The best food, no. &#160;Great view of the bay!Yep, you're in tourista country pardner. It's a whole 'nother food choosing situation. &#160;Not... a Yelp fine dining kinda choice. You know, like finding breakfast at the state fair or something. &#160;There is a shop that sells insainly greasy donuts down the way also. &#160;Athenian would be better.Sometimes not as crowded as other spots in the market. &#160;Our waiter seemed to ignore us somewhat &#160;Our food was pretty average but that was fine, we just wanted a simple breakfast. One twist, even tho we were ordering breakfast, they asked if we wanted drinks from the bar! So, take a look first. &#160;If Athenian Inn is not swamped, go for it! Despite being somewhat of a tourist attraction at the crowded Pike's Place Market, my single lunch experience here was pretty good. &#160;Raw oyster's were fresh and huge. &#160;Service was average. We chose Athenian because the sign says it has reached its 100th years!Well if you;re that old then you're a part of Seattle's history and we wanted to experience that too!Very casual place as expected since it sits right smack in the busiest place in Seattle Pike Place Market.As you walk in there is a sign that says wait to be seated. Yes we waited...and waited...while the hostess was talking to the bartender..and we waited...She finally made use of her peripheral vision and noticed that there's three hungry people waiting and helped us. She was genuinely nice just slow.She led us to a sunny booth that overlooks the water. Great view! I noticed that as you walk in- the bar to my left reeked with timeless history. It's got that look. Really old but comfortable looking bar stools lined up the walk to the booths. It almost made me forgot the whole noisy ambience and I snapped out of it when we got to the booth. Wow! Lots of history there.There is another portion of the Inn where you can let your hair down and get funky drunk! That's the portion I was staring at sitting in my booth. Ahh...! If only I felt like getting silly drunk. But not this year. Although there was one guy who was soo drunk he made my day. He was so funny and couldn't tell the ceiling from the floor! Lol! He was ****faced!We ate of course. I can tell you the food is not what I'm reviewing the place for. Its the experience! Salud! I came with a co-worker who had been here on a previous trip. It was kind of a touristy stop in, since its the place where they shot Sleepless in Seattle. I am not a huge seafood eater, but I am eating more since this is a seafood town. So I ordered a seafood (?????) with salmon, halibut, clams, peppers and mushrooms. It was really quite good. The view from our window-side table was awesome. My buddy got a french dip ( they were out of the reuben) that he said was just OK. The waiter was a bit of a strange guy, but fairly innocuous. Overall, I'd say it's worth a stop if you're checking out Pike's Place Market, and the original Starbuck's is right up the street. Great breakfast place! The farmer's specials are a real bargain and you can get a great view of the gloomy bay. So they have a few no substitution plates with coffee for just under $8. The combos are all some variation of toast/hash browns or pancakes, bacon or sausage, and scrambled eggs. WITH coffee!I don't understand how this place got such low reviews. Sometimes you can't always trust yelp. This time I trusted my gut and my gut was very pleased with the results. Well, yet again, i'M like a moth to a flame. The food is marginal....at best. I don't think the fish and chips should be orange color like buffalo wings! Now to the worst part, the service. I understand that the help needs to make time to smoke a bowl, nosh on some shrums and adjust their ear spacers, but come on, a freaking hour for fast food lunch....never again. Give me the fish sandwich from the golden arches, it may not be good, but I'll have it in minutes!! We were looking for a regular breakfast place to eat after a long morning of traveling. &#160;Not being first-timers to Seattle, we didn't pick this place because of it being in Pike's Place Market, but just because it was close to where we were staying for the evening, was reasonably priced, and had just regular ol food. &#160;I was happy enough with my oatmeal and over-easy egg, and the view was great. &#160;The bf had some pancakes and eggs and something else, whatever it was, not very memorable. &#160;I wish we could have known another place to go to, but it was good enough. &#160;The view is fun if you get seating upstairs, and the food is fine. Hell, I didn't even know that they shot a scene from Sleepless in Seattle here! &#160;Well, it doesn't change a thing for me anyways...My wife ordered the veggie scrambled eggs which come with hash brown and toast. &#160;They supposedly used 3 eggs, but it seemed like they used 10 eggs. &#160;The thing is huge! &#160;I think it's cuz they used tons of veggies in there. &#160;It was ok, I didn't care for it, but my wife liked it.I ordered the crab cake benedict and that was actually quite good. &#160;The hollandaise sauce was just right and not too sour. &#160;The crab cakes part, from what I could taste of it, was delicious. &#160;I also thought the hash brown were better than what you'd find at a place like Denny's.And where the heck was that toast they promised us? &#160;I'm not even sure if I was supposed to get one. &#160;I know my wife was supposed to so we had to ask for it. &#160;Apparently, they don't bring it to you unless you ask for it. &#160;The same happened to the table behind me. &#160;WTF? &#160;Come on, man... if it's in the menu, just give us the damn toast. Although I've eaten there many times, I've never made it to the bar at the Athenian Inn, probably because it just recently extended its closing time from 6pm to 7:30pm. The restaurant has now been there literally a hundred years ( http://www.seattledining&#8230; ), and the bar since 1933. It has a surprisingly large beer selection for a place that seems to cater to blue collar regulars who prefer Miller or Bud Lite, and a nice happy hour menu (try the elk sliders).Along with the pleasantly inebriated regulars (Hi, Frank), it has a nice cross-section of old and young, tourists and locals, and of course it has that view (best witnessed in the colder months, when the sun sets before closing time). It was pretty foolish of me to live in Seattle for a quarter of its century-old life and not stop in for a drink before now. I had breakfast here, The london breakfast (3 eggs, sausages &amp; bacon strips with fried tomatoes)...coffee and toast came to 13 bucks..not bad as the view alone was worth most of that. &#160;The service was very good and though I didn't have a beer they seemd to have a good variety.A very comfy little bar and grill, wish it was around the corner from me. This is my first review. We are regular visitors in Seattle and this is a first restaurant that made such a bad impression on me that I decided to share it. We went to Athenian for breakfast on Sunday morning. The restaurant itself is pretty dirty but you enjoy the great view. The service was Ok but the food was really bad. This is the first time that we left most of the food on the table. Seafood bisque was edible but had uneven texture from the flour or something else they add that did not quite mix in. &#160;My mom took clam chowder and could not eat it at all - never happened to us before. I ordered crabcake eggs Benedict. The bread and the crabcake were yucky. The eggs were Ok. Hash browns were overcooked and too salty even for me (I like salty food). My daughter's fish (fish and chips) had a strange orange color and was overcooked. What did they dip it in? Fried calamary were oily and not tasty but we still ate them. I will never come back again. You get better food even in Dennis. So, this is the place where Tom Hanks filmed a scene in Sleepless in Seattle... though I didn't even know that until my friend told me as we were leaving.. cool, I guess.After walking around Pike Place, we ran into this restaurant randomly for lunch. We got seats upstairs overlooking Elliot Bay. It was super hot that day (Seattle has been breaking records this summer!) and wasn't feeling too hungry so I had the fish &amp; chips. Food was satisfactory. Service was average. Price is about average for a sit-down restaurant. If you're looking for a diner-style breakfast, even on crowd packed weekends in or near Pike Place Market, this is a great spot where you can get seated quickly - as long as you follow my advice and SIT AT THE COUNTER. &#160;Tourists line up forever trying to get a booth. &#160;The booths are really uncomfortable in the first place, being made of hardwood and being about as big as 1.5 people. &#160;They have a really extensive menu, surprisingly! &#160;I recommend the oatmeal and perhaps a classic egg breakfast with sausage. &#160;You're not going to a gourmet place here, but it's exactly what you need if you're going for a standard, no nonsense American breakfast. &#160;They also have lots of seafood options.One strange thing is I think that they're not open on Sundays except for in the Summer, so be sure to check before making the hike and fighting for parking.This is a good alternative to Bacco (another place I reviewed) if they're too full and you're hungry and don't want to wait. &#160;Plus, who doesn't like walking through the Market?! Was down at Pike Place Market early this morning. &#160;A family member flew in and had a half day layover before flying out. &#160;Did my best to provide the "meet me in Seattle" tour and hit some highlights. &#160;After stopping at the Space Needle for photo op, we went to the market to check it out. &#160;Since it was early, and she had been flying all night, we decided to grab some grub. &#160;Breakfast was needed and we happened upon the Athenian Inn which is right inside the market. &#160;Wasn't expecting anything fancy or spectacular (hey this is a farmer's market) so was happy with the bar atmosphere and great views out the window on our table.We got there at 730am, which means I was up and going at 4am due to love of family, so there was only one waitress on duty. &#160;There were probably 10-15 small tables of two that were already there, so she asked us to wait a few minutes which was no biggie. &#160;Expected slow service, but wasn't in a hurry and not holding a grudge. &#160;Breakfast menu seemed to be egg focused (scrambled, omelet, eggs benedict, egg sandwiches - get the picture?). &#160;Variety of breakfast meats to choose from and a few coffee drinks too.We both had the eggs benedict - one traditional and one with lamb sausage since this is a greek influenced restaurant. &#160;The hollandaise sauce was really smooth and creamy so the food was good. &#160;Hashbrowns were bland and the mocha I ordered was pretty rough. &#160;Wasn't sure if this deserved a 2-star or 3-star. &#160;I think overall it was a 2, but if you want something at the market it would be a good choice. The Athenian Inn was recommended to us by the guys throwing the fishes at Pike's Place. &#160;We asked them to recommend a breakfast place and the one of them said Athenian for good food, a great view, and decent prices. &#160;So we decided to go. &#160;They sat us down by the window and the view was great (5 out of 5)! Then they made suggestions and I ended up having the "Athenian Seafood Bowl" (4 out of 5) and a "Frosty Mac &amp; Jacks" (which was from a local brewery (4 out of 5). &#160;The food was good, not great, but good. &#160;However, I would highly recommend having a frosty mug of beer, that experience was great (5 out of 5). &#160;My partner had the breakfast; she thought it was only 3 out of 5 stars. &#160;Basically, it was ok, nothing special, just a regular breakfast.
Love this place. &#160;Clearly a tourist haunt. &#160;Love scott k's analysis (whatever his point :-), but have to disagree on the seafood blast. &#160;I had the Chunk Salmon Saute (on recommendation of the waitress) and it was literally divine. &#160;I think Jesus himself squeezed into my booth for two. &#160;I also appreciated the sour dough bread as a way of sponging up the juice left over from the sautee. &#160;The views are stunning (although the skyline is primarily industrial, loading docks and ferries), so that gives the place a bump. &#160;The 5 star rating was withheld due to the nearly non-existent service. &#160;I was lucky, I got my food rather quickly and drink refills after only a small amount of prodding. &#160;The waitresses are nice and when you get service, it's not rude, they just aren't very attentive. &#160;The food makes this place worth hitting. I really wanted to like this place. Great view, great location, what's not to love? I went here for the first time with some out-of-towners. We probably waited 10-15 minutes, which was fine because it was a busy Saturday afternoon. Once we were seated, the four of us were crammed into this tiny little booth. I had to eat with my arms glued to my sides. The food was kinda pricey, but then again, what can one expect from a tourist spot? I ordered the seafood bisque which was good but nothing memorable. I had some of my friend's mashed potatoes and I have definintely made better ones than what they served. The best thing that I did have was the apple cider ale. That was delicious! Order a pitcher; it's well worth it! Needless to say, I will not be suggesting this place when I have more out-of-town guests. I've been here about 3 or 4 times and had a different dish every time and I haven't been disappointed yet. &#160;Its located on Pike Place Market and their seats are all window seats so you'll get a good view of the water. &#160;If you didn't know already this is also the restaurant that Tom Hanks was in in "Sleepless in Seattle." &#160;Recently I had the biltong which is dried beef on eggs and muffin and sauce all over. &#160;I really don't remember what was in the sauce but it was pretty tasty. &#160;They have really good southern comfort food. &#160;Other times I've had the corned beef and the steak. &#160;I was surprised to see they had Filipino dishes in their menu. &#160;I heard they have Filipino chefs. &#160;I have yet to taste those. &#160;Overall, the atmosphere is good and very Pike Place. &#160;The service is okay and if you don't want to wait for the server to process your check, just go up to the cash register.I wanted to go here on a Sunday but found out they close Sundays! &#160;It would have been a great brunch spot.
Krua's can be great, but read through the menu. &#160;Their phad thai sucks, as do their "thai" specialties.Their fried chicken wings are as good of wings as you'll find in Seattle though.They are also fast and they deliver and their curries are great! Update: I am about three blocks outside of their delivery cutoff so I'm bent about that, but it is worth the trek. &#160;I have never been disappointed with this place, the food or the staff. &#160;Dish-delish.***I've only been here once but was really impressed! &#160;The food was incredibly fresh, staff was friendly, prices reasonable and restaurant was pretty clean and comfortable. &#160;I will be and back and will definitely take advantage of their free delivery! &#160;YUM. I got take out here a few nights ago and will definitely be going back next time I'm craving thai. &#160;I got the swimming rama (swimming angel on their menu), and it was probably some of the best peanut sauce I've had, and the spinach wasn't all wilty and soggy either, like it is at some places. I was also impressed by the fact that they had it ready for me in less than 10 minutes. Granted it was 9 pm, and most ingredients probably just needed to be combined - but still. My only complaint is that this is a place that doesn't include rice in the order. This annoys me because it is unlikely that a meal of only spinach, fried tofu with peanut sauce would give me that sufficiently full feeling I look for in thai :) It would be like ordering spaghetti without noodles...just doesn't work for me, no matter how hearty the sauce is. It's also a little more expensive that your usual thai, but I suppose that you get what you pay for, and the quality here was far superior to most other u-district places. oooh yeah its so good, in fact more than good its great tasting thai food at a great price. We've been regulars (delivery) of Krua since March when we moved to Seattle. Pork skewers, string beans, spicy basil, panang curry, and pad see ew were among our usual items. Mouth watering good food that tasted like it was cooked to where it was supposed to be cooked and not somehow cooked half-way without care to follow through. It tasted home cooked. But something seems different the past few times, the pork skewer recipe has changed, the pork itself doesn't have the same fresh off the grill taste or aroma. Where we once could practically swallow a whole order of the noodles, now they're limp and &#160;not enticing.Has the chef changed? Different owners? Hope it returns to form soon! I had a curry to go.Food is good but the amount of food you get for the money is way too scarce. Specially compared to other Thai restaurants in the area.Probably, I will not be a customer again. Great food, great value, great service. Truly: a must go-to Thai place. &#160;Enough said. Krua Thai Family Kitchen is great place to get some delicious Thai cuisine for a reasonable price. The place is a bit small and the food is served with the intention of being a family style meal (i.e. sharing) but that doesn't stop it from having some great dishes. Service was prompt despite only having three people working and the waiters were quick to refill drinks and take orders. Definitely going back again. Krua can be Krual on your wallet, but delivers a scrumptious set of Thai fare.I got Krua for delivery on a whim because I always pass this place on the 74/30. &#160;I got the Krua Sampler and the Autumn Curry with Chicken. &#160;The Krua Sampler comes loaded with fried food and Satay Chicken. &#160;The fried side include Spring Rolls, Shrimp Wraps, and Crab Rangoons. &#160;The Satay Chicken comes with this really great peanut sauce that I ended up smothering over each bite of chicken. &#160;Though the Spring Rolls were uninspiring, the Shrimp Wraps and Crab Rangoons had an interesting twist. &#160;Both are mixed with cream cheese before getting thrown into the fryer and dipped into sweet and sour sauce. &#160;I have to say, Seattle is really testing my boundaries of what cream cheese goes with, and I'm loving it. &#160;Both were pretty good, but having the shrimp and crab was a little bit overwhelming and heavy. &#160;I'd definitely recommend trying one of the two though to confuse your taste buds a little. &#160;I preferred the shrimp.I wasn't really sure what to expect with the Autumn Curry with Chicken. &#160;The ingredients (kabocha pumpkin, red and green bell peppers and fresh basil leaves in red curry) definitely sounded appealing, and it was nearing Autumn, so I went for it. &#160;First things first, this place knows how to make a curry. &#160;The consistency is perfect and all the ingredients were fresh and contributed to the final product. &#160;Overall, the curry was a little too sweet for me (probably because it was a red curry and was loaded with that delicious pumpkin), but it was still good. &#160;Next time I'll opt for a different curry so that I don't get the double whammy of heaviness from cream cheese and sweet curry.Another great thing about this place's delivery is that it comes in really clean and convenient containers (i.e. the curry came in a tupperware container), which not only adds to that ever-growing collection of tupperware in your cabinet, but keeps things from getting soggy and all over the place en route to your house.Also, be sure to order before you even get hungry. &#160;When they say an hour wait, they mean an hour wait, and then some. &#160;I think I ended up waiting &#160;a little over an hour and a half. &#160;I don't mind waiting, but the wait itself was killing me in that last half hour.All in all, I'm definitely looking forward to another day when I'm too lazy to whip up a meal at home so that can eat another Krua creation.GET: &#160;Peanut Sauce, Shrimp Wraps, Curry
Bacco was first on my list for Breakfast... &#160;I specifically went on yelp to do a 'crab cake benedict' search to figure out where I should go. &#160;There were recommendations for Etta's... but it was a little farther from my timeshare and more expensive so I decided to go to Bacco's even though it only had a rating of 3 Stars.I was not disappointed with my crab cake benedict... &#160;The crab cake was cooked perfectly and the hollandaise sauce was tasty. &#160;My friend had the crab omelette which was REAL good too. &#160;The side of home fried potatoes was REALLY good!We saw them juicing it up for other customers but neither of us was in the mood for juice, so I just had a glass of mimosa which was decent.I would come back for another crab cake benedict and crab cake omelette because of the price and the quaint-ness of this little joint :) I've passed by this place a few times while walking towards Pike Place Market and I finally had the chance to stop by.I had ordered the Apple Gorgonzola Salad with Chicken Breast- amazing! It had an orange/citrus dressing and was very delicious and well sized for the price. My friends ordered paninis and the french toast with the italian sausage on the side (very very delicious).What's different about this place is that they offer a juice bar with around 10 choices for a 16 oz glass of juice for $4.50. Not bad- but we didn't get to try it since we came a little too late. Definitely something for our next visit.Breakfast served from 7 am- 3 pm and Lunch is from 11 am - 3 pm.Also noteworthy: cute presentation of each plate of food! Visited here for breakfast while on vacation. Bacco was suggested by the hotel concierge as a favourite. The menu was interesting and there was something for everyone. Decor is great and layout is appealing.My Italian omelette was acceptable, the belgian waffle was somewhat small, granola &amp; yogurt $11.00 and the side of fruit for $3.50 was downright robbery. Come on Bacco - you are next to the market - plucking six grapes, slicing two strawberries and offering razor sliced melons is hardly great client value.The tab for 4 breakfasts with one fresh juice and two coffee was $60.46 with tax. Ouch! Terrible service but delish food! &#160;I had the crab bennies and roasted reds, our breve coffee was great! &#160;I would have given 5 stars if the staff didn't act put out to every guest, my Hubby and I are super low maintenance and just watched as just about everyone that came through the door was snubbed. 3.5 stars Leaning more toward the juice bar, remains my place to-go for a weekend juice (especially when you need one of those hangover-recovery hydration!). I could have given it a 4-star again, but they need a better ventilating system. The last few times I was there, I walked out smelling like a walking plate of food. Their Brioche French Toast is the best! This is a very quaint restaurant that is first come, first serve so get there early before the tables fill up. They have a very basic menu that does not have too many items to choose from however, the dishes are top notch. You must eat here for breakfast before heading to the Pike Place Market. My boyfriend and I stopped in to Bacco for breakfast while in town on vacation. We sat outside in the courtyard area to enjoy the absolutely gorgeous August weather. I have only ordered eggs benedict on one other occassion and that experience (a overly salty, overcooked mess) &#160;was almost enough to deter me from ever trying again, but I gave it a try with high hopes for my second attempt. Success! This was SO yummy. The eggs were perfect and the hollandaise sauce was great. My boyfriend loved his omelete as well. Service was quick and friendly. I would definitely try Bacco again in the future! Walked in and they were very busy but the staff was gracious and quick to let us know that they would have something soon. We sat the bar as it was just two of us. We had the carrot, apple and ginger juice. It was very good. The young man working the juice bar was very nice. The ham and cheese omelet I ordered could not have been prepared better. The entire meal was great and our server was very nice. We will return! Good atmosphere... cold Crab Benedict would have tasted better warm. My husband and I were looking for a good breakfast while sightseeing at Pike Place and this was definitely it. The food was very fresh and delicious and our server was lovely despite how crowded it was. Oh, and the fresh squeezed orange juice was superb! Really yummy crab sandwich; I'm still thinking about it the day after. &#160;The sandwich is made with crostini bread. I ordered &#160;a half, and it was the &#160;perfect portion for lunch, since it came with a salad or soup. Ambience of the place reminds me of France. The food was good (but then there's always excellent and outstanding) however, I didn't appreciate having to go outside and walk to the other end of the building to use the restroom.Nice location, friendly staff We stopped by prior to heading into Pike Place Market and were happy we did. Although the space was a bit small, I heard rumor of there being an upstairs. We enjoyed the original Eggs Benedict and the Smoked Salmon Benedict. Both were great. &#160;Was a little surprised by the price, but the food and the service was perfect for a drizzly Saturday morning. This is a 3.5 star rating.When my boyfriend and I were staying in Seattle and I had a mean craving for a waffle, we headed here for brunch. Obviously this is a great location. Considering how busy it was for a Saturday morning the wait was not bad at all.But on to the food!The juice bar was underwhelming, quite honestly. Banana overwhelmed the two different juices we got. My waffle was fine, but nothing to write home about. I will say that the potatoes that came with his food were incredible, I stole so many that I began to question whether or not he was going to make me pay. Crab benedict was ok. &#160;Bit too pricey for the amount of crab they put on it. &#160;My husband ordered a side of chicken sausage..$3.50 for 1 sausage!!! &#160;$4.50 for a plain cup of orange juice..half which was foam. &#160;It was good, but not for the price. &#160;Service was good but the place is a bit cramped and noisy for my liking. Cute place. Average-good food. Great juices. Nice service. Found dirty leftover food pieces on my napkin and on my boyfriend's place setting. It happens. Not mad atcha! The eggs, crab, and avocado Benedict is here is good, not great, but good. It's a nice little restaurant that has a good juice bar. Those two items came up to be about $20 so its not super cheap but neither is anything else around this area so its appropriately priced. The staff here are nice though. Decent breakfast place just a few steps from Pike Place Market. The waitress recommended I order a breakfast sandwich with sauteed spinach, bacon, eggs, and gruyere served up on brioche toast. I found the dish to be heavy and soggy given the combination of ingredients. With the abundance of gourmet foods at the market, I don't see a reason to return here again. Apparently their juices are well liked, although I did not try any. The meal itself was too filling.
Chupar "to suck" and cabra "goat", literally "goat sucker"...hmmm yeah, but this place definitely does NOT suck! Funky decor, with Japanese tea lanterns dotting the ceiling, random "art" (there is a 3D version of the Last Supper) and inviting seating area (including an outdoor patio for the 30 nice days we have each year). &#160;I ate at the bar, and the bartender was very nice/fast/attentive. My Salty Dog (grey hound with salt on the rim) was par $3.64. My friend's Bloody Mary was only slightly above par $5.45. Lame garnish = lime and olive, but cool toothpick = Mexican flag. I have to say, my Chilaquielas, at $6.95, were really damn good! I WILL BE BACK!Pros:Unique spotFilling + quality foodGood for dates or conversations with friendsThe Price is Right!Cons:Cocktails were only so/soParkingProbably not good for large groups A good local spot to grab a beer and eat some alright Mexican style food. The price of food and drinks are within a reasonable budget and the sort of dark ambiance is comparable to the more expensive vibe you get from the Cha Cha on Capitol Hill without all the drama of that area. The bean dip is amazing! With just a little bit of cotija cheese on top with their tortilla chips is a great snack or beer accompaniment. If you are looking for a new place to grab a beer and want a relaxing environment and chill people try this place out. My palate's incessant enthusiasm for Mexican peaks lowbrow (El Asadero) and highbrow (Barrio or Little Water Cantina). And the valley between is populated with places like El Chupacabra: standard, fresh and cheap Mexican without much authenticity or creativity. Yet lest I damn with faint praise, this spot nevertheless offers some features of note that, given the right occasion, might justify a return visit.First, the patio. Nestled at the PhinneyWood curve, it affords a lovely eastern view and the chance to sit outside without being constantly interrupted by vehicular traffic or panhandlers (two constant features of much outdoor seating in Seattle from the Hill to Belltown).Second, the avocado. Each little soft taco arrives with a thick slice plopped on top: a nice touch given the very cheap prices (about $6 for a plate of three). Even the decent guacamole is only $3.50: memorable it ain't, but good and cheap it is.Third, the sauces. On the one hand, I swirled copious amounts over my carne asada tacos primarily because the steak itself lacked much of its own spice or seasoning. On the other hand, the rojo and tomatillo salsas (there's also a pineapple salsa as well) were nice flavors in their own right and made for a good combination: tasty in a different way.Fourth, the vegetarian-friendly menu. Not only are there veggie tacos and burritos on offer, but you can get fake meat and then still order a "traditional" taco. I didn't try it so can't comment on its spice or convincing texture, but it's nice to see that on a menu as cheap Mexican food doesn't often have much that's vegetarian-friendly.Drinks were cheap, but I suppose you get what you pay for as my mojito was merely okay (weak and watery, although the prominent mint redeemed it a bit). Service, as others have noted, comes without a smile: our server was efficient but barely offered a hello. And you will not be able to hear yourself think if you sit inside as the interior is tiny, crammed, and busy (so sit outside if you actually want to have a conversation as opposed to focus on eating and drinking only). So...if I have options, this isn't likely to be my first pick. But if I'm craving a patio and avocado and squeeze-bottle salsas, it's good to know there's a cheap spot that will satisfy. After a shaky start I ended up really liking this place. Having never been here before, we weren't aware of the list inside you're supposed to sign up on if there's a wait and the server we asked about seating seemed really put off that we hadn't figured this out ourselves. Honestly, we would've taken our business elsewhere after that experience if we had another option in mind. But we didn't and so we signed up and waited. The wait was on the long side but that was understandable considering that it was a nice day out and we insisted on sitting outside on the deck. The wait was made easier by grabbing a beer at the bar. Our server (different than the previous one we encountered) was really nice and accommodating. The menu has a lot of vegetarian options which was really appreciated by my vegetarian girlfriend and the prices were surprisingly modest. We both ended up ordering the soft tacos, me with the two types of chicken and one steak, her with the fake chicken. Really tasty. The bartender's margarita was really good too and our server always paid attention to us and was super nice. I'd go back for sure, now that I know about the sign-up list :) This place is great! Sat on the patio and ate delicious fish tacos in the sun! I thought the service was really great as well, our server was attentive and very friendly! I highly recommend this El Chupacabra to anyone who loves Mexican food! Mmmmmm, cheap tacos and yummy salsa. Yes please!I've been by here so many times but never went in to eat...until Sunday. We came here with some friends and after hearing that the service sucked really bad, I wasn't sure what to expect. The place wasn't that busy so we were greeted by a server and seated right away. It did take a very long time to get a glass of luke warm water (no ice) and then for the server to take our drink order. Once that was done, it took probably 10 more minutes to get those drinks. I figured if the drinks took this long, the food will too. I was right.About 30 minutes later, our table of 6 got our food. Worth the wait in my opinion! I got 3 soft tacos, one with chicken verde and the other vegetarian. The chicken taco literally only had chicken in it. No lettuce, tomato, nothin'! The veggie tacos were overflowing with goodies though so that made up for it. Best food I tried was the black bean and cheese taquitos. They had a ton of flavor and just the right amount of crispiness. Delish!The food was great and although the services was a little slow, we had time to look at the bad ass decor and chat with our friends. Good times. I am pretty crazy about El Chupacabra, which has earned more than a few quizzical looks from friends and acquaintances. Why does no one love this place as much as me?! &#160;Do you hate ordering a meal that costs less than $6?? Do you hate dining on sunny decks?! Do you hate an eddgy Mexican meets punk-rockabiliy vibe?! Do you hate people watching in a room full of young, interesting looking Seattleites? Finally, do you hate $6 margaritas served in a pint glass??? Seriously people - El Chup is rad. Get with the program. Great mission-style Mexican food is to be had here. It's also ridiculously inexpensive. Most menu items are 4-8 bucks.We've always gotten prompt service when we've come in. It's usually pretty crowded, so add your name to the list and grab a drink at the bar. On nice days, there's often a much longer wait for patio seating.This is our go to place on hot days, as there's nothing more refreshing than a delicious house margarita and the pomegranate mojito is to die for.I see a lot of people with kids here, but I'm always taken aback, as the jukebox does not have the most kid-friendly selection. There's nothing that says "family-dinner" like Dr. Dre rapping "I just wanna f*** bad b****es, all them nights I never had b****es." I don't fault the restaurant for this, I personally love that their jukebox selection was hand-crafted to create a desired Californian sound and atmosphere, I like the music that plays here. I just find it peculiar that so many people bring little kids here. I just could not quite bring myself to label this place A-OK. There are several things that are not OK. The "theme" can be described as skull and crossbones of hipster meets dia de los muertes. That's great, I love black and Iggy Pop. Tattoos and dread locks are also welcome. Too bad the jukebox didn't work. The "hostess" or "busgirl" was pretty darn rude. I asked her two questions: "Is this open seating" and "do I write my name on this list or do you?" There was an awful amount of turse scoffing in reply. The half an hour wait then commensed. There was &#160;no room in the bar to have a drink. And the bartender was rude too. We finally sat down and our waitress was SUPER nice. Too bad the waitresses are left with the customers who have been all but insulted for the duration of their wait. The food was also amaze-balls, the only complaint that I have is that the chips were stale. I ate them anyway. How can they be warm out of the oven and stale at the same time? HOW???Tons of vegan/vegetarian options too. Almost the majority is vegetarian. Our food came promptly and I was far from dissapointed about my fake chicken soft tacos. There were a lot of left overs. Sadly I will probably come back. Absolutely not with a group though, I can't imagine having to deal with the seating/billing for a group there. Hopefully they won't spit in my food after this review.... I hate the smell of the place.Cheap food prices, but Iong waits, and tiny seating areas. Just went to the new Alki location (never went to the other location.) First impressions: loved the cool/kitschy decor, sort of mexican/spiritual/catholic/skulls/chupacabras! They have multiple murals and wacky paintings. In the cool nook-booth we sat in, there was a picture of the last supper. Yeah, it's different! Also have a nice peekaboo view of the water from that booth. In the summer, on the 5 days a year when it's warm enough, you can also sit on the outdoor patio, which will have an even better view of the beach/water and of course people watching. I'll definitely be back for one of those days.House margaritas are $6 and super yummy. I had to have 2. You have to pay $1 to get the basket of chips. Salsa is free and you help yourself to the salsa bar in the back of the restaurant. Also paid $4 for the guacamole. Both the salsa and the guacamole were yummy.For my main course, i got the cheese enchiladas which come with rice and beans on the side. The beans were refried beans. Not sure if it's an option, but next time i'll ask if i can get whole beans instead.The other folks with me ordered the posole soup. they couldn't stop raving about it - if you eat pork they highly recommend it - they said they will definitely get it again next time! People in my group also ordered a chicken burrito and pork tacos. Everything was tasty and enjoyed thoroughly.Only negative i could say about the food was that the edges of my enchiladas were burned (and i don't mean slightly overcooked, i mean the edges were BLACK and inedible) but it was just the edges, the rest was very tasty. &#160;I'm sure they'll get the enchilada thing straightened out soon. They are a brand new location so they are probably breaking in new cooks.The service was prompt, friendly, and everyone had a great attitude.The cost here is about half what you would spend down the street at Cactus. Of course, Cactus is a fancier, more upscale environment/experience. Definitely a totally different vibe here. However, if you are looking for straight up good mexican food and yummy margaritas, this is a great place to go right on alki. I will definitely be back, i'm thinking fairly often. Fantastic happy hour, wonderful staff, spotty music.But I mean, I've only been once, perhaps the barkeep was playing incubus because he thought it was funny. Either way, it's worth a visit. Also, giant basket of chips and salsa for $1. Yum! &#160;I loved this place! &#160;It's in a house, which normally I don't like but they've opened it up so once you're inside it seems like a regular restaurant space. &#160;I had a pork carnitas enchilada and it was the best! &#160;Even the flour tortilla seemed to be better than a regular tortilla. &#160;And the sauce: delicious. &#160;Beans and rice: delicious too. &#160;This review is for a lunch at the Greenwood location... sounds like they get busy at dinner but for lunch it had a great relaxed vibe with good music. One of my favorite go-to restaurants in the city and seriously the perfect place to chill and have fresh/tasty/cheap mexican food. -Most definitely the ideal place to consume a truck load of delicious chips and salsa too- Fresh, delicious Mexican food in generous portions. They have several bottles of homemade salsa on each table, which is kind of a fun do-it-yourself chip and dip festival. Don't like the pineapple mango salsa? No worries--try the chipotle one instead.It's small and crowded, though, so don't expect to be waited on hand and foot. This has been our go-to place for fantastic margs and decent grubby (but not authentic) mexican. We've even brought our kids there during the day - it isn't set up for kids but it works when you need a margarita before the science center. This isn't Red Robin - there isn't any flair or birthday songs. The servers here might not even smile at you but they get you to your table as fast as they can and bring your food right the first time. We'll keep going back. YUM! The fake meat makes a very good burrito! And I appreciate that they offer vegan cheese, although I'm generally fine just going cheese-less. But it's very easy to ensure that you get a vegan burrito at this place (if that's what you want), and it is hearty and filling! Also love the various sauces in the squeeze bottles. I have been frequenting the Greenwood location since it opened, at least 5 years now. I love the mix of eclectic music and affordable tasty food that definitely has an air of 'real Mexican' to it. If you like pork tacos you can't go wrong here. The bartenders are efficient and very nice if you aren't jerks to them- esp Rachel and Josh. People who don't like noise, tasty food, and great drinks should stay very far away. The Alki location that just opened has the same atmosphere and will bring some fun &amp; decently priced food to the beach. Maybe the food is better, but we weren't too impressed with the chips and salsa or drinks. Chips were only a buck a basket, sure, but at Peso's you get baskets (with refills) for free. And they were either greasy or stale. And the salsa? Watery, tomato-y mess. Not hot. Not thick. Not fresh. At Pesos and elsewhere you'll get the real, fresh stuff. And the drinks? Weak sauce. Definitely not a place I'd go out of my way to eat or drink at. Meh. I really want to love this place. &#160;First time we went there we were impressed by the vibe, the tasty margs, location, veggie friendliness, etc. &#160;But we've been there 3 times now and each time our food has been "room temperature." &#160;Food should be at least hot when it gets to the table. &#160;First time we thought it was a fluke, but now it seems consistent. &#160;Have others had this problem? &#160;We have ordered vegetarian items each time, so our only hypothesis is that we might have a different experience with meat dishes. &#160;Like I said, I really want to like this place! The 10pm happy hour is great and the taco dinner was 3 good size steak tacos with avocado slices for only 5.95. &#160;That's not bad. &#160; The steak was lean and delicious. The margaritas are good as well. &#160;Nice outdoor patio area on warm nights. Sweet, Seattle... Well done little spot is a great meeting place for friends. &#160;Great food, good prices, friendly staff.... HUGE portions.. seriously, &#160;you could share most of the items on this menu between two. &#160;I love the bean dip served with the chips, &#160;It's in an old house on Greenwood and has a little outdoor seating for when it's not raining (so, maybe three months out of the year). &#160;I like this place. &#160;I'm not sure if it's the best in the area, but if I lived within hobbling distance I would frequent this place for sure. On the day Ronnie James Rio died, I came to this bar. I didn't plan to have these two events coincide, but they did and I'm glad for it. The bartenderess was not only shaking great margaritas, but she was tall, shapely, mature, beautiful, and sporting a Dio shirt in honor of the recently deceased WOP heavy metal icon. I would piss in my own hair to relive that day. I love this bar, it's deck, it's veg-friendly tex mex, and it's awesome metal-loving staff. the food here is GOOD.the prices are CHEAP.the service is FAST.the ambiance is fun and punky. the homemade chips are really good. i guess the only complaint is that i can never get a seat outside when it's nice out! Went to the Chup last Friday for lunch and drinks with a girlfriend. Drinks were stiff and food was fresh - we both had the taco salad. Staff is friendly but not in your face. For a Friday between lunch and dinner, it was quiet enough to hold a juicy gossip fest with my friend. Ok, so I wil admit I have only has drinks, chips, and guacamole there, but they were awesome! Yes, it is a little loud (I mean really loud) and I find myself screaming to my friend, yet I still enjoy going. Awesome atmosphere. I love this place. So it's a dive; that means that sometimes service is marginal, sometimes drinks take a while, blah blah blah. Fantastic cheap food, loud music and a cute little deck. We go as a family, we go on our own, it always hits the spot. I kept here "dont go there it's not 'authentic' just fancy white people food" well screw those stuck up a**holes. The food here is great. Who cares if its authentic enough for some stuffy white NPR listener. ITS GOOD FOOD!! And great margaritas. I shared the pork carnitas nachos with a friend of mine, and they were fabulous. Will go back just for the pork alone.Considering how bad most of the Mexican food in Seattle is, this place is fantastic. And its small so expect slow service. I am updating my review. The girl behind the bar most weekdays is far better than &#160;the former ones, no nonsence and makes a good drink. &#160;I do like their food, the soup especially. I love you guys so much! I was pregnant &#160;last year and would drive up from WS two or three times a week. Six months after all that and I'm still craving it every day. I dream of the carnitas and pineapple salsa, and wake up in a puddle of drool. Thank you so much for coming to Alki! This place is pretty good! I took my cousin from Texas here, who is really picky about her Mexican food. She liked it. The atmosphere is fun, and it's fun to sit on their patio. Prices were decent; I had the pork carnita tacos, which were yummy and about $7. Stoked to try this place because its sort of close to home. Went on a thursday night to get dinner and drove around for 25 minutes looking for parking (I suggest you save yourself the trouble and bus it/walk). We finally got lucky and found a spot. The place was packed which we took as a good sign. But you have to sign yourself up for a table and the sign up sheet is clear across the room. Wtf? Worked my way through the packed restaurant to sign up and saw there was about ten groups ahead of us. Grabbed a menu to study and decided to.wait it out. After about an hour and a couple attempts to grab a staff member to just place a to.go order (someone would always say "Be right back!" or "let me grab a server". No one ever came.) we threw in the towel. We decided to.give it.another whirl a few nights later and called in an order to go. The food was mediocre at best and that might even be a little generous. Yes, it is inexpensive but you are getting what you pay for! Save your time and money for something better.
I'm worried about how I will review this place because I strongly think that it was just a bad night and that otherwise this place might be a lot better..Here's the first no-no .. what Mexican Food place runs out of avocado? A vegetarian friend of mine ordered a meatless dish that relied heavily on avocado and about 15 minutes after ordering and drooling over what she was expecting to eat, the waitress approached our table and told her the bad news. Not only was this bad for her, but almost all of the dishes we ordered at our table of 8 people included avocado as well. D'oh!The service was a little slow, the waitress wasn't very friendly or helpful and when the food arrived some people had to wait 5 minutes for their plate when others were already eating. Here's where it got really bad/awkward...Large groups can never really seem to get it together when it comes to paying the bill. However - we sat down as a group and decided that the service didn't amount to a 20% tip. After asking to split the tab a few ways as we were a large group the waitress huffed and puffed, roller her eyes and said "usually we DONT do this..". We calculated the tip all together and then were headed out the door when we were caught off guard by someone shouting in our direction. We turn around and it's the waitress.. she approaches us and says her tip wasn't large enough and that she was insulted and felt that we should give her more money.Granted.. she seemed embarrassed to ask us that.. but REALLY? For the size of our group the gratuity was already added to the bill and we each gave her a little more than that. I don't know if she had trouble with math or if she misread the bill but she literally asked for a bigger tip. WHO DOES THAT? Especially when they couldn't complete our orders or serve the food together. The food wasn't terrible but I don't think I'll ever go back.. Nice atmosphere, in an old house in Phinney Ridge area. &#160;Have only eaten there once (had some tacos and they were absolutely delicious, and the selection of homemade salsas was really great, too), but it's a really nice place to go have a margarita, listen to some punk or country on the jukebox, and just chill out. &#160;Looking forward to hanging out on their porch in the summertime! Fast review!Dined on Tacos with Fake Meat (Which were tasty!) and a Bartenders Margarita (Just tasted like a normal marg, but was strong enough to make up for the lack of pom juice). The pineapple salsa was delicious, but not chunky like some pineapple salsa I have had before, but still delicious. Oh oh! And the chips were crispy. There is nothing worse than stale chips at a restaurant.EDIT: changed stars. It wasn't that fabulous. Plus it was way too crowded to be super enjoyable.AtmosphereIt was busy, but I went on a Friday evening around 6:30. The seating arrangements could be improved, I unfortunately was sitting next to a busy &#160;walkway and was bumped around quite a bit. I wish that they had more Chupacabra stuff though. Maybe a story on the menu (if they did, I missed it, whoops) The single sad little bat hanging from the ceiling could have enjoyed the company of a friendly goat eating chupacabra. How festive! Everyone wants to see carnage while they dine! Maybe they can put butcher paper on the tables or paper placemats and they can have the patrons draw chupacabra pictures! More chupacabra at El Chupacabra. Cozy, fun atmosphere, but can be crowded (no reservations, but there is a wait list you can sign when you get in).Great margaritas, affordable, tasty food good for vegetarians and omnivores alike. &#160;Stop by and check it out. Yup. Its small. &#160;When its busy, the list is rarely actually paid attention to. &#160;The waitresses have a care less attitude. &#160;But, the beer is cold and the food doesn't cause Salmonella. &#160;See, I'm not like most people. &#160;When a waitress is a little less attentive than she should be, I don't take away a star, I add one. **Only if she has good tattoos. I had very low expectations from word of mouth - but this was just what i wanted! Chips and Salsa: stat! Guac: stat! Margs: stat!Bring that triple threat and it's hard to put a furrowed brow on my face. We needed food - we needed casual - we got it. This is a cool little house on Greenwood with a front porch patio and indoor decor screaming dia de los muertos everywhere. We shared tacos, one shrimp order and one special with smoked salmon. The shrimp were the runner up fave - unpredictably spicy on some bites, nice and tasty for others, but the little shrunken suckers were hard to find. The salmon on the other hand; smack me now- i've never had a salmon taco, but these were awesome! With avocado and a few additions of veggies, i loved them. Service was perfectly punctual and our waitress was stylish and friendly. The margaritas were refreshing and tasty. Not too strong, which boded well for this outing. Overall good dinner out and recommended for a low-key, fun and lively night. Not bad. Food pretty good, service was fine, decent prices and the atmosphere was interesting. I"m a big fan of this place. It's in a great location and bartenders are friendly. The jukebox is one of my favorite of all time- filled with punk and metal (I don't see that enough). The food was great. I ordered a Carne Asada Burrito and friggin loved it. Cheap drinks and happy hour and late night specials. HIMSA RIP Even though I've had some good times here, I can't bring myself to give more than three stars, especially since I think those times are in the past.I seriously doubt I would ever come here on my own anymore, knowing of at least a few Mexican places I like more that are even closer to home than El Chupa, and in fact, the last few times I've been here, it has only been because others wanted to.Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad, it's just not great, I can get better food elsewhere. The atmosphere is dandy, I've always liked the coziness and decor, and on a warm day it is pleasant inside with the door open if the deck outside is full.The drinks used to be real ass kickers, but a while back I realized that the margaritas were just not cutting it any more. I could blame it on the fact that I've found another margarita elsewhere that just tastes so good, El Chupa's doesn't stand a chance, but in the past the sheer amount of alcohol in the would have held them up. Last couple of times I had them, not so much. Yesterday I tried the mojito. It was fine, but that was all, nothing more. It tasted okay, but could have been tastier and certainly could have had more alcohol.And the service? Well, it wasn't horrible, but it started off bumpily enough that one of my lunchmates and I simultaneously had a "WTF?" moment aloud to one another. It seemed like the table next to us had been visited by the server 3 times while we we waited patiently with folded menus for our order to be taken. After that, everything showed up in a pretty timely fashion, but while we had arrived in enough time to order the specials, by the time our order was taken, 3 o'clock had come and gone. No specials for us.To sum it up, I suppose if I am with someone who really wants to go, I'll go again, but I wouldn't bother on my own. Sorry El Chupacabra, the honeymoon is over. Give the place a try, it is a lot of fun to watch the crowd, and the food is quite good. Their homemade sauces that you find on the table and can have with chips or over nachos is out of this world. I wish they would sell it for home use actually. &#160;The deck in the spring, summer and early fall is a must do. Especially on a hot summer day it's great, but you can wait for some time as it's very popular. Cold beers and great food. How can you go wrong. Prices are very reasonable too. Fun atmosphere, comes across as something you'd expect in more of a college area but I don't mean that negatively. The crowd looked to be mostly young professionals, the staff was friendly, service was quick, and the food was very good, although not amazing mexican food. Margaritas were good as well. Only complaint was the dessert - fried tortilla with cinnamon and honey which really was not very good... I hadn't had this particular dessert anywhere else so maybe I just don't like the dessert but I definitely wouldn't order it again. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could. &#160;My all-time two favorite Mexican food joints are Chipotle and El Chupacabre. &#160;Since Chipotle is a McDonald's-owned chain and located a few miles from my house and el Chupe is indepentantly owned and located in my neighborhood, I would pick the later to be the best. &#160;Pool, free jukebox, $2 Tecate, great selection of hot sauces, good prices. &#160;Be sure to get your burrito "wet". I really do love this place, but I just can't give them the best rating, because the service is terrible. They get my order wrong almost every time, which means I have to re-order, and then wait patiently while my friends get to nom away on their tasty burritos. I am always very clear to the server which item I am ordering (because I have a food allergy), and yet they always bring me a burrito filled with an ingredient I cannot eat.One of the problems is that two of the burritos on the menu are oddly named "basic" and "regular," which are suspiciously close to being synonyms. I think new items names would help, because I always order the basic, and almost always get the regular served to me.I would have given 4 stars, because well, waiting a few more minutes for a burrito isn't really that big of a deal, but last night was the kicker. My boyfriend ordered me a fake meat burrito takeout, and was told that they were out of fake meat. So, he said meatless would be fine. He got the burrito (labeled "no meat"), rode his bike home, handed me the burrito, and as I unwrapped it I was not-so-pleasantly surprised to find it stuffed with chicken!! Neither of us eats meat, so we had to toss it. What a bummer.I absolutely adore the food and margs, and the fake meat is some of the best I've ever had, but they really need to step up their game as far as service goes. Great place I would come back here anytime that is why I voted five stars. I guess I come to enjoy the company I'm with and the food. If you are going to complain about service go to place where you are paying for it or join the crowd at fast food crap shacks. The food is great the home made sauce is the best I would love to have a barrel of the salsa with pine apple in it. Very low key and inexpensive delicious Mexican food.
This is an interesting place. I would consider it to be more of a bar than a restaurant, and for a bar, the food is pretty good. For Mexican food specifically, I wouldn't go here, but for Mexican food and pool, sure. Don't come here on 5/5 though. Good because it's cheapThis is probably the best Mexican food I can find, which doesn't say much for the Mexican food available in Seattle but speaks to El Chup's excellent food and atmosphere. Their food is decent as heck, and the kitchen is flexible to accommodate allergies and vegetarian heebie jeebies. They have beer and drinks, which kicks pants.Unlike most places that have more than classic rock on their jukebox, Chup's staff is actually friendly and nice to you. They're covered in tattoos, but it's amazing to see them light up regardless of whether there's a conservative first date couple, a pierced sulker, a group of college kids, a renaissance fair club, or a softball team sitting in their section. I've seen each, and each seems to have been treated well.When times are tight, holidays and ESPECIALLY Cinco de Mayo, it's best to find a calmer joint. They get really busy, and human nature tends to deal you a bad hand. One really fun thing to do is to sit facing the front and watch people u-turn at the door. A lot of folks think that, since it's in Phinney Ridge, it's not going to be divey at all. Guess what. You can sit all night long and see people come in with Indiana Jones or day-hike jackets on, and bet your friends whether they wait at the bar for a table or turn around and go to the stuffier place across the street.Last word: This is my favorite place for a quick bite. If you have a problem with the staff, it's your fault/problem. I hate bad service (see my other reviews), but they seem to have cracked that nut at El Chup. The food? &#160;Eh. &#160;The service? &#160;Wow. &#160;Slow. &#160;The margarita I had? &#160;Eh. &#160;The old time pokey country music that was playing? &#160;WTF?!!!! &#160;The atmosphere? &#160;LOVED IT. &#160;I'd go there again... even despite the "eh's" and the "WTF." I really like the inside of this place. &#160;You feel like you're in a house (clearly it was a craftsman-style home before) and you feel like you're in a bar (there is a bar, duh Lindsey, but the staff are all kind of a punk-flare and I wasn't expecting that) and you feel like you're in a restaurant (booths!). &#160;I found this combo real nifty! &#160;My food was delicious (biiig ole burrito stuffed to the max) but I don't think you get free chips &amp; salsa, what a crying shame! &#160;As I recall you have to order them...LAME...but that is the only negative if you have to find one. There is a biiig outdoor deck for nice days and really good drinks. &#160;Personally, I don't like margaritas but everyone raves about how good they are here. &#160;Not to be missed~ The last time I was there, they gave me two free shots of top shelf tequila.For this FIVE STARS!!!!! I thought their Cadillac margarita was fantastic. &#160;It's not as tart as regular margaritas and they go down a little easier. &#160;Before I knew it, I had finished my third one.I really liked the taco salad thing served in a fried tortilla shell. &#160;I got mine with chicken. &#160;I said no beans, but they included them anyway. &#160;Fuckers. What I LOVED though was their very spicy hot sauce/salsa in the squeeze bottle. &#160;Not only was it hot enough for even me, it actually had flavor. &#160;It wasn't just bottled, tasteless heat. &#160;It was SO good!Although there is only one women's bathroom, I never had to wait, not even once, to use it. &#160;And I pee a lot. &#160;I was amazed. Feh.The best part about the Chup was the company I was with and the deck. The drinks were good - solid marg's if you like them on the rocks. Nice choice of beer. I didn't try the food and really didn't want to. I heard many a mixed review from the people that did eat it, so I won't be rushing back to try it.I do have to give a big ol' star to the bartender in the sleeveless denim jacket with the large 'Scorpions' patch on the back that hopped into his '93 black Trans Am with the T-tops. You made my night. That was so rad!Happy 250 to me! Punk rock burritos and tacos, mophucka! &#160;You best tip, or we curbstomp your ass.I didn't really go inside much. &#160;It wasn't disagreeable and I noticed that the cooking area was open so that you could see totally hardcore cooking in progress.My guest enjoyed the guac longtime, but it tasted a bit too pureed for my taste. &#160;Is guacamole like bbq now? &#160;Maybe. &#160;Everyone has their own taste for it. &#160;I had some shrimp tacos that, after the salsa assortment arrived, went down ok.The patio was a nice place to catch some sun and yelp drama. &#160;So much for passive aggressive. Damn! Its a dive. It gets a star for that. Service was fast, efficient and not very nice. That's what you want it a dive. The last thing anyone wants is to carry on a conversation with anyone. The food was good. I have a agree, its not great, but it is good. They have a fake meat option (That's what they call it), for all the dishes so that's nice. They also have a huge selection of hot sauces in the back. If you can sit in the back booth by the pool table you can browse the hot sauces to your heart's content. The salsa comes in big plastic serving tubes like you see mustard or ketchup in. Its real nice. You never have to worry about running out and they all seem very tasty. Drinks came fast and were tasty. I'll be back for happy hour, but I don't know if I'll eat a full meal regularly.They have a real jukebox and you can hear it so that's another bonus.Lastly, its a Mexican restaurant named after a famous goat sucking monster. Nuff said...Update (7/5/07): On Suday afternoons, the Jukebox is free!!! I've been frequenting this restaurant for quite a while and one would think I've tried many of the dishes here. I haven't. I can't get past ordering their burritos! I always make it a point to go here with an appetite because their large burrito ($6.95) is the size of a small shoebox. Also, this establishment carries Mac &amp; Jack's which is always good in my book.You can order these guys in three different styles: basic, regular or veggie. I'd suggest ordering regular because the fillings include beans, Spanish rice, cheese, salsa, cilantro, sour cream and a meat choice. The meat choices are: Pork Carnitas, Carne Asada, Chicken Verde, Chicken Tinga and Fake Meat. I haven't tried the meat substitute, but they describe it as: a non-meat meat something close to chorizo but minus the pig.I'd definitely encourage ordering enchilada sauce to top it off for $1.00 more. Chips come served on the side. If you want a basket of chips and salsa, it costs a buck. The other items they serve include tacos, tortas, enchilada dinner plates, various snacks, soups and sides. The meals here are a good deal and the most expensive item on the menu runs at $8.50.They also have an awesome happy hour where micro brews and well drinks are $2.50 from 4 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.Parking is a premium around here so you might be forced to do a little walking. I was once here at my local watering hole when all of a sudden some rocker dude in spandex came out and said "hey dude"! through his stringy Izzy Stradlin hair, then I went to the bathroom and walked in on two girls smooching, I then sat at the bar ordered a cold ale and I suddenly realized my sleeve had caught fire from the candle on the top of this polished tabletop!wow what a great first experience! who cares about food with this atmotsphere!! I came for the food and stayed for the jukebox music.As I usually rate a Mexican place by it's chips, this place gets a Best Of from me. Unfortunately, the chips cost extra, but I've come to expect free chips at Mexican places. Why is that? Anyway, not only were the chips awesome, but you get all the salsas to try, not just one.The fake meat was awesome, I think it was Morningstar, and the enchilada sauce on the wet burrito was very tasty. The whole thing reheated well, too.Somehow, the music from the jukebox was all 90s-related. Not from the 90s, but, y'know, just reminded us of the 90s.It was a little intimidating when we got there-- the sign wasn't lit, and when we came in and nobody greeted us, it seemed like the bar-goers all looked up from their drinks at us-- I was surprised the jukebox didn't go "sccrrrrrreee" but then again, it plays CDs. We found a seat and weren't sure if we were supposed to grab our own menus or wait for a server. Eventually we were greeted, and our server was really friendly and helpful. I can't believe no one has mentioned the guacamole! The food is good, but the guacamole is excellent! I'm sure I'll find out something embarrassing like it's full of garlic salt and MSG, but hey, I'll keep eating it, 'cause it's super-deelish. Otherwise, what everyone else has said is true--it's got a fantastic jukebox, the margaritas are tasty, the crowd is fun, and the servers are both adorable and slow. Who cares? I'm still licking the guacamole dish.One more added attraction (see my review of Oliver's Twist): although Chupa feels like a bar, it's technically a restaurant, so you can bring the anklebiters along on your rock-and-roll, guacamole-fueled fantasy. My kid loves the jukebox and the pool table and the chips, and the clientele doesn't seem to mind her as long as she's not running wild through the tables. Like everyone else said, bad service good food. &#160;Having lived in San Diego for a big part of my life, I do not find this to be amazing "mexican" food. &#160;Tortilla's, check, beans, check, rice, check, cheese, check...I can also get all of these things at a hundred other local places it wasn't bad food, just nothing super about it. I had 2 chicken enchiladas one with verde sauce and one with red sauce. &#160;Both were good. .My friend had a pork torta, lots of bread with a small amount of meat and very little avocado. &#160;The drinks were ok, but, I actually like to taste the tequilla in a margarita, maybe I'm strange like that. &#160;There were a lot of people that seemed to be the regulars that actually got waited on and talked to. &#160; We had to flag down down our waitress for service, a drink, the bill. &#160;I may try it again when the deck is open and see if I am more dazzled. so being from cali we had a ton of mexican food joints with the best food i've ever tasted...i came to seattle and had a hard time finding a place like this... but then my lovely roommate took me here and hello... great mexican food... FINALLY!!!yes it's a dive bar and yes the wait staff can be a little brash, but this food... bomb :)come try it and have a REALLY strong margarita while you're at it :) I'm gonna go with bad service + not very good food = no reason to come here, when there are plenty of other places to have a decent margarita. I have had three Chupacabra experiences, and I don't waste my burrito money on them anymore. I cannot even be tempted by the pomegranate margarita...sorry, that fad is over. 1st time: the fake meat in my veggie burrito was just about the least favorite soy meat I've ever had (and I eat my fair share of substitutes). 2nd visit: my generous roomie picked up a burrito for me and brought it home, carry out style. When he was on his way out the door and made the offer, I said, "Thanks, but no thanks...I'm not sure my money is well spent there." He said, "No worries then--it's on me!" and returned a little while later with carryout in hand. Yet again...a bad burrito! I actually had HARD rice grains througout my burrito. If there's one thing that pisses me off, it's a cook who can't even get the rice right. Damn! 3rd &#160;time: my soccer team tried to go there to grab some drinks and grub after a game. We needed to add an extra chair or two to a table, and it was not, I repeat, not crowded in there at approximately 9pm on a Tuesday night. The waitress was so rude to us 3 times within our first five minutes--negating our chair swapping and giving us the "I'm in charge and will tell YOU where you can shove it" kind of attitude that we promptly left without requiring any further services. We were not rowdy, and she was not busy--they stood to make a lot of money off us that night. No dice. We made our way over to the Park Pub, which always seems to have great service and a very decent hummus plate (albeit shitty pizza) and we were much, much happier. I give it 1 star for okay margs and 1 star because the whole world seems to love their deck. I could care less...El Chupacabra has no cachet in my book anymore. It was the name that drew us in... so funny. I sort of expected a dive-y bar, but it wasn't very dive-y at all. The crowd looked mainly like young professionals, still in office attire at 7:30pm on a Thursday. This was almost comical when noticing that all the staff are generally of the alternative, black-garbed, pierced, tattoo-ed type. It was pretty busy there and we were going to leave but managed to grab 2 bar-stools. The food is pretty average, not great, but I'd eat it again. The price is a plus and the atmosphere is fun. When I ordered the enchiladas the bartender asked what kind of sauce I wanted,"spicy or not spicy?" I said, "medium?" He said "spicy or not spicy". I said, "spicy". I get the feeling that's how things roll there. Jeez I had no idea this place was such an attraction. &#160;It is a total dive that I have been to twice. &#160;Once having a pint or two with a friend after getting the hair cut. &#160;Their beer selection is okay nothing to talk about really. &#160;The other time I went in by myself because I had another friend tell me the food was great. &#160;I had some soft tacos. &#160;They were fine again nothing to write to yelp about. &#160;Both times I have gone the jukebox was under repair. &#160;I have never been during the late night scene so I guess I have only seen the "shady" side of the place. &#160;But if the situation come up again I will go back. Okay, so I haven't been back to the crazy goat (or whatever it is that chupacabra means- goat killer? Goat something. doesn't matter) since the time after their food made me sick, and I don't plan to. The ambience is nice-ish. It's in a converted little craftsman house that used to house my favorite (if expensive and poorly managed, may it rest in peace) organic seasonal restaurant, The Stalk Exchange. Incidentally, they had hollandaise sauce with CREAM CHEESE in it!! I digress.So El Chupa is filled to the brim with hipsters, has handsome and charming barstaff, but when it comes down to it, I ate there the first time I went there, had what seemed to be tasty carne asada-ish tacos, then wrestled my gut for the following nine or so hours. Stomach cramps like you wouldn't believe, alleviated by nothing, it sucked. I was miserable. The pain was so bad it gave me chills each time it hit. Like being stabbed with nails. Hot, angry nails. No matter how charming the staff, no matter the fondness I have of the place that was in that place before, no matter how hungry I am, this place will never be my destination hotspot, I will only go there if someone else really wants to go and I've got a full stomach already. Then I'll go and have a drink and look at the pretty people. But I will not eat there again, and I suggest you don't, either. we stumbled in here when the line for red mill was too long.its good. period.not mindblowing, just good.there was only one other table there when we were eating, but the ervers friends came in and sat at the bar. the already lacking service went downhill.but the foods good. period. I just visited El Chupacabra for the first time for lunch (and a beer, and some free pool) and I really liked the place. It's small (especially when the patio is rained out), but around 1pm you get your choice of tables. The waiter looked intimidating with his mohawk, tattoos, and piercings, but was very prompt. helpful. and friendly. The selection of $3.50 draft beers was typical but quality (Mac &amp; Jack's, Manny's, Black Butte, etc.). (There's also $2 Miller Lite and PBR for the budget-conscious and/or lite beer drinker.) The $6.25 Large Basic Chicken Verde burrito was quite tasty and filling, and the shredded chicken was cooked perfectly. Their three homemade salsas (in squeeze bottles) weren't bad (I quite liked the green one), but I really appreciated the fact that they had El Yucateo XXXtra Hot Habanero sauce. I especially enjoyed the music selection, which consisted largely of the more sedate Pantera songs. Coming from Texas, I don't believe I should have to pay over $7 for a margarita with real tequila (not that Cuervo Gold tequila-flavored grain alchohol crap), especially at lunchtime, so I didn't evaluate the margaritas.
The oysters are pretty fresh, service was a bit slow. Must try the geoduck sashimi! Compared to the list of restaurants that they provide for - the price per oyster here is great! The oyster stew was pretty delish as well. I would come back just for the oysters only. Here's a tip- stick to the smaller ones, they're less salty and much creamier!Yum. Fresh bomb oysters and seafoodTruly the freshest, greatest and nicest place to eat oysters! &#160;The seating is a little weird and crazy and makes it hard to get around and share food as well as pick food from the tanks when there are people eating almost on top of it. &#160;The geo duck chowder was too runny for my taste...i prefer chowders hearty and thick with butter. &#160;The geo duck sashimi was WOW though. &#160;As were the scallops...little soy sauce and some wasabi and you're good. &#160;Very good! &#160;Try going to early lunch or early dinner for your best experience...once the rush is in it will compromise the quality of your experience. I almost didn't want to write this review b/c I didn't want to share this place. BUT -- it would be a huge disservice to Taylor Shellfish Farms to not spread the word! :)Amazing shellfish -- oysters on the half-shell were super decently priced (average of $13 - $16 per dozen, including shucking fees). Incredibly fresh, as you literally choose which live oysters you want to try (in a tank out on display).I noticed a huge sign on the wall that shows all the local restaurants in the Greater Seattle Area that serves shellfish from Taylor Shellfish Farms, and all of the best seafood spots in town were listed, including Elliot's Oyster House and Frank's! Went to Frank's the night before and had a great time; the food was delish, but the prices were definitely sky-high in comparison.Definitely going to try and make it here every time I visit my hometown!Taylor Shellfish Farms -- you guys are doing an excellent job. Keep it up! :) I hate Taylor Shellfish Farms. No, hate is too weak. I loathe them. Yes, that's it. I well and truly loathe Taylor Shellfish Farms. Why? They've ruined me. No matter how hard I try, I am simply unable to convince myself to eat oysters anywhere in Seattle other than TSF. Given the plethora of offerings around this city, you can see how that imparts a serious bit of internal conflict within my internals. Good thing I have heaps of briny, irony, silky oysters served sans frills at great prices to cram in there and sort things out. I am both saddened and delighted they are in a part of the city I rarely find myself.P.S. - 100th Taylor review. I rock almost as much as the oysters there! With a fresh and vast selection of oysters, who'd go anywhere else? Melrose Market is such a welcome addition to Capitol Hill in the last year (almost 2?) With adorable shops it's almost hard NOT to shop here. Taylor Shellfish is a favorite of mine because of the quality of the service and the quality of the products. Selection is top-notch, prices are competitive and I even heard they have geoduck chowder? My stomach is growling just thinking about that! Can't wait to come back and get more fresh food. You're nuts if you're not shopping here! I'll keep it simple. This place "F**king ROCKS!! Hands down, the cheapest, freshest oysters in Seattle. Just an FYI, this is an Oyster market where people go to by fresh PNW oysters and they just happen to have a few tables so you can enjoy some freshly shucked, yumminess while there. Its not meant to be a sit down service type of place.Lighten up people, the Oysters here are totally worth it!Also, to the people complaining about price and recommending Elliot's, remember this. Elliot's has a 1 dozen limit per person for their happy hour and a 3 dozen limit per table. If you love fresh oysters, this is a must go! &#160;If you expect fish and chips, this is not the place for you. &#160;Highly recommend the mix oyster platter so you could sample 7 different varieties. &#160;I think they offer $4 off the oyster platters during happy hour. The geoduck sashimi was so tender and sweet. We also ordered clam chowder and that was pretty tastey. &#160;Service was great and price is reasonable for the quality of food. &#160;I can't wait to go back again. I'm here alot. One of favorite oyster places! Very well priced... and they have a HH. I literally ate a whole dozen today. David, my oyster officer, recommended the Virginica and Shigoku oysters based on my flavor profile, and I love them. Thanks to him, I left fed and educated!- Trotten Inlet Virginica: My ultimate favorite. David shucked the most beautiful, supermodel of an oyster. I never thought of an oyster as being sexy and lovely, but it truly had the most perfect slightly concaved shell with lovely plump oyster resting in the middle. I 'almost' felt bad for slurping it down ... briny then sweet and earthy. I think of this one as the prototypical oyster.- I also love the Shigoku because of the perfect shell scoop that perfectly houses this oyster. Beautifully briny, with a bit of melon sweetness, perfect proportion of meat and juices. Also if you are texture-sensitive, it's not a slimy and squish, more firm. Apparently because of being tossed around more in the ocean.- Olympic Oyster - this poor little oyster almost was driven to extinction :( very intense metallic flavor though a bit sweet.- Kumamoto - a little too mild in flavor for me. My friend who doesn't "love" raw oyster (I know, what's wrong with him!) liked this one the best. A good starter oyster.- Geoduck chowder - creamy, large volume of geoduck in the chowder. Get over the look of this phallic mollusk. I can understand how those with amateur palates could lack the appreciation the milder, light geoduck flavor. Try it raw. We need something like this in Vancouver. Stat.It's like eating inside a Chinatown live seafood market, but way more hip of course. A few high tables. Beer and wine available. You pick what kind of oysters you want, and it's shucked and served in front of you. Prices are incredible - $12-$19 per dozen + $4 shucking fee. Also received a bit of education on the types of raw oysters. Too cool. If you want to sample Seattle's seafood offerings, why not come here for a shuckirific appy and then saunter over to the fancier seafood restaurants. It's located just on the outskirts of Downtown. These are the best oysters I've ever had! The staff is super friendly and I just got a great vibe from this place. REALLY delicious oysters. It's pretty affordable. Mmm, I can still remember the slightly al dente texture and gorgeous savory flavor of the spot prawns we purchased this summer at this store. &#160; I have also purchased mussels, claims, crab and various sundries at this store and all were top notch. &#160;The spot prawns were a recommendation from one of the guys at the store--he told us how to cook them and they were the bidness. &#160;Not often you get big gorgeous spot prawns at a backyard BBQ. &#160;The cioppino I made from their shellfish was very much enjoyed--I've definitely found a solid seafood go to that isn't as far from downtown as mutual fish (though I continue my seafood love affair with MF). &#160;The guys who work here are awesome. &#160;FAN. Give me an &#160; &#160;O !Give me a &#160; &#160; &#160;Y !Give me an &#160; &#160;S !Give me a &#160; &#160; &#160;T !Give me an &#160; &#160;E !Give me an &#160; &#160;R !Give me an &#160; &#160;S !What does that spell? &#160; OYSTERS! Oysters Rock. &#160;And so does this place. &#160; Mmmmm... nom nom nom. Nom nom nom. &#160;I love oysters so this was the perfect place for our light lunch Sunday! &#160;This place is casual and there weren't many tables but luckily we got a spot as it was not too crowded.I loved the tanks of seafood, the oyster map and the seafood books scattered throughout. &#160;The lady told us they served cooked crab, oysters, squid salad and soups but they later told us they didn't cook it on the spot but they had a few prepared pieces of crab. &#160;Some of these reviews are also saying they would cook all sorts of things on the spot and to my dissapointment, they didn't. &#160;I thought we would be able to order clams and mussels and the such but no such luck.My 2 friends and I shared:-2 oyster stews and 1 geoduck chowder plus bread-1 dozen oysters. &#160;We got a variety of oysters including the Olympia and some others that I don't recall the names of right now.The oysters were delicious. &#160;There was a bit of variation in the ones we liked and loved. &#160;I can't remember the names, but we liked a big buttery one AND a small sweet one best. We also watched someone prepare geoduck fresh. It was pretty cool and we got to try some fresh geoduck afterward.The prices here are good. &#160;We spent about $13 per person including tip and tax. Next time I am having a fancy at-home meal, I am totally coming here. &#160; I also need to come back &#160;for a light meal or snack plus cocktails next time to try more stuff! This place def. has 5-star potential as everyone else rated. &#160;I need a few more tries, but man am I up for that! Taylor Shellfish Farms is an absolute Gem in Seattle. I only recently started eating oysters, however my parents are huge huge fans. So when they came into town for the first time I knew I had to find them the best. After searching and reading many reviews I settled that I wanted to take them to Taylor Shellfish and boy am I glad I did. TSF is a small little place by Melrose market (which also has a Home Grown which is delicious). TSF has an awesome layout of tons of live lobsters, oysters, and crazy other stuff. We sat down and ordered a few dozen oysters. You literally get to see each and every different type as they are all out in front of you. It is just a great experience and the Oysters were absolutely fantastic. My parents even proceeded to order another dozen, and really made their trip to seattle fantastic.I have come back a few times since then and each and every time their oysters have been fantastic and at absolutely great prices. +1 to TSF for being amazing. AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!!! Had geoduck, crab, oysters and chowder. Everything was amazing, and we know seafood. WOW. Do not miss the chance to go here. It is hands down amazing. Simple menu, fresh seafood, nice people, good service. GO THERE!!!Just to reassure, I do not work there. I live in San Diego and came across this place because I love seafood. IT IS AMAZING!!!! This place has been on my bookmarks for awhile... just patiently waiting for me to make a girl's trip up to eat.Jenn and I finally made our way back up and we happily gorged ourselves here. They have an awesome chowder bar that you serve yourself. We sampled the oyster stew and geoduck and calm chowder. Oyster stew was VERY oyster-y..... almost like every single oyster that wasn't deemed good enough to be eaten raw was tossed in here. We opted for the geoduck and clam which was fantastic.Followed that up with freshly shucked Olympia oysters and the geoduck sashimi.The geoduck sashimi was FANTASTIC. Freshly harvested that morning and sliced to order..... probably the BEST geoduck I've ever had. 5 stars for the geoduck.....I'll throw in an extra star for the prompt service and nice fishmonger. :) Perfect. I would eat here every day if I could. I love this place! The fish is so fresh, and the people are awesome. &#160;One of my favorite spots to eat oysters. Oh and the smoking hot manager doesn't hurt things either. &#160;Yum! Went here to taste some fresh oyster and seafood. They had a good variety of oyster, mussel, etc. We tried almost everything and it was all very good. They had a decent wine menu and a few local beers. The guys were nice and helped us choose oysters based on what flavors everyone liked. Everything was very fresh. Very easygoing atmosphere. No dude, this isn't the farm. The guy in front of me actually thought they raised the oysters here.They have a wide selection of varieties. Come in, tell them which ones you want shucked, grab a beer and maybe some chowder, sit down, and in a few minutes you will be in fresh oyster heaven. If you want to splurge a little get some shucked scallops sashimi style. Makes for an awesome, lunch. Come during the week for the happy hour pricing, and it's an awesome deal Went today and destroyed 2 dozen oysters. &#160;Great staff and atmosphere. &#160;Prices are very reasonable. The fact that I HATE raw oysters yet still give TSF a 5 star rating should really, really speak volumes about this place.---That said, do you know we have a celebrity in our midst?! The humble/handsome/always pleasant David Leck can often be seen working behind the counter here, shucking away (for those of you who don't know, he's a bit notorious for this: http://seattle.eater.com&#8230;) But ask him about his prestigious title, and he'll coyly shrug it off or change the subject :)Whenever I'm trekking home from downtown and meandering up the hill, I always make a pit stop here (along with a couple of other key spots in the Melrose Market) to see if they've got my 2 favourite staples: seaweed salad, and spicy/sweet squid salad! If they do, I always grab a half pound container of each (the price is ridiculously low for such deliciousness).What else do I like here, given the fact that I hate raw oysters? The chowder, the bread, and most notably, the service! Everyone is always extremely helpful and willing to let you try anything your heart desires, so if you've never been here, or if you're intimidated, don't be shy! Ask questions and sample sample sample! You're sure to find something you'll love. Three of us stopped in for lunch and sampled all of the oysters available and all were exceptionally fresh, well prepared and presented, and tasted excellent. &#160;The kumamoto and shigoku were the favorites for all of us.We also tried both chowders which were hearty and flavorful and enjoyed some good cold beers. &#160;Lunch doesn't get any better. Happy happy joy joy!!! Reminds me of that fishy smelling hooker from grade school, only better!!! Very huge fan of Taylor Shellfish Farms!!!This is the only place where you can choose from so many different varieties of fresh oysters on the half shell, while they are still in the water. &#160;How cool is that?The service was outstanding. &#160;Pricing range is very fair, compared to most restaurants and bars. &#160;It was my girlfriend's first time trying raw oyster's, so the master shucker let her sample a couple of varieties before we placed our order.Located right next to Melrose Market, would recommend to everyone and anyone who loves oysters!!! nothing but oysters on the menu!well, that's not actually correct, they do have a few chowders/soups but really, oysters are the focal point of this really nice place in the heart of cap hill and the prices are great! (between $12-$18 for 12 freshly shucked oysters depending on the type).bottom line: fresh, cheap, fast. definitely come here if you're just in the mood for fresh oysters without any commitments. I loved the oysters here. I tried 4 different kinds and they were just the fresh and so damned delicious!! The workers are super nice too, but can I really give this place 5 starts? Nah I just can't do. &#160;There is just something off about the service. I kinda wanted to give this place 4 stars but I don't think I can do that either. Its kind of weird here. There really isn't a menu. There aren't really any waiters or waitresses, it more like cashiers who now have to shuck your oysters. Its not really a restaurant, but it kinda is a restaurant and store combo! You'll have to go for yourself. I really hope they expand and turn this place into a real restaurant. As much as I like my oysters, it'd be nice to have some good food with it! That would be super awesome! Love this place! It was my first time ever to try eat raw oysters. The server was very helpful. She explained the difference of taste of each oyster. They have excellent selection of fresh oysters and good price. Very refreshing feast for the summer! Yes! I finally got to try this place out! On my latest visit home to Seattle I made sure to make a stop here and indulge in some amazing seafood. There are not many places in the city where you can find fresh razor clams and geoduck just sitting there waiting to be eaten. I was really hoping to try the geoduck chowder, but they were pretty low on the supply so I opted for the oyster chowder. Good god this thing was just overloaded with oysters. I couldn't believe the ratio of the chowder broth to actual oysters. Most places would totally skimp you on the actual amount of seafood, but not here! And don't even get my started on how delicious the soup was...As far as oysters go, this isn't exactly the cheapest place to go for fresh shucked oysters but they have a ton of variety. Different kinds go for different prices per dozen and on top of that there is a shucking fee if you choose to eat in house. You can also just get fresh seafood to go. If you like the Freshest, most flavorful shellfish...You need to come here pronto!!!Taylor brings us the most interactive farm to table experience with a custom built, live holding tank - a stainless steel buffet of Taylor farmed oysters, clams, mussels, geoduck and scallops. They also have DUNGENESS CRAB!Taylor's ace shucker, David Leck, won the International Boston Seafood Show Shucking Competition and is on hand to shuck your oysters!The Best Oysters...ask for David...he will hook you up with every kind! &#160;It was my birthday so he did a special for me. David Leck has great knowledge with friendly customer serivce! &#160;I ordered 16 oysters, bowl of geoduck chowder, and blood orange dry soda. It was all delicious!http://www.yelp.com/biz_&#8230;Kumamoto Oyster:Introduced to Washington from the Kumamoto prefecture in southern Japan in 1947. Small deep cup, sculptured, fluted shell, uniform size and shape with clean, sweet, nutty flavor.Olympia Oyster:Native to the West Coast. Only as big as a fifty cent piece. Sweet, coppery flavor.

Attractive pear-shaped shell with a somewhat flat top shell and slightly concave bottom shell.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! &#160;Thank you, David. I love oysters, I will be back!Pro Tip: Oyster Happy Hour 2-4 pm Mon-Fri. They also have nice selection of wine for oysters. &#160;For Private Parties, you can rent the space ahead of time, up to 35 people. Taylor's has made me a fan of Oysters! &#160;Wow!! - so fresh, so sweet, so briny - what a burst of flavors in your mouth! &#160;I can't stop thinking of the Kusshi, Kumamoto and the comeback kid, the Olympia! Will definitely be back .. and can't wait to try their geoduck chowder the next time. &#160;Street parking could be problematic in the area. Got some Olympias, Shigokus, and Bruceport oysters this weekend. This place is a lot busier now since they added beer and wine. On Sunday at 4pm there were probably 20 people inside (and it's not a large place). The word must be out because it seemed like a lot of tourists.....Good price, excellent selection, Tom's the nicest dude ever, and the oysters are beyond fresh.This might be the best place in Seattle to get oysters. Arrived during happy hour and got the geoduck chowder and a dozen medium oysters. The chowder was pretty good but the oysters were amazing! I wasn't a huge fan of oysters before having them here but if I lived in the area I would be here all the time. Nationally famous oysters,now with a local raw bar with great shuckers and drinks.I love going in for lunch on a cool Seattle day. A half dozen Toten Inlet Virginicas, cup of Geoduck chowder and a glass of that excellent Cadaretta SBS. It doesn't get much better.As Hemmingway said"I lost the empty feeling and began to be happy and make plans...." Arrived at SEA, picked up rental car, drove straight to Taylor Shellfish Farms. &#160;Got 2 dozen oyster sampler, and the chowder, OMG, so good, truly the best oysters I've had anywhere. &#160;Some sweet, some briny, some buttery, but all delicious! &#160;Great that you can pick out your own and take home.Considering moving to Seattle just to be close to TSF is a little extreme right? Great selection of fresh oysters. &#160;Geoduck soup was ok... Tasted just like clam chowder. &#160;Nice friendly staff If you love oysters, you gotta come here and buy yourself a dozen...make that a couple dozen oysters! &#160;Yes, they are that good. &#160;Besides oysters, I bought mussels, clams, and geoduck. &#160;All have been top-notch and easily match the ones you get at some of the best restaurants around the country. &#160;And that's because top restaurants around the country get their shellfish from Taylor.The staff has been very helpful and helps to select oysters and even shucks them for a small fee. &#160;The one time I bought a whole Geoduck, he gave me great times to preparing it and it was great eaten raw.If you're looking for the freshest seafood, avoid touristy Pike Market and come here...You won't be disappointed. Great prices on oysters! You can order a dozen of them without feeling as if you had emptied out your entire wallet.They shucked the oysters pretty well, and gave me a fairly generous portion of lemon slices and some sauce to go with them.I would love to come back and try out the geoduck sashimi if I'm ever in the area. I've been to Taylor Shellfish many times but finally had to write a review after yesterday night's experience. Once and for all, I said, "These guys are SO great! I've got to write them a Yelp review." I originally visited the store because I love shellfish, and it was right down the street, but I've returned over and over because the shellfish is fresh, local and delicious. I continue to return now, even though I've moved out of the neighborhood.More than anything, though, I love this place because the guys who work there are 10s. They know how to give you a TERRIFIC customer experience, whether it's being knowledgeable about their shellfish, giving you a laugh, or giving you a little freebie like an oyster to taste. No lie, each and every time we've left the store, we've remarked how great those guys are and how much we love that store. This business truly deserves every success it has based on the way it treats its customers. They've got me for my shellfish needs for life!Just when we thought it couldn't get better, we saw the new tables set up with mouth-watering seafood being served with white wine. We had paella plans at home, but we were tempted to blow them off and just hang out in the store.Run, don't walk, to Taylor Shellfish! They also have a Chinook Book coupon, FYI. I am so ooh goo gaga over this place. Thanks to YELP, we found our first real dinner spot on Friday. Although...it wasn't what we imagined, we should've guessed by the name. It wasn't dinner, but a spectacular appetizer place for us.Walk in, and see tanks of FRESH oysters. About a dozen different kinds, as well as real geoducks. Some bar top tables, and some ladies sipping wine at the front counter, a very chill place to grab some oysters on the go.If you want your oysters shucked, expect to pay $3-$4 extra. So we decided to go for the Virginicas. They were about $22 for a dozen. We also added a dozen shigokus which were a few dollars less.Shucked perfectly on ice with some lemons and sauce on the side. I also tried the minuet sauce, which was pink and I believe consists of champagne, garlic, and some other yumminess. HOLY COW! These Virginica oysters were creamy and divine! I was having a orgasm in my mouth! The shigokus were good too, but HANDS DOWN, all 3 of us have never tasted such mind blowing fresh oysters like the Virginicas! Totally worth the money! I wish I was richer so I could order dozens and dozens to myself!Unfortunately they were out of the geoduck chowder, which I hear is great, so I'll definitley be back for my VIRGINICAS and chowdah! If you are pressed for lunch and love clam chowder, look no further! I walked in at lunchtime, grabbed a bowl of Oyster &amp; Geoduck chowder (it's self-serve), a few fistfuls of crackers and a juniper-flavored seltzer. Sooooo good on a chilly day! This is a badass place to get oysters. Service is a little confusing at first, but you can look around and read the descriptions of the oysters if you're not familiar with all the different species. Then go up to the front and order! Hopefully you can grab a seat and it'll be brought to you, and then you will pay the cashier when you're done and thank her for the glorious experience. Got it?I wasn't too impressed with the chowder, but the oysters were awesome. There's awesome geoduck sashami and live spot prawns to eat (which I did not see on the menu). The geoduck was amazing. Sliced thin and served with a little bit of wasabi and soy. It had the texture like squid or clam but with a briny sweetness.You order the spot prawns by quantity (so yes, you can just order one!), and it'll be brought to you live, then shucked live, beheaded, and the head will be presented for you to suck all the brainy juices and then you will proceed to eat the freshest shrimp of your life. Quite an experience. Only thing is that there's very limited seating, and they usually wait until you're seated to bring you your food, so it may take a while. Great fish market as well. Awww shucks... Taylor Shellfish Farms is definitely legit. They are the local supplier for joints like Tom Douglas, the Coterie Room and such.Come dine in for oysters (hell yeah Kushi and Kumamoto), wine optional. You can also take home some geoduck and mussels. Prices are pretty reasonable with a small shucking fee. Downside is that there are a limited about of tables. Went during happy hour and went to town on a platter of oysters! I love this place! I love my Shellfish! Especially when it is fresh and simple...as they do here, at "Taylor Shellfish Farms"!!! This was my FIRST experience here, so I understand the cruel and unusual punishment! lol - I may just have "Anti-Asian" pheromones! LOL This being said, It is a comfortably small establishment with a loud ambiance. &#160;I informed the woman that it was my first time here and she was great! She seated us right away and walked us through the ordering process...My issue was with the "grumpy bus boy / cashier". &#160;I slurped down their Kumamoto and Samish Bay Oysters and would have also tried thier "Geoduck Ceviche" but they were all out. &#160;I will emphasize the fact that I was more than pleased with both my service and meal while walking up to the register to pay...when "dun dun dun" mr. grumpy asked for our money. &#160;First off, he was the one that sucked our oysters and got mad at me for repeating our order to him (very nicely, I may add) and then got even more irritated when I said "I'm sorry, what was that?" when he asked if I wanted to start their "punch card"? Sorry, I'm not even sure that is what he said because he didn't want to repeat himself. &#160;Did I do something wrong!?! :((( I am not going to let one experience, especially a first - make or break my judgment...I will be back "Mr. Grumpy", oh yes, I will be back!!! SHUCK it up and SMILE!!! ...I may not smother you for free food - but ugly girls need love too! :P LOL"Taylor Shellfish Farms" your love and attention do to fresh and good quality is very much appreciated!!! ...my tummy thanks you!!! :))) Scallop sashimi... Mmmm! Doesn't get any fresher than this. I got to pick out my favorite live scallops. I'll be back! Wow. &#160;First of all, thank you to the Seattle Yelp community. &#160;You guys are freaking amazing.This place is bomb. &#160;Seriously. &#160;I wish there was something similar up north in Vancouver.Oysters are so incredibly fresh. The environment is not pretentious at all and the prices are incredibly reasonable (compare this with Yaletown in Vancouver).The best thing ever was the oyster stew that they had going on. &#160;It was loaded with oysters. &#160;Definitely coming back and will be recommending this place to my fellow Canadians. From a kids prospective...Taylor Shellfish Farms has GREAT customer service and &#160;the atmosphere makes you feel like you have been welcomed onto a boat in the middle of an ocean. They serve many kinds of raw oysters and shuck them for you. I had never had oysters before, but felt very tempted to try them after I saw them in the tanks in the middle of the store. I also enjoyed four very large shrimps with my family and dipped them in their delicious homemade cocktail sauce that you HAVE to try. My experience was very pleasing, ending my trip to Seattle on a high note. Thank you, Yelp. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I NEVER would have found this place without you. As a shellfish lover, this is close to being heaven in Seattle. I strolled in here around dinner time on a Saturday, and it was busy but not overly packed. After browsing around the fresh oysters bathing in their comfortable baths, I decided to get a dozen Olympia's, a type of (small) oyster I had never had before, as well as some Geoduck Chowder. I grabbed the chowder and downed it while waiting for my oysters. It was so incredible that words cannot describe it. Everything was in balance, the geoduck was cooked perfectly (not too chewy)...so delicious. Now the oysters - fresh, flavorful, and incredible. Prices - fair for the quality, but high to those who may not truly love what they're eating. Service - good enough. What amazing set up this place has going for it in Capitol Hill! I've done enough trekking down to the waterfront for oysters n' crab. From the fellas who work the front to the fresh seafood hanging out in the tanks it all adds up to an amazing spot. Even if the oysters aren't your thing, they have plenty of savory homemade soups and cold seafood sides along with specialty oyster-paired wines. The guys are superb at service and advice of what your taste buds are after here. Prices aren't that bad either. I got a large bowl of soup and seaweed salad for under $10.00. Next time I'm coming back for that crab! Headed over to Melrose Market to visit this place. It is a combination seafood market and eatery. The seafood selection is primarily shellfish items like clams, oysters and geoduck! They also do have Dungeness crab. Not much in the way of food (the prepared kind) aside from a couple chowders and raw oysters. They also have wines that go with the oysters.I decided to try out the geoduck chowder prior to catching a flick at Pacific Place. I have never had geoduck before. It is a strange looking mollusk. Tried a bowl of chowder ($6.50) with a roll on the side. The price is fair. A little cheaper than Pike Place Chowder.The geoduck chowder is not of the creamy variety that you would find at Pike Place. It is not rich tasting, rather more starchy. I grabbed a bowl that was quite full of potatoes which would explain this. If there is cream in the chowder, it is not enough. The carrots are a bit unusual since they were shaved slices rather than the traditional rectangular shape. The geoduck in the chowder was okay. Could not taste much of a difference compared to a regular clam. I did like the roll that accompanied the chowder. Wondering which bakery makes them.There is some seating, but not a whole lot. The seafood tanks get in the way. May need to take your chowder to go or wait for a table if you are trying out the oysters. Staff is friendly and boisterous here.The geoduck chowder was okay, but I would stick with Pike Place Chowder if you are looking for chowders with shellfish . Go to Taylor Shellfish instead to try out the oysters and pick up shellfish/crab to take home to prepare. An awesome place to get oysters, the staff was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. &#160;I don't know what people are complaining about regarding the service, &#160;I was treated very well and have only positive things to say about it. &#160;If you love shellfish this is the place to go. I'm not a fan of the first come first serve seating because how the crap does that work when you're eating seafood. I would understand sandwiches or ice cream but this set up does not work for a dozen of oysters. Overall, the service and friendliness was okay I guess cause we were a giant group with kids. I would not recommend this place if you're trying to catch up with friends or family. The seafood/clam soup was really watery so I'm not even going to call it a chowder. Also, they server their steam crab cold only. This place is awesome. &#160;Nuff sed The boyfriend wanted oysters; he had wanted oysters for a few days, it just kept coming up. I know what you're thinking, but it's not that. I don't need raw mollusk to be interested in sexy times, I'm smack dab in the middle of my sexual peak; he just wanted to get some briny, sweet, bite of the ocean in him. *Insert fish/twat joke here, but my twat has NOTHING to do with the scent of the ocean. God forbid.*We landed at TSF, and much to the man's delight - not only were we able to get very reasonably priced, extremely fresh mollusk (read happy hour prices elsewhere), but there were two TVs with the game on. You know, THE GAME - SF v. the Giants of New Jersey (let's not play - that's the NJ team and you know it.) So we sat with a nice little bottle of Savignon Blanc, a lovely geoduck ceviche, a dozen Olympias (followed by another dozen Totens) and the TVs that made my man happy, and made it so I could play word games on my phone without getting any shit for it. YAY! .About a glass into it, I begin to give a fuck about football, and begin to forget about my phone:"I want the Giants. Look how shiny their helmets are! So pretty and blue. Mommy likes.""Um - does that guy think this is soccer? THE OTHER FOOTBALL MORON. THIS IS AMERICA. Shit.""OOH. That mother fucker just lost the game for SF. He's gonna have a bunch of roided out sisters up his ass in about a minute."These were the comments that brought the manager over to our table to introduce himself, and got him feeding us a couple Kumamotos on the house, and inspired him to let us stay while they closed up so we could watch that dumb ass lose the game for SF in overtime. And tell us what he's planning for the Super Bowl, which I could care less about but will be watching through a face full of raw mollusk, with my new best friend, TSF manager, Tom.. Awesome oysters in an incredibly casual, low-key atmosphere. The staff is really friendly and you sit at bar tables right next to the tanks of fresh oysters and shellfish whie watching them shuck your selection. The menu is simple - chowder and shellfish with a small beer and wine selection. The oysters are truly fabulous. It makes the higher end oyster bars look pretentious and silly while totally outdoing them on freshness/quality. Absolutely awesome! &#160;This place is very clean and quite well maintained. &#160;The location may be a little bit of a pain, but if you are at the convention center than it is a short little hike up the hill (couple of blocks maybe). &#160;It is well worth the trek. &#160;There is a very nice variety of shellfish to choose from and a nice selection of items in the fridges. &#160;We had a sample of suggested oysters from the owner and we were far from disappointed. &#160;They were fresh and delicious. &#160;They were elegantly shucked from the master (who recently won a shucking contest for speed and accuracy). &#160;I highly suggest this place to anyone who loves oysters. If you're going to eat here, don't come expecting fine dining, but do come here expecting good, fresh oysters. &#160;Just go to the counter and order whatever they say is good. &#160;Then grab a beer from the cooler and sit down and wait. &#160;Repeat as necessary. The place to go if you are into fresh oysters, crab and unpretentious, good service! that is some cheap oysters.i hate having an expensive addiction, but i was able to slurp down some oysters for what broke down to $0.67 each, that's cheaper than most happy hours and i don't have to work with HH confinements. i even found a new favorite - totten virginicas...omy.no frills and gimmicks here, just downright scrumptious fresh oysters. &#160;the one downside is the place is small, so not good for big groups. &#160;that's ok, more oysters for me! If you want very fresh oysters with a myraid variety to choose from, this is the place to go. &#160;I initially came here to buy some geoduck, but also ended up eating some oysters in the meantime. &#160;They will shuck oysters for you for a $4 charge. &#160;I only had the Olympias but they also have geoduck chowder and dungeness crab. &#160;They also have wine to go with your oysters. &#160;The employees are very friendly and helpful.The downside to this place is the parking and few tables. &#160;Other than that I would come here for my oyster fix. Sunday is no shucking fee but it has been getting packed recently. &#160;My favorites are Olympia, Virginica, and Kunamoto oysters. &#160;I will have to try the geoduck next time. Oysters are the best here. Very clean place, friendly atmosphere, and just plain good oysters. I have been here many times and now can't walk by without stopping in to have some. I always just let the Guy choose for me the oysters and eat away. You can't go wrong if you love oysters! YES YES YES! (yes yes) thats 5 Yes's !If you enjoy seafood, especially fresh oysters, then this place is for your. Make sure to come early.The crab is delightful also, wonderfully fresh and simple seafood. This is a great start to a fun evening. Its fun to share a dozen oysters and a brew before hitting the town. Very cool expirence if you like oysters on the half shell. It's fun to pick them out of the live tanks. You can mix a dozen however you want or just order a couple. They have some of the more popular oysters. They also had some live scallops, crabs, Maine lobsters, clams, and gooey ducts. &#160;It's a must if you are into it. We walked there from Pikes place witch didn't take too long. I will be back. My favorite place to eat succulent freshly shucked oysters from people who know everything there is to know about oysters. It is a market but they have few small tables for you to sit and enjoy. You can also get freshly made soups (clam chowder or geoduck chowder) and wine pairing. LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I buy all of my shellfish here whenever I can. &#160;It has become a weekend ritual. &#160;They have beautiful live scallops, a great oyster selection, enormous crab and lobster, and clean clams and mussels. &#160;Someday soon I will try the geoduck, once I figure out the right way to use it.The happy hour is a pretty good deal, too. I have become a fan!!I never heard of this place until a friend suggested us getting oysters there. She's an oyster lover. And I was blown out of my mind. The setting is casual but you will get to pick whatever kind of oysters you like (there are about a dozen kinds). The staff will crack them open and serve you. I also tried the oyster stew last time and it was oh-so-delicious. Great convenient place to try a variety of Oysters. 1 star off for the price. You can do better at Eliott's oyster bay happy hour (50 cents per oyster vs $2 per oyster here). In all likelihood if you have eaten an oyster in Seattle it has probably come from their farms. &#160;Staring at a list of places they supply with their oysters, I was amazed at how many local restaurants were on the place. &#160;I came here twice in a 3 day period. &#160;I walked in the first time in the middle of the afternoon while there was some photo shoot was going on, but they were happy to help set me up with a dozen of the freshest oysters I have ever had. &#160;They have multiple tanks to showcase their seafood delights. &#160;Live crabs and lobsters against the wall of fridges. &#160;Center stage are local types of oysters, goeducks, mussels and clams in circulating water tank. &#160;This thing is mesmerizing. &#160;I got a fresh dozen of some totten virginica (an east coast species that the farm grows on the west coast) &#160;and kushi. &#160;All simply delightful with mignonette and cocktail sauce. On my second visit a few days later, the wife and I got a dungeness crab and some more oysters and some of their geoduck chowder. &#160;It was all delicious. &#160;Dave the guy shucking our oysters was the coolest host and not to mention the state's Shucking champion. &#160;SHUCK YEAH! &#160;Get here and consume as many of these delicious seafood items as possible. &#160;They have wine and beer as well. &#160;You can always grab the oysters to go as well. Finally went to the new Taylor Shellfish Farm Store on Melrose. &#160;Very clean and orderly and &#160;a nice addition to "the Hill"s" plethora of great places to eat. Great assortment of chowders and oysters. Great suggestions on wine pairings. No surprises here due to the Mega Corporate "Monopoly" that &#160;TSF has over the smaller shellfish farmers of the Pacific NorthWest. First off, I have to say, Google needs to update their maps because I was unsure as to were the store was. :(As for the store/restaurant, it is nice and clean. &#160;The staff is very helpful. &#160;The variety is a bit limited, but what is available is delicious. &#160;I highly recommend going with some friends for happy hour. Have you ever watched that Mr. Bean episode where he eats a dozen oysters and then gets violently sick? Well, I watched that episode as a kid and have been terrified to try one ever since. Well, I decided to take the plung and try my first Oyster. I'm glad that my first Oyster tasting was at Taylor Shellfish Farms. Taylor Shellfish pulls these Oysters straight out of the tank (or whatever you call it) so it was very fresh.The staff was very knowledgable and friendly. Definitely try to get there earlier in the day because when I came in at 4pm, they were very low on the geoduck chowder and ran out of the scallops. They sell shellfish. Just shellfish. No salad, no cheese, no desserts. Just shellfish, farmed an hour north of here. The oysters we ordered were amazingly tasty and incredibly fresh. The food here is so damn fresh that the folks behind us had their prawns shucked at the table ... live ... wriggling and squirming. Which was perhaps a little more than I could deal with, but point is, the food is fresh as hell. At least with oysters, there isn't a lot of wriggling and squirming. This store has great fresh shellfish available. We went in without really knowing the type of oyster we wanted, and were provided great information on what is what. If I could afford to come here every day, I would! I could never say enough good things about this place! Yum yum yum yum yum yum yum!!!!! We dropped in for a dozen oysters and two glasses of wine, the oysters were very clean, shucked just moments before being eaten. It was all very reasonably priced, and I cannot wait to come back and destroy a few dozen more! I LOVE OYSTERS!!! Ordered:- Oysters on a half shell, geoduck ceviche (w mango, pineapple, chili), dungeness crab, oyster chowder (soooo good!), Service: Was EXCELLENT!!! attentive and friendly! Price: On avg $25/pp Overall experience: A must to visit when in Seattle!!! Great quality for a great price!
EAT ALL THE THINGS!Pretty much perfect. This place is half fish shop, half cafe. There's just 3 small high tables next to the live oyster tanks and other fish packed in ice. We came here for lunch and the chef guy kept offering to cook things for us and the other couple there. I don't know how often that happens but I get the impression it was not uncommon. It was like having a personal seafood cook. What we put in our faces:- Geoduck chowder - pretty delicious- A dozen oysters - 2 kinds (of about 6 I think), fresh, high quality and amazingly cheap!- Sea perch - lightly battered, fried on the stove built into the shop counter, also excellent- A lb of mussels - steamed with a tasty broth with bread to mop up, a bit large for my liking but that's just meWe were in danger of being even more gluttonous but we had a plane to catch. I really want this store to do well. They have amazing prices for lobster and Dungeness crab, and high end restaurants around Seattle sell their oysters for twice as much as the storefront's price. We bought lobster and oysters to take home and they were both delicious.Unfortunately, the customer service here was terrible. No one was mean or impolite; everyone seemed to be trying to do a decent job. And, to be fair, the store just opened, so it may take some time for them to get their bearings. What was so disappointing about it then? 1) The guy who helped us could not pull a lobster out of the tank for the life of him, even though their claws were banded together. 2) The signs for the oysters were really unclear. After tasting them, it seems like they were all the same type, but some were labeled Pacifics and some were labeled Totten Inlet. 3) We asked for extra small oysters, but he pulled a bunch out of an unlabeled basket. I think they were the right size, but why not take the oysters out of the basket that is specifically labeled with what I asked for? 4) This is the kicker. He tried to charge us for double the lobster's weight...what?! It didn't seem malicious, more like he just couldn't remember how much it weighed. Oh yeah, the process of buying a lobster and a dozen oysters took almost 15 minutes, even though we were the only customers there. No wonder he couldn't remember how much the lobster weighed.I want an awesome seafood shop in Cap Hill, but you're going to have to do better than this to compete with Pike Place Market! omg, I don't know where to begin...I am a HUGE fan of Taylor Shellfish Farms....I just LOVE them, like a LOT!! PROS:1. &#160;The quality of the shellfish is very high.2. &#160;Price is reasonable, and yet I haven't found 1 single dead clam!3. &#160;People working there are super helpful and they are willing to answer any of my questions. CONS:none! Seriously, I cannot think of any :-) We go there once every 1-2 weeks to buy mussel, steamer clams, fresh scallops, and my absolute favorite.....oysters!! And also we are planning on asking them to have an oyster bar at our wedding next summer.If you have any question about oysters, talk to a gentleman named Bill. He made me feel extremely welcome to ask any questions about oysters, and his passion for farming high quality shellfish was almost overwhelming. &#160;(in a positive way, of course!) Review is specifically for the Dungeness Crab Cracking Demo with Jon Rowley.I walked in loving Dungeness Crab but absolutely intimated on preparing them myself. &#160;I walked out full - of both knowledge and crab!Jon walked us through the basics of how to get all the meat out of a crab. &#160;We started with a whole crab and then hands-on explored and systematically dismantled the crab to to maximize the meat with minimal carnage. We then ate our work. &#160;The class was fun and Jon's knowledge of seafood is staggering. You've probably had their shellfish if you've been to any of a number of tasty restaurants in Seattle, and now you can get the same oysters, clams, scallops, and mussels in a convenient location and at a great price. The live spot prawns were a highlight of my summer. I just bought a live crab there tonight, brought him home and boiled him (complete with traumatizing video of his little crabby claws flailing...I'm such a bad vegetarian!) and 2 dozen oysters - Olympia, which I'd never tried before, and Shigoku, a favorite. Man, shelling oysters yourself is hard, but they threw in a free oyster knife and I'm stubborn. I'm sure I'll get better with practice, and I'll have a lot of opportunity in the future to keep practicing. Because I'll be coming back here regularly.I'd like to try the chowders they have warming near the counter. Also on the counter is water and iced tea, complementary. They have a variety of sauces and condiments, cookbooks, cooking classes, and very helpful staff. I'm looking forward VERY HIGHLY to their getting a liquor license - I can't wait to spend happy hour here as often as possible! If you're a shellfish fanatic this is the place to go. &#160;Why? If you order raw oysters in a good Seattle or Eastside restaurant, or get that hot bowl of steamers, chances are pretty darn good their purveyor is Taylor Shellfish. So why not go to the source? This place is the next best thing to actually being in the water.If you want to buy great oysters in bulk like the restaurants, or just eat a dozen in the rough, I REALLY recommend taking that 80 mile trip north to the mother ship of Taylor Shellfish Farms in Bow, WA.If not, go to Cap Hill and enjoy! My boyfriend and I decided to try this place to kill time before our dinner reservations and we were pleasantly surprised. They have a pretty good selection of locally farmed oysters but there's also a small bar area - where they also serve wine.I recommend trying the Shigoku oysters with tabasco. So FRESH and the oysters go through a super organic tumbling process that gives the shell it's silky smoothness. This place is great..and yet still a work in progress, it seems. There are a variety of locally farmed oysters on display and for sale and an incredibly knowledgeable (and super friendly) staff. &#160;They're open until 10 on fri/sat and just started serving wine!There is seating for 15-20 people at tall tables, oyster and geoduck chowder (serve yourself) and various oyster swag, books, etc...They're clearly working towards a full Oyster Bar type place, but as it stands, this place rules. &#160;I bought oysters (raw), oyster stew, smoked oysters, etc... all summer. &#160;With the wine serving, I know where Friday happy hour will be this winter. Yay! This place has a wonderful selection of local oysters and other seafood at a pretty affordable price. It's not really cheap, but hey this is downtown Seattle...The geoduck chowder is definitely one of the highlights! Not overly creamy or packed with filler. Grab a dozen oysters and shuck them at home, or enjoy them right there on the spot with some wine or beer! really friendly and helpful, even for oyster noobs. clean, cheap and tasty :) Seriously amazing oysters, knowledgeable and friendly, lovely location, and sweet prices. I don't even mind not sipping a dirty martini while slurping my oysters...this place is all*about*the*shellfish. Yum. We stopped in because we saw the Melrose Market in one of our Seattle Foodie tourist type pamphlets. &#160;They had some mussels on special and they cooked them in the traditional tomato-wine-garlic broth. &#160;Despite being in a vacation rental, we were convinced we needed to buy a couple pounds and do the dish ourselves.Best mussels any of us have ever had.The staff was super helpful and the prices seemed good too. &#160;They even had geoduck!
My new favorite Thai joint, my new favorite restaurant in general -- I'm bordering on obsession over Amazing Thai. &#160;Nothing special to look at, nestled (some would say "crammed") as it is between a shitty comedy club and "The Folkstore," whatever that is, but since first trying their panang curry two weeks ago, I've considered it an option for every meal, finding an excuse to visit three more times. &#160;The phad thai is very tasty if not ground breaking, and the curries are outright delicious. &#160;Most of the lunch menu items are $6.95, and they only bump 'em up a dollar for dinner in most cases. &#160;Cheap!Plus, as many here have noted, the family that owns the place are super nice. &#160;I kind of wish they were my family. &#160;It seems like they're genuinely glad to have you in their joint, from the cold water and li'l bowl of soup that greets you upon sitting down (even if you're getting take out!), to the Andes mints you get with your check, and the gracious "Thank you so much" you hear a dozen times on your way out. &#160;It feels like you just went to someone's house for dinner.Amazing Thai is the perfect storm of inexpensive entrees, non-contrivedly nice service, and delicious spicy food. &#160;Go give them some business! &#160;If we're lucky, maybe they'll stick around a while. This place is the bomb. I don't go anywhere else after discovering this place, thanks fellow Yelpers! I like my food to be nostril flaring spicy, and this place does the trick. &#160;Maybe it is just me but the majority of Thai restaurants on the Ave are flippin weak sauce when it comes to the spice factor. My suggestion? Grow a pair and order 5 stars! :DFor the price you pay and the service, this place can't be beat. The only downside is that the space is pretty tiny, so you need to be watchful of where you sit. I love this place.Amazing food.Amazing service.Amazing Thai, indeed. Went here based on other Yelper's review and to be fair my review is based on just one dish because that's all I've tried here. I ordered a Thai Fried rice. Thinking it's pretty hard to mess up on Fried rice and the Thai's typically cook the best fried rice. I came here when they just opened for lunch. I ordered the fried rice and noticed that they were using freshly cooked steamed rice to make the fried rice. Anyone who has ever cooked fried rice knows that you can't use newly cooked steamed rice to cook fried rice, it makes it soggy. You have to use cold rice. I hoped that maybe they knew a secret to cooking fried rice with newly cooked steamed rice that maybe I didnt know about. When I got my dish it was as I had anticipated. The fried rice was soggy and mushy. The flavoring was nothing special either. I might give this place one more try in the future but now that I finally found a good Thai restaurant in Thai Palm in South Seattle on MLK, I might not want to waste my valuable stomach space on it. My favorite Thai restaurant in Seattle. Wonderful curries, great "Garlic" entree (yep, that's how it's listed on the menu -- "Garlic"), and other wonderful dishes -- all very inexpensive. Unbelievably friendly staff. Note: It's a tiny place, so I wouldn't recommend it for groups over 4 people. Service was great! &#160; Since we were the only ones in the place &#160;and were eating "linner" (we came in between lunch and dinner) we had the chance to chat with the family that runs the place. &#160;They are very nice and the service was attentive and, as a previous review stated, seemed more genuine than contrived. &#160;The food: &#160;we ordered pad thai and panang curry, 3 stars. &#160;Now I have ordered dishes elsewhere 3 stars and found the spiciness to be lacking. &#160;Not so with Amazing Thai ast their 3 stars packs some heat. &#160; The pad thai was good, although it didn't really stand out as anything to set it above the other thai joints in the area. &#160;It is made with American tastes in mind, according to the waiter (who is the son of the owner), and has ketchup instead of tamarind which is the more authentic ingredient. &#160;While not overly ketchuped (how's that for a new verb!) and still tasty, I have to say I prefer the tamarind pad thai I have had at Buddha Ruksa in west Seattle. &#160; The panang curry did not disappoint. &#160;The portions were generous and the prices reasonable, this is the kind of Thai restaurant that you hope will be successful because the family is so nice. &#160;I would definitely go here again. Love this place. The people there are so nice, and the food is supreme. They are quick and the price is right. Give this place a try and it will be your fave Thai place in the University District. Promise. OK, so I'll start with the good. &#160;The people that run this business are really really nice and the prices are good. &#160;But that's about it.I went here because of the great reviews with 4 other friends so we had a wide range of items. &#160;The food is only average at best. &#160;The phad thai is on the ketchup side of the spectrum. &#160;The basil pork is average. &#160;The spring rolls are forgettable. &#160;The crab/cream cheese wontons are average. &#160;The swimming rama is good.I had high expectations and was let down. &#160;Go here for average thai food at an affordable price. &#160;But don't go in big groups because the restaurant cannot accommodate it.My favorite Thai restaurants in the U-dist is MAY on 45th. Best Thai food in Washington, bar my wife's kitchen. This is the best blend of American palate &amp; Thai tradition I've seen. There is very little variability in food because the owner is always cooking in this "Mom &amp; Pop shop." I've gone with many different Thai people &amp; they loved it just as much as the Americans - only other place I can say that for is Bangkok Thai Kitchen in Concord, California.If you're new to Thai food (e.g. to be careful you would order Phad Thai or Fried Rice (WTF?!?)), PLEASE let the waiter Kevin order for you. Choose something with meat, something that Thai people would eat. Some of my favorites are Crying Tiger, Tom Yum soup, Pad Prik something (tell them "the deep fried fish that Jeremy loves), and of course Larb Gai.Definitely large groups are not even possible. There are ~6 seats at the dining bar &amp; 4-5 tables seating 4 each. For example, it is difficult but possible to do 6.BTW other favorites of ours are Uma Thai Cuisine - but Chef Mali is no longer there, so it dropped to a 4.5) &amp; Krua Thai - the food is the most authentic Thai you'll get in Seattle but its cold and dusty. Amazing Thai rocks! Ordered it for delivery, took about 30 minutes which isn't too bad. &#160;Really cheap, very friendly service, and the food was awesome. &#160;Mike ordered a 4 star, and he was breathing like a dragon. my girlfriend and I recently tried Amazing Thai for the first time. Thai restaurants are abundant in Seattle, and this restaurant though good does not stand out much from the rest. The delivery was very fast, under 30 minutes to deliver from the U district to our east Greenlake apartment. I tried the Pad Thai and my girlfriend tried the Cashew Chicken. We ordered them 3 stars and that level of spice is a little hotter than some of the other Thai spots 3 star ranking. The Pad Thai was ok but not exceptional, and the cashew chicken was slightly below par. We might order from them again just because they were so convenient. Though I rarely have the time to wonder off the Ave., this place is worth the walk! If you live close, this place is a GEM. The service is AMAZING. After being used to Thai Tom and Thai 65, you can really tell that these people care for you and go the extra mile to make your experience a good one. My friend and I were both served complimentary soup while we waited for our meals to arrive. When our bill came, two Andes mints were included! The place is clean, the food delightful, and the staff are the nicest people around.
HMM... where do i start. Well the food was delicious! We started out with the garlic steamed clams which was very good but the portion was really small.. that was a little disappointing. Also ordered IL Brecciarolo Rosso Picero Velenosi 03' glass of red wine. Let me tell you....it &#160;blew my mind. Im not much of a red wine drinker and it was perfect for my palate. I had the Agnolotti Mauro which was cheese filled pasta, prawns,eggplant, tomato cream to go along. &#160;I loved it!! It wasnt to much..i didnt care for the eggplant as much though and thats a little wierd cause i love eggplant. I also tried the Capelini pasta.. that was really light and filling. I recommend that if your not looking for something so heavy. Of course for desert who could turn down tiramisu!!! It was the perfect ending to my meal. The noise can get a bit frustrating..since its a chatter box in there. But it worth it for the food. The service is fantastic!! They are very helpful and attentive to your needs. Service to me always the icing on the cake... Assaggio is my favorite restaurant, Italian or otherwise - and it's not just because Mauro the owner give you hugs and kisses when you come in. &#160;The food is incredible. &#160;I've been eating there for years. &#160;Of all the delicious things there you just can't go wrong with the beef tenderloin, salmon, cooked spinach or the appetizer plate with bruscetta, grilled prawn, cooked spinach are consistently wonderful. &#160;My favorite dessert is Tartuffo. &#160;It's a round chocolate ball of gelato thats rolled in cocoa. &#160;The service is professional and very welcoming. I'm going to keep this short and sweet.... My fiance and went here for dinner last weekend.... &#160;The service was excellent. The wait staff was very attentive... the wine selection was a good (a little pricey...but there are options)... &#160;The entree was exceptionally SALTY. &#160;The ambiance o.k., it got noisier as the evening went on.. &#160;But, I'd go back, their service was impressive and there are some other items on the menu I wouldn't mind trying... But Bizarro is still my favorite. :-) We tried Assaggio for a late take-out dinner. Good food and attractive specials. One important point of feedback: the bread was stale and hard, and the restaurant could use a new recipe for it.
Headed out to Capitol Hill for the first time since we moved up to Washington and picked out a few bars to visit. This was the first stop and both the man and I were liking the ambiance. We ordered a Moscow Mule (me) and an Old Fashion (him) and shared the Mac and Cheese with Duck Fat Bread Crumbs, Apple and Watercress. My Moscow Mule was... meh, not bad but I'd definitely had much better but the Mac n Cheese was really good! I mean, duck fat bread crumbs? A total win. Like Jordan L. said, the bartenders seemed.... preoccupied and not completely attentive to when we needed more drinks, or the bill, and it wasn't busy at all. One other person at the bar. I would like to go back and give it another chance, because I feel like it could be a really great bar. I'm starting to think McCracken &amp; Tough do gastropubs and bars better than they do restaurants because I gotta hand it to Spur and Tavern Law. &#160;I found The Coterie Room, on the other hand, subpar.I've been here several times but I was holding off reviewing this place until I tried the food. I had the Amazon Local deal for $25 for $50 so I thought it would be a good chance to eat some of the food. I had the Pan Seared Trout with chickpea and carrot puree and my friend had the Pork Shoulder. &#160;I was a little hesitant about the trout since I didn't like it at The Coterie Room. &#160;This was cooked the same way but the puree was better. The fish was also topped with cilantro so it had more flavor. &#160;I've also had a number of drinks here including the Worker Bee, the Dover Tea (Earl Grey vodka, rosemary, lemon and some other flavors I don't remember), La Flora...something (St. Germain's, vodka, ginger and rhubarb) and some others I don't remember. All their drinks are awesome. They have originals and fancy classic cocktails done well. Moscow Mules are my go-to drink and the Worker Bee is a fancier version and delicious. The Dover Tea was a pleasant surprise. I am a big fan of Earl Grey and that and the rosemary flavors really came through.If you want something a little more robust and masculine, my friend is a big fan of Dirt and Diesel.One complaint is that the service can sometimes be slow. It can take a really long time to get a drink here somedays. It wasn't that bad the time we came with the food at 9:30 on a Saturday, but I've come at 11-12 on weekends before and waited a long time.The atmosphere here is great. It's small but I love the dark wood paneling thing. I like the big table in the back...the trick is getting it. I know I'm in the minority but I like this place better than Needle + Thread.As a restaurant, I would probably give this place 4 stars. There's places nearby I prefer but as a bar, 5 stars for sure. &#160;One of my favorite bars. I rarely drink cocktails and this place makes me want cocktails every day. That's saying a lot for a beer-and-wine girl such as myself. Luckily, I haven't made it to the super-secret back room yet, so I have an excuse to come back and drink more.I wish this place opened a little earlier, though, because I found myself wandering around the Hill waiting for 5 so I could go in. I know 5 isn't exactly late, but sometimes you just need to get your happy hour on a little earlier. Ya know?Anyway, back to the cocktails. I spent forever reading the drink menu because there was so much to see and I am easily fascinated. For my first drink I ordered a Moscow Mule; I've recently discovered these and had yet to actually drink a whole one (sneaking sips of a friend's drink doesn't quite cut it). And it didn't disappoint. I was going to order a second one but my friend talked me into an Old Cuban, which she'd had previously and thought was good. I decided to be adventurous and try it out even though I wasn't 100% sure about it - and it was damn good, too. I can't speak for the food, as there wasn't much that appealed to me on the menu. As another reviewer wrote, it's very "meat-inspired" and that's not my thing, plus I didn't feel like spending $5 for olives. Our server was friendly, though, even when my friend spilled her glass of water all over the floor. He probably hates us, but he didn't let it show.We left to go find dinner somewhere, but I probably could have stayed and tried new cocktails all night. Maybe next time... This place reminded me a little bit of a dark, swanky cool library...but with delicious food and tasty drinks. You MUST get the burger with pork belly. I was afraid it'll be overkill (beef &amp; pork belly whaaaa??) &#160;but this burger was omg good. The pork belly was just melt in your mouth delicious. The provolone cheese was nice touch. Yes, the $19 price tag is high but my tastebuds would certainly say its justified. I would happily order this again.Other items we got was the Mac and cheese &amp; spiced fried chicken. The Mac and cheese was flavorful, another repeat order I would get in the future. The spiced chicken was good but not as great as the burger or Mac-n-cheese. It was a little on the sweet side.I wanted to try a sweet &amp; fruity drink and the waiter recommended The Lusty Lady. I don't remember what was in it but it was perfect for me. I'm excited to come back and try the other drinks they offer (extensive list) and perhaps try the speakeasy bar above it. This place is a solid 5 star. The other night we went to Tavern Law then upstairs to Needle and Thread for drinks with a group of 4. While I can't attest to any of the food, every drink we had was perfectly made, delicious and really well balanced. No complaints all around through 3 rounds of drinks. At Needle I asked for a citrus/gin drink and they brought me one of &#160;the best citrus/gin drinks spiked with some lavender....mmmm good.I would take off a portion of a star for the bartenders letting it be known that it's the same bartenders both upstairs and downstairs- I would have preferred to think of Needle and Thread as a bigger mystery! Tavern Law reminds me of the celebration of our Speakeasy Histroy of 1919 Volstead Act and providing thirsty patrons with crafted spirits in hidden rooms and dark basements.Voted the best 25 bars in America by GQ Magazine.Still one of my favorite places to get a well crafted cocktails, fine wine and masterfully prepared food that makes my tongue dance all night long.Unassuming exterior, but walk in with bartenders and staff dress up to the nines. Large wooden bar that invites you to sit at the bar with coat/purse hangers under the bar and large comfy stools. A wall of books to give a feel of a law library. A two way mirror which can be a tv on special occasion. A vault and a telephone to another secret passage to the upstairs of Needle and Thread.Even the bathroom is very nice and clean with individual towels to wipe your hands and soap with this incredible addicting smell.Some of my favorite bartenders have left but new dedicated talented bartenders just as good replace them with the art of mixing drinks.The difference is Tavern Law has an extensive cocktail menu or make a cocktail with your liking of favorite spirit, choice of words like spicy, savory, sassy, sour and choice of bitters. If I am not in the mood of a crafted cocktail, I normally order a Old Fashioned or Mint Julep...if I am, I want a spicy, sour with fresh grapefruit juice (they squeeze fresh squeeze fruit juice), bitters and vodka.Also, TL happy hour is killer with cocktails only $7 like my favorites cocktails of Moscow Mule, Vesper (007 Bonds Drink), and Jack Rose. 10% off food. I believe Sunday is all day Happy Hour. The food is also masterfully prepared to play with your tastebuds. I like the fried chicken and smash red potatoes, pan seared trout with eggplant + squash, Foie Gras Terrine with basil huckleberry + warm toast, new pork shoulder, and my FAVORITE The Natural Beef Burger with this amazing red wine reduction onion jam, provolone melted cheese ($15) and adding a pork belly ($4). A-M-A-Z-I-N-G ! ! ! &#160;If not the best burger, one of the best burgers IMO.If you haven't visit Tavern Law to drink a couple of tasty crafted cocktail drinks or taste any of the masterful food menu, then you are missing out! I love the ambiance of Tavern Law with the lofty, library-ish feel, but sitting in a bar sipping on some classic martinis and such. &#160;I have to say I fell in love with their burger with wine soaked onions. &#160;The fried chicken that's brined for a few days was heavenly too.Thanks to some friends for introducing me to this place... So hipster. Tavern law has some of the best cocktails in Seattle with food to match. &#160;Plus, they host Needle &amp; Thread upstairs, which is tucked away like a modern speakeasy. &#160;They have a perfect old fashioned with many choices of bourbon or ryes. &#160;But prices tend to run pretty steep here, with my last cocktails running $13 a piece. &#160;It can definitely get crowded quick, so I would try coming here on a weeknight or early on a weekend night. My friend is obsessed with their fried chicken. We went here for dinner and drinks. The drinks were delish. The food was good. I got the braised pork shoulder with brussel sprouts and my friend got the fried chicken. The chicken was cooked to perfection! My dish was a little under seasoned, but non the less delicious. Dessert menu was a bit slim pickings. We had the keylime pie. it was good not great. Overall the place is a little dark and gloomy- small and food was decent. Tavern Law is so chill. So much swag. And awesome bartenders. Downside is how packed it gets on a Saturday night but what bar isn't on the hill right?My go-to drink here is the Dover toddy. It has earl grey tea and is absolutely scrumptious. I keep trying to get people to come here on Sunday nights for toddies but no one seems to want my company. Sad. As much as I appreciate swanky, gorgeous atmosphere and innovative craft cocktails, I very much balk at charging $4 for a soda water. Holy $hit, Tavern Law, is 10-20 per drink not enough for you? Do you just hate DDs? WTF.I had the Southern Belle, which was great in terms of flavor, but poor in terms of alcohol content. Maybe I'm getting to be too much of a lush, since I seem to say that a lot. I also ended up finishing my friends' drink. I've forgotten the name, but it consisted of whiskey and a very, very strong medicinal taste from the chamomile infused alcohol. Not the best thing I've ever tasted, but much more worth the price tag-- this one will knock you on your @$$.We also ordered a gin based cocktail. If I had to put a name to it, I'd say it was a corpse reviver, but not positive. My friend liked it very much. All in all, I'd give TL another shot, especially after eyeing some of those small plates offered. Came on a Monday and sat at the bar. Immediately felt at home with the bartenders' warm personalities and knowledge of liquor. &#160;They make a fine cocktail and their small menu complements this well.Needle and Thread is unfortunately closed on Mondays but they were still kind enough to show us around upstairs. Great cocktails. &#160;I really can't remember what I ordered but it was whiskey goodness. &#160;Service was solid.The food was ok. &#160;Nothing special. &#160;The mac and cheese was solid and so was my sandwich. &#160;I really wasn't here for the food, I was here for drinks.It's not cheap but the drinks are made with care. &#160;The seating is limited and they do not take reservations so arrive early and hope for the best. &#160;I would go back again if I had a few extra bucks and want to splurge on some fancy cocktails. Tavern Law is still one of the best bars in the city- hands down. Its part of Dana Tough and Brian McCracken's Seattle empire (also coterie room and spur). What this means is you'll get good service, experimental fusion food, and awesome experimental drinks. Thats pretty much their thing and we love them for it! The drink list is quite large with very little filler. Every drink I've ever had has been superb. Atmosphere is dark wood, dim lighting - perfect for a gastropub. It usually gets very very busy on the weekend so seats are hard to come by (there aren't a ton anyways). Food list is essentially a reduced version of Spur which is a reduced version of The Coterie Room, I'm not implying that the food menu at Tavern Law is a replica of Spur or Coterie Room, its not. But, they are familial in their style, preparation, and ingredients. What this does mean is, if you've enjoyed your food at Spur or Coterie Room then you'll likely enjoy the grub at Tavern Law. Well worth a visit if you're a local or visiting from out of town. Tavern Law is one of my favorite places in the city. I'm surprised I haven't written a review yet! I love coming for a cocktail or two and putting my faith in the bartender to whip up something that I will love. My favorite drink was an egg white vodka cocktail I had awhile back. Recently I had a spicy whisky drink with ginger that was refreshing and very tasty. Their burger with bacon jam is one of the best upscale burgers in Seattle. I love it! This weekend my friend and I had dinner and drinks here. I had the burger with fries and she had the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and corn. Both were excellent. The fried chicken had honey on the skin so it was a little bit sweet. Prices were on the higher end for comfort food at around $15 per plate but were well worth it, in my opinion.Tavern Law is a great place to take someone you're trying to impress. Space and seating is limited so be prepared to wait. They deserve all the recognition they have received! Great staff and wonderful mixed drinks! It can get busy so be patient and wait for a table if need be, it's worth it! AND if you're on a date, bring them here for cocktails! I can't speak to the food, but I can speak to the drinks. &#160;They are fantastic. &#160;Each one I tried was a hit.What sells it is that the drinks are very experimental, but with excellent ingredients. &#160;No filler alcohol here. &#160;The stuff I got was the stuff I'd use to make my own drinks at home... top notch rums in particular.The atmosphere may not exactly be the mellowest or homeliest, nor will the drinks be the cheapest, but let's be clear: you're here for the flavors. I have been to Tavern Law a few times and enjoyed the experience each time. &#160;I love it that I can order a drink by saying "I want something spicy with tequila in it" and be handed an amazingly delicious cocktail that perfectly fits my whim. I enjoy sitting at the bar, or close to it, to watch the bartenders' meticulous attention to detail. &#160;Also, their use of fresh fruit and zest add so much to the cocktails-- you wouldn't think it would matter much, but the fresh juice and peel gives such a luscious flavor, plus the bonus of lovely aroma. &#160;The appetizers menu is delicious. &#160;I've been here before dinner plans, so I only order small bits to nosh on to tide me over, but so far everything I have ordered has been tasty and well plated. It can get noisy when it's packed, which is often. &#160;I haven't been up to the speakeasy yet, so this review is only for the main floor bar. &#160;Also, I took away one star because of the bourbon drink a bartender made for my husband with fortified wine. Yes, we were vague when ordering (want something bourbon-y) but the cocktail did not taste very well in comparison to what we ordered previously. Will definitely be back! Okay, so maybe I'm a cheap date, but this place pours a strong drink for a very inexpensive happy hour; the interior feels like an exclusive club; and the waitstaff magically respond to every glance you send in their direction. With all that to recommend it, who cares if I'm under the table after a couple of Manhattans? Three cheers to you, Tavern Law! Drinks are strong and pretty damn perfect. The fried chicken is amazing. It better be for $14 for two pieces. I love their pork belly and their popcorn grits, but didn't see it on their menu last night. Instead they had a pork belly BLT which I didn't try. I ended up getting the pork belly on my burger. Burger was good, but pork belly was dry and nothing to rave about. For $19 I expected it to be better, but was disappointed. I remember having the mac and cheese another time and it was pretty good. I just love this place really and it is usually very busy. Quite pricey for small bites, but hey, every once in a while it's ok to spoil yourself with great drinks and food. I probably just won't order the burger again. I've been upstairs once. It is called Needle and Thread even if they share the same menu. I love the ambience upstairs. This place always make me happy. I am always excited to bring my friends here because it is more than just amazing food and drinks, it is quite an experience. To be honest, I am more of a wine and beer person than a hard liquor or cocktail person. But places like Tavern Law are slowly changing that. I really appreciate the seriousness with which the bartenders take their hand crafted cocktails here. It is apparent that it is more than an means to an end for these guys. And they are more than willing to educate or make suggestions. There are coktails that you don't find on a typical bar drink list. The freshness of the ingredients and the quality of the liquor used in the drinks is apparent. These drinks are not watered down and meant to be savored and sipped. Another 5 star review... yes they are awesome, yes they are the best drinks in Seattle and also the best drinks I have had anywhere, ever. As everyone else has said, the servers are awesome and most of them are easy on the eyes. So what do I have to add to this... a recommendation for their Rum that's what!! A Cuban recommending a rum?!! OMG it must be good!! Is it? Yes, it is, this is amazing Rum!!I am not kidding when I say the rum is amazing!! I know my rum, believe me, and theirs is the best I have had in the states! The best Rum I ever had was in a bar in Rome that served Cuban rum and overlooked the Forum... but I digress... When you get here, you ask for the stuff that is made in the Cuban style, I think it's called Milagro. Ask them to make you a drink with it, don't bother telling them what you want, these guys know better than you do, believe me. Then enjoy the drink in the best bar in Seattle. If you don't like rum or don't want to take my advice, even better... more for me. Nice bar. Good drinks/large menu. Calm environment. I just had a wonderful experience at this bar and have to share:I was searching for a unique place to have my Birthday party and a friend suggested the upstairs (private) room at this location. I contacted management and there was already a private party booked that same night, but Angela went above and beyond to let my friends and I have nearly an hour up there prior to the booked event, then had her staff take wonderful care of us downstairs for the remainder of the evening.The drinks were AMAZING (inventive, gorgeous and delicious); the atmosphere was fantastic; the food was awesome and the staff couldn't have been more attentive or friendly.I will tell everyone I know about this place! We got here right as the Tavern Law opened. Which may not have been the best time to experience this place. + The food was great, you have to try the mac and cheese. +- The cocktails were good but seemed liked they could have been better based on the other reviewers here on yelp. - The Staff seemed a preoccupied with getting the bar setup than talking with the patrons or serving great drinks. + Great speakeasy styled bar+ Small and generally quiteI plan on coming back here at a better time and revising my review. Absolutely amazing! &#160;When I came in on a Sunday evening it was relatively quiet; a few people at the wooden bar and a large party at a table off to the side celebrating. &#160;It makes me wonder how many people were upstairs at Needle and Thread. &#160;Unfortunately, I didn't know about the upstairs and I wonder how many people were hanging out in the hidden upstairs.So many interesting cocktails to choose from! &#160;Had the Meathook and the Catnip. &#160;Meathook had Old Overholt, scotch and some other ingredients I can't remember. &#160;Loved it. &#160;The Catnip is like an Aviation with St. Germain. &#160;So it's a little sweeter but I loved that one as well.Food. &#160;If I had more of an appetite I would've had the burger w/ pork belly or some mac and cheese. &#160;Instead I snacked on the Fois Gras with apricot and lemon verbena gelee on top and warm toasted bread. &#160;Melts in my mouth. &#160;Mmmmm.The bartenders were very attentive and knowledgeable. &#160;I need to show my friends what they're missing out on. &#160;And maybe sneak into Needle and Thread. This is definitely one of the better bars in Seattle. &#160;Cocktails are always fantastic. &#160;Staff is awesome and fun to talk with. &#160;The speak easy theme is tasteful and not overdone to the point where it crosses over from stylish to kitsch. &#160;Always a great crowd in this place. &#160;Plenty of other awesome places in walking distance. &#160;What's not to love?The food menu here may be small but everything on it is delicious. &#160;I personally always get the greens salad which is way better than it sounds up on the menu but I suspect most people see Mac n' Cheese (which is also delicious) up there and immediately start throwing cash at the menu.Only downside to this place is that it is often packed and it's not a really good space for standing around. &#160;Get here early if you want a guaranteed space or be prepared wait around for a while. It's a very nice bar/casual lounge. &#160;Has a more "upscale" feel to the place as inferred by the name.Very large selection of cocktails &amp; spirits &amp; very small but tasty selection of food to order that's on the menu just above the bar. &#160;I ordered the foie gras plate ($15) to go w/ my drinks &amp; that came out in a small glass terrine paired with what I believe was an apricot jelly &amp; some sort of berry (looked like blueberries?) and some butter crusty baguette slices. &#160;Delicious. &#160;Another friend ordered the fried chicken &amp; that looked quite good (I didn't personally have any) but it looked like the 2 pieces of chicken came on top of a bed of creamed corn &amp; mashed potatoes. &#160;It was promptly enjoyed by the other members of my group.The cocktails are very well made &amp; because they are well made, you will have to wait a bit as the bartenders are making sure they prepare your drinks right. &#160;Cocktails range right about 10 bucks which is to be expected. &#160;If you're looking for more of a "sophisticated" night out, Tavern Law does fit the bill. &#160;There's no "club" music playing in the background, but there is ample ambient noise from just the sheer amount of people in the place, which says great things about a place. &#160;Great drinks &amp; good "classy" tavern food to go with it. &#160;I'd definitely make a return trip there. This is another one of my favorite places to grab a classy drink in Seattle. Tavern Law is a nice, quiet place tucked away in the middle of the sometimes-chaotic Capitol Hill. It's intimate, but upbeat and unpretentious. The drink menu is extensive and innovative, as is the knowledge of the pour-staff. All of the 'tenders are extremely personable, and happy to answer your every question about what you're drinking (or happy to whip you up something that's not on the menu). And, there's a secret upstairs! Once you're in, the drinks seem even better. The aforementioned drink menu is available upstairs as well, however the bartender there specializes in making you a drink based on your tastes, no matter what they are. It's very tiny, but it just feels so fancy to be in there! Tavern Law is definitely one of my favorite bars in Seattle. &#160;I'm not a big cocktail drinker, but the specialties they have here are (mostly) all fantastic. &#160;The bartenders do a good job here with the specialties (dig the Pimm's Revisited and the Girl With The Weird Name), and old time favorites (one of the best Mint Juleps in town, and a good Old Fashioned as well!). After imbibing in many a cocktail here, last night, I finally ate here. &#160;I've had bites of other people's food in the past, but for once, I was very hungry, and willing to spend some money on their pricey food choices. &#160;The Mac N Cheese was so delicious, some of the best I've had on Capitol Hill. &#160;The burger with braised pork belly - absolute indulgence. &#160;The patty was delcious, served medium rare, and probably didn't need the pork belly, but I couldn't help it. &#160;The flavor combination was awesome! &#160; I've gone upstairs to the "speakeasy" Needle &amp; Thread once. &#160;While it does have a great atmosphere and the bartender who served me there was very good, it's not necessary to have a good time here. &#160;They do a great job wherever you choose to sit. small place, but great drinks. didn't get to go up to the little bar up top. The night we went there wasn't many people there just two groups of friends. Bar tender and wait staff are nice and make good conversation. I'm not a big cocktail drinker, most likely because I've never had a good cocktail...but Tavern Law has changed my mind! I had the Lusty Lady and La Femme, both delicious. I never thought I would use the word "delicious" to describe a cocktail. We sat at the bar so our drinks came very quickly. Decent pricing for what we received. Would definitely come again. Why did it take me so long to finally check out Tavern Law?I think I officially have a new favorite cocktail: the English Fizz aka Earl Grey gin, soda water, lemon and probably something else that I forgot about. If I could only drink one cocktail for the next year, I would choose this one.We ordered the potatoes with fondue and also the cheese and nut plate, and both were delicious. The fondue tasted like jalapeno cheddar, which I'm partial to, and the cheese plate had no goat cheese which I appreciate not receiving. Also, during happy hour, food is 20% off! Enjoyed the coziness and decor, and of course the drinks. We had heard reservations were needed but the very attentive host/bartender/bouncer found us a seat as soon as one was available. Great experience, can't wait to go again! Muttons and I are tight hip fo style. Drinks so delicious you don't know they're strong. The best. I love this place! It has such a fun-trendy vibe, the bartenders are great and can mix up a mean drink. This is a very small place, so be prepared- if you're trying to go here on Friday/Saturday it will be packed. But if you find a seat- sit down and enjoy a wonderfully mixed beverage and some food! Everything is good. I order the Moscow Mule (but with tequila) and it is very fresh, light and refreshing!Food to consider ordering:Burger- so gooood. This is similar to Spur (red onion jam, good cheese, homemade bun) BUT here is the real kicker- you have the option to add Pork Belly. yes, yes you heard right- PORK BELLY.Fried Chicken &amp; Grits.. Grits are perfect, chicken is crisp and juicyPotato Skins- comes with homemade habanero cheese sauce (if this wasn't a kinda fancy place I would have licked the bowl). Step into the 1930s! Everything from the outfits on employees to the books on the shelves ooze 1930s. I came here because my date took me out on our first date here. This is a really good spot for a first date, it's romantic and dim lit, but it's not a full on candlelit dinner. You can just start off with a drink or two, and if you two feel like spending more time together you can order more food and drinks.We were lucky enough to also visit the speakeasy room upstairs because the waitress came by to tell us someone just cancelled their reservation. It's even more romantic upstairs, slow jazzy music and darker.I don't remember what drinks we got (we each had 3-4), pork cheeks and fried chicken. The fried chicken is definitely a winner! Super tender meat but not greasy at all. It is on the slightly more expensive side though, just fyi. Expect to spend at least 50 for two people if you each want at least two drinks (avg $10/ea) and food (starts@$10-12) A great place to hang out if you like an intimate, cozy, and sexy setting. The lights are dim with an interesting interior. I felt like I was in a bar that was inside of a library. It was very small but I guess that's what gives it that intimate vibe. This is a great place to visit if you appreciate the art of mixology. Their menu has an elaborate selection of cocktails. It was trying different recipes. The customer service was good, as soon as we walked in there was always someone asking if we have been helped. So I finally made it into Tavern Law. Im always a bit skeptical of places with rock star reviews, but I tell you, Tavern Law is the real deal. &#160;The food, drinks, and super friendly bartenders made my night memorable. I cant wait to return. Ok, Tavern Law has received many reviews, but I had to write one.I love this place. &#160;I'm always intrigued by these cocktail bars, just because they're usually low key and not too loud. Additionally, I appreciate it how it can be intimate and you can be on a date or with a small group of friends.I liked the drink selection and by all means I'm not a cocktail snob (still getting into it, I guess), I appreciated our server helping me select a drink I would like. &#160;This isn't the place to order red bull and vodka. &#160;They take their cocktails seriously. The food looked tasty as well, but we just stuck to the drinks.Awesome place and if I'm back in Seattle, I'd return. I like this place. &#160;It's very nice. &#160;However, the delicious fried chicken with bits of maple goodness on it make me speechless! &#160;Soooo good! &#160;Yes, the drinks were tasty, but I dream about this chicken experience and I hope that it will always be on their menu! how can you not love a place where they make delicious drinks, and their fried chicken with mashed potatoes would make any bad day better? just saying. I love this place and would recommend it to anyone! One bad thing, the waitress's are soooo capitol hill, and that in itself ruins my 12 dollar drink. yup, said it........ if you can get a male server or grab a seat at the bar top, i'd totally recommend that!!!! oh yes, don't think you'll get a table on friday/sat night by just walking in. oh btw if you want to reserve needle and thread upstairs, do that farrrrrrr in advance!! it's cool up there Cocktails and small bites and women in small dresses... these are a few of my favorite things...Much like Needle and Thread (for reasons unknown), the bartending skills demonstrated here are off the charts. &#160;Again, I stress, don't order, just trust that you will be made happy with a little faith. &#160;To the person responsible for adding duck fat bread crumbs to macaroni and cheese... A medal... or cookie... you choose.To the person responsible for force-feeding a duck or goose in order to make his/her liver extra-delicious... I have mixed feelings. &#160;You're a jerk, but thank you. Top Notch cocktails. They really know what they're doing here. Every seat at the bar was taken yet the bartender was attentive, professional and made exceptional, fresh drinks. Didn't eat but did order a $5 small bowl of mixed nuts which I thought was a little steep but oh well.definitely a place I would return to. even though the place was packed the service was great! we went on Friday of pride weekend and could not have picked a better place. the food delicious and everyone is so excited to help you :-) Very cool spot. Usually i hate all law/lawyer related themes, but this place is what I imagine a corner of the Oxford University LIbrary to feel like if you added a full bar, magic phone, and yuppies. Great little space, get there early for a seat to people watch. Pick up the phone on the wall and see what happens and expect to pay a little extra even for capitol hill. Worth it for a drink or two, but don't expect to rage here all night. It's funny, the same disdain I have for TL's upstairs lounge definitely does not extend to the downstairs area. This is mostly because I adjust my expectations (accordingly) and have honestly never had a bad drink served to me here (which is more than I can say for N&amp;T upstairs, sadly ...)Although I recognize that the talent is the same and rotates between upstairs and downstairs, the primary and most important difference is that at Tavern Law, you generally order off of the menu. That said, the bartenders are completely competent at crafting all of the house cocktails. I also don't think anyone's ever been blatantly rude to me downstairs (again, not something I can say about upstairs) and you really can't gripe much during their happy hour, amiright?Since I am not a meat eater, I haven't really tried anything off of their vittles menu (aside from sneaking a french fry from a friend now and then), but everyone i've ever hung out with here seems more than satisfied with what they usually order.Basically, this is a reliable and solid choice if you're in the neighborhood. Are there a couple of other places I'd rather go? Yes, but I certainly wouldn't turn down an invite here either. We stumbled on this place after an unsuccessful attempt to eat at a couple of other Capitol Hill hot spots. I'm glad we did. We found a cozy place with distinguished interior, attractive waiters with polished appearance, and a small but great menu of options. First, the drink menu. Amazing. The Cuban was among the 2-3 best drinks I've ever had. The number of cocktail options with vodka, rum, and bourbons was fantastic.Secondly, the menu. I don't remember much beyond the burger because it was so darn good. Perfectly grilled just to my liking -- and yes, it was charcoal grilled, as all burgers should be -- and topped with grilled onions. Best of all, the fries. OMG. The fries. Some of the best ever--small, thin and crunchy with salt.I highly recommend for a drink and burger, and maybe more. They were doing a lot of things right. First impressions of an experience say a lot, and mine of Tavern Law all jived with what I adore in a bar - comfortable, classy, sexy and still relaxed. &#160;The lovely and dark space, with a background of soulful beats and a cocktail list from here to eternity, made getting to know a new friend easy here. &#160;If the La Femme Flora (my choice of drink) is any indication of the quality of the food served here, then it's a no brainer that I'm returning to have a meal. &#160;It was exquisitely crafted, delivering just the perfect combo of warm, fruity and floral that I was craving. &#160;The sharply dressed bartenders who stop by just to chat is a sweet touch, too. &#160;It won't be long before I return. went here with a group of friends on a saturday night .. parking as always is challenging in capitol hill but we found a spot right outside on the street - what a way to start the night !!! when we walked in, the space was buzzing and there was hardly any room to make ourselves comfortable .. nevertheless we were not going to pass on cocktails so we grabbed a menu and started contemplating on our choices through the extensive menu .. We eventually found some bar stools and it was probably the best seat in the house to watch the bartender do his thing .. the guy was working like nuts and I am really surprised that he knew all the cocktails at the back of his head .. We had some basil gin concoction that was by far the favorite .. We also ordered a side of skinny fries -- they are so heavenly when you hit that happy state of mind !!! we just couldn't stop eating them .. They also have some tropical cocktails which actually are a different spin on what you would normally expect which really blows you away .. when we stepped out we knew we were not going too far which was a relief :) definitely one of my new favorite spots in town .. Solid food, good drinks and very friendly &amp; helpful service. Definitely would come back Decent place although the food is a bit pricey for me. I had a burger ($15) that was paired with an Old Rasputin beer ($6). I slammed both after (coincidentally) a post Yelp event. The server was probably annoyed at the fact that I came in with my face paint still on, but whatever. I could see TL as a nice place to take a date, as it has a slightly refined atmosphere with out being too pretentious and the food and drink are unique. Stopped here for a drink before continuing upstairs to Needle &amp; Thread. &#160;The Old Cuban is phenomenal. &#160;Their bartenders clearly have a refined talent and know exactly what they're doing. &#160;The food sounded interesting, but was too pricey for my liking. &#160;A tiny bowl of olives for $5? &#160;No thanks. &#160;I'd rather exclusively drink here. Great Fried Chicken, only downside to this place is the freezing entry way. &#160;There's a cool bar upstairs, very alluring thing to experience, very hip entry especially for a capitol hill spot. Meh. &#160;This place has been headed steadily downhill. We went here for drinks and a few appys two months ago on a "mommy and dadddy night out" and LOVE the mixologist - we told him flavors we like and he made us some amazing creations. It is a very cool atmosphere and yet not too stuffy. Cant wait to go back! Pretty good if you want some quality cocktails. The staff aren't particularly friendly or helpful. I would definitely recommend getting a reservation to Needle and Thread upstairs instead. Came here one night for a few drinks with some friends. Probably about 3.5 stars. I didn't have any food, but the drinks were good, if not a little on the more expensive side. The bf just had a few beers and I had this mojito-ish drink that was pretty yummy. The service was friendly, the bar trendy, and very hipster (wearing little hats and overalls). Overall, good experience but nothing to get super excited about. We were hoping to go upstairs but apparently weren't special enough that night or something :) Can't comment on the food as we came after dinner, but the food sounded pretty good (albeit expensive). The cocktail menu is huge but I narrowed it pretty quickly...was stuck between two drinks and told the server to surprise me (coincidence that he chose the more expensive one?!). Really liked my drink and the sips of my friends that I tried...mine had chai vodka and I forget what else....Overall good atmosphere (pretty happening for a Tuesday night!) with a unique cocktail menu! I'm torn on this place.1st off, the cocktails are great. The bar staff really knows how to create an amazing flavor profile and their custom drinks really back that up. Secondly, the food is well done. Mac and cheese was great as were the other small dishes that were shared. The problem I had was the waitstaff. We were a table of 3 with half the bar filled and it took us forever to get our food and drinks - 1 of which was wrong. Someone from the table finally went to the bar to personally order follow-up cocktails because the waitstaff disappeared for 20+ minutes. When we finally left, &#160;we needed to pay with 2 credit cards - 2/3 on one card, a 1/3 on another. Waiter put the wrong amount on the wrong card. Poorly trained waitstaff totally overshadowed the experience. I'm hoping I have a better experience in the future, but I'm not jumping up and down to wait. The huge bar menu is filled with entertaining drink names that are fun to read through:) &#160;I tried the Earl Gray tea drink and it was pretty good. &#160; I felt like the food was a bit pricey for bar food. &#160;I shared the mac &amp; cheese, burger, and fried chicken with my fiance. &#160;My fiance's favorite dish was the mac &amp; cheese. &#160;It is very unique with the watercress, apple, and duck fat bread crumbs. &#160;It had a good amount of sauce:) &#160;It is more of a creamy type sauce over cheesy. &#160;My favorite was the burger; however, it was on the small size. &#160;My fiance thought he would have preferred the burger with grilled onions instead of the red wine onion jam, but I thought the jam was a nice touch. &#160;The fries were way to salty for me. &#160; I thought it was amusing that they do not have ketchup. &#160;When you ask for it, they offer you another sauce instead. &#160;In someway I give them props because they are the first place I have ever been to in Seattle that serves burgers and/or fries and does not serve ketchup. &#160;However, I think it is inconsiderate to the customer that likes ketchup with their fries and/or burger. &#160;If you are paying $15 (19 if with pig belly) for a burger, you should be able to get some ketchup if you would like some! &#160; I think it would be amusing if someone brought their own ketchup:) &#160;The fried chicken was okay, the coleslaw it comes with sauce was a bit overpowering, but the mashed potatoes were delicious. Sadly, we did not get to see the second floor because it was closed for a private event. Popped into Tavern Law this rainy Sunday evening for a cocktail. Loved the space, loved the mixologist, loved the drinks, which were carefully crafted and made with love. A bit on the expensive side, so it shall be where we return for an extra-special night out. But we will be back, and it has definitely earned a coveted spot on our personal "Best of Seattle" list! Awesome vibe.... Books, leather, wood, secret safe door, great spirit selection I have been here many times, and have finally gotten around to posting a review.One of my favorite bars in Seattle, hands-down.Why?- Cool atmosphere; hipster without being ridiculous.- F*ckawesome drinks. &#160;When you order off-menu and ask for a Corpse Reviver #2, and the waitperson doesn't blink an eye, you know you are somewhere that takes its spirits seriously.- Some bars have great drinks and mediocre food. &#160;Or great food and mediocre drinks. &#160;This place has the best of both. &#160;The fried chicken is heavenly, as is the burger+fries. &#160;It's bar food, so don't expect a foie gras terrine. &#160;But...it's bar food taken up to the next level, with top ingredients and flavor.Still need to make it up to the reservations-only speakeasy upstairs, Needle &amp; Thread... This place is hard to beat in nearly every regard. The atmosphere is versatile and sophisticated, making it great for business chat, catching up with friends, or date night. They're easily in the top three bars for Seattle in that not only can they make perfect drinks, but they're also ready and willing to discuss the origins of a given drink, potential alternatives, and tips/tricks used to make it yourself. And the food? It's this simple: they make the best burger in Seattle. You know how most burgers are only good for those few bites on the inside, where all of the ingredients are uniformly distributed? That happens with every single bite of this burger, featuring red wine onion jam and provolone (and pork belly, if you'd like). Grab a side of aioli for your fries and you're set. Great Drinks and surprisingly great food. I was waiting to go to Needle and Thread (call easy make reservations for that) and actually ended up hitting this place after leaving Needle and Thread. Stuck around and ate and was treated to an awesome short rib burger. Highly recommend this place. I don't drink, so this is not a review on the drinks, but rather a review of the delicious food!My husband and I, along with another couple have decided to make a list of restaurants to try in Seattle to make sure we don't miss all the amazing places while we live here.Tavern Law was on the list. &#160;We walked in without a reservation on a Friday night (around 7:30pm) and were seated right away. &#160;We decided to order 1 of almost everything on the menu and split them between the 4 of us. &#160;We got everything except the salad and desserts, it is a pretty small menu. &#160;EVERYTHING was superb! &#160;We all left raving about the amazing food. &#160;We got non-alcoholic drinks as well and it turned about to be about $40 per person.I highly recommend this place for a tasty dinner. A little bit of London located on bustling 12th Ave. in Capitol Hill. &#160;When you enter it's almost like a Harry Potter set with ornate bookshelves filled with old law books. I love the layout of the place, the high ceilings, the kitchen tucked away behind the bar, the seating that curls around the room. &#160;The law books are old "federal reporter" volumes that lend a dignified air to the place. &#160;Where's Rumpole on the Bailey? &#160; Oh, you have to use the phone to see him, he's upstairs. &#160;Request an appointment. The phone.....like a clue in a dungeon and dragons game....why is that old rotary phone on the wall?? &#160;Why do people keep staring at it, using it, shaking their heads and walking away deflated, or shrieking with glee and then disappearing? &#160;Why is that old vault door there....what, it's another bar, another room...really another dimension. &#160;When you go upstairs the drinks are a little stronger, the food a little tastier, the bartenders a little cooler, and girls dresses a little tighter! &#160;Get upstairs by hook or by crook. It's like mental MSG going to the "Needle &amp; Thread" section of Tavern Law and worth it! &#160;Other Yelpers have covered the great drinks and tasty food, IMO one should also experience the game of Tavern Law, it's "afoot". Great drinks, loved the secret door to the hidden bar upstairs. Cute bar! &#160;Good drinks. &#160;I'm giving it 4 stars because the staff were not too friendly and a little condescending. &#160;A couple of my friends joined up with a group of us and decided not to get drinks. &#160;Our waiter made them feel awkward when they requested only water, and another waitress came and asked us about drinks in such a way that we felt that we should leave if we didn't order more. &#160;So good drinks, but not impressed with the staff. Been here a couple of times and the food and drinks were excellent both times. &#160;The burger with pork belly was amazing and the fried chicken was delicious as well. &#160;The cocktails I've tried here were all very good too. I have heard so much about this place and finally made it. &#160;The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because of the service, otherwise it would be a 5. &#160;I do secret shopping and its good thing I wasn't doing a shop for this place or else it would have received an F for service. &#160;We arrived around 6 15 and sat at the bar. &#160;We were greeted by a friendly person originally. &#160;Then Monica asked if we knew what we wanted, and that is when it all went down hill. &#160;Apparently she is a fabulous mixologist but someone who is in the service industry needs to help her pull her head out of her ass. &#160;She had major attitude from the get go. &#160;We were asking basic questions about the drinks and you could tell by her facial expressions that we irritated the crap out of her. &#160;She had no warmth and no smile of any kind. &#160;She never offered any suggestions or help even though we said we had never been in before. &#160;You would think that someone who makes a living from tips would have learned this a long time ago. &#160; If she worked for me, I would have fired her. &#160; We were enjoying the drinks and the food but her terrible demeanor is the only reason we left. &#160;We took our money elsewhere .Having said that, we ate the froie gras with toast. &#160; It was absolutely amazing and the drinks also were great. &#160;We will be back but will make sure we have a different server.
Drinks: &#160;Very, very good. &#160;Food: &#160;Good, not greatAtmosphere: &#160;Pretty niceVibe: &#160;Pretentious; but I'm an old Capitol Hill fart, not an scenester so maybe it's me.Service: &#160;Adequate, not particularly good or friendlyThe whole speakeasy thing is just stupid - I hope this trend ends soon. I had to redo this since they got written up a one of the best bars in America. &#160;The place is always packed with Yuppies now. &#160;I know it's not the bar's fault for being awesome, but it was a stripey button-down shirts and spiked heels meat market on a Friday night. &#160;Hey foodies: don't go on the weekends. One of my favorite Manhattans in town (tied with Still Liquor). All the bartenders know what they're doing - tell them what you like, and they can improvise from there. Or go with your standards and they'll do you right. The food is generally excellent. The fried chicken is not for the squeamish - it looks like they undercook it a bit. But I've had it, and I haven't been ill, so I guess they got that right too. Go early or go late - this place gets way crowded, way fast. Tasty Moscow Mule and a traditional whisky sour with egg white in it - yum!! Nice decor and theme, too. I really like that the cocktails have the year of their invention listed next to them on the menu - cool! Fancy cocktails always have amazed me, but usually just in the "WTF-Expensive!" way. However, there was something intriguing about all the different kinds of libations available here. I might be behind the times, but put an egg in my martini? Well, I did miss breakfast. All in all, I enjoyed all the drinks I tried (it was a big group of us) and wouldn't mind copping-a-squat some evening to try more. But I'll make sure that I've got my pretty-pennies to pay for the bill. Tavern Law's gotta have the best bartenders in town! I never got to the menu card for drinks because I so enjoyed the drinks the bartender made up for me! On top of that, the decor is elegant and relaxed at the same time, making me want to spend time there. Food-wise, I only tasted the fingerling potatoes (but the foie gras and the salad looked appetizing), and they were alright, but nothing to faint over, especially having just been food feasting at Quinn's a week earlier. But the foie gras and the salad looked appetizing. I'll definitely be back! My favorite place to begin and/or end an evening...Every time I have been here, I've been treated well &amp; felt welcome. Enjoy! This isn't going to be one of those "how have I never reviewed this place yet" sort of reviews.The truth is I've held back because I still haven't eaten here, it seems my consumption of consumables here falls more along the lines of spirits. With that said, this isn't your average pub.What I love the most about this bar is their attention to detail and dedication to quality drinks. I'm usually a "double Kettel One on the rocks" kinda guy at most bars, mostly because how can you mess that up right (see my AZUL review to find out how). Anyway, here at Tavern Law I can be confident that the bartender knows his stuff. The proof is in the pudding, I have never had a bad drink here, and hands down this bar has THE best Floradora in the city (don't know what it is? try it!). The use of fresh squeezed juices, house made syrups and tinctures, coupled with brilliantly executed traditional techniques, makes for an amazing night out at the bar.As far as I am concerned, I don't even NEED to try the food here yet to write my review (thought I most likely will). The drinks, the bartenders, and the impeccable service from the super friendly staff make up a super solid 5 star establishment.5 gin-limejuice-raspberrysyrup-gingerale-limewedge stars out of 5 This place is really cool to go with one or two other people. &#160;I like the vibe and the athmosphere. &#160;I didn't order any food for myself, but I did try bites of my friend's food and it was really good. &#160;The only problem is groups. &#160;The place is small. &#160;I made the mistake of having my birthday party there, and there were one or two other birthday parties going on at the same time.. There were so many people crammed into a little space, it was hard to get service, everyone was standing around trying to get into the secret bar upstairs. &#160;Just too many people!!! &#160;I would definitely go back on a weeknight, with no more than 2 other people. &#160;Their drinks are great, and the food is great. &#160;Just don't have a party there. &#160;Cool place.I thought I hated foie gras, but I tried some here and it was delicious! &#160;Though there isn't a large menu, they certainly have some interesting choices, and unusual mixed drinks selections. We came here for drinks. They were quite good, but we not were not blown away by any means. I was a little disappointed in the use of less-than-premium alcohols (at the very least they could use smirnoff as the most basic vodka, but they take it much lower than that). I am curious to check out upstairs though. Some other day I swung by randomly at night to see what it's about. I wasn't too wow'd by it, unfortunately. Minus the deliciously moist burger (the food), the experience was okay. Even their mint julep... ehhh. I'm used to those more like mojitos but this was like just alcohol at the bottom of a numbing-freezing silver cup, a crushed ice sphere "topping" it and the straw &amp; mint poking out.I haven't asked if they can do a Singapore Sling, yet. don't get me wrong.. this might be my 2nd favorite bar in the city. &#160;However, I still haven't gone upstairs, it's pricey, and always crowded. &#160;Great spot to grab drinks.. just tell em what you feel like. &#160;Never tried dinner here tho. &#160;Love this place. &#160;maybe i'll edit my review after I get up there. This is my favorite classy bar on capitol hill, and pretty much in Seattle as I almost live on 12th and pike/pine. ( and will be moving to a few blocks away shortly ). 1. The cocktails are amazing, creative, interesting, and so many to try downstairs I almost would want to go back on a daily basis but that would likely turn me into an alcoholic. 2. The food is unpretentious but upscale- get the burger, its my favorite burger pretty much.....ever. 3. The upstairs bar is by far the best thing of everything. the fact that they make it up on the fly based on the interaction with you and trust me, every drink i have had up there was beyond superb-but whats even better is the atomosphere, the fact that they dont have blaring music, and they limit the number of people who can come up there, so it remains quiet, and enjoyable. This a place to take a date, or a hot non date. This is probably one of my favorite places to get drinks in Cap Hill. They have wide selection of specialty cocktails that are made just right - not too sweet, with all types of liquors. It is a smaller place, so can be hard to get a seat, but love the cozy feeling on a cold Seattle evening - reminds me of some of my favorite NY speakeasies! Amazing cocktails. The end. PS: The barmen at this Capitol Hill oasis are talented, personable, and know how to run a bar. They offer up a huge selection of craft cocktails, tropicals and similar paired up with a delicious gastropub menu with the likes of foie gras, pork belly and similar on the sheets. No matter when you stop in to Tavern law - be it with the professional drinkers in the early evening hours or during amateur hour at prime time on a Friday night, the service and quality of hand-crafted cocktails will be top notch. And if you prefer straight booze, the selection of spirits is deep.PPS: The best time to chill at Tavern is not, as I learned on a recent visit, at 10:30pm on a Friday. It's packed with a huge, loud crowd... most of whom don't seem to care that much about what they're drinking. No, the best time seems to be either evening or an off weeknight. Then you can sit at the bar and have the bartender make you something special (as if the offerings on the printed cocktail menu aren't special). But even amidst the chaos of the 10:30 crowd, our cocktologist was able to mix us up some bartender's choice drinks that were insanely well-balanced and tasty. PPPS: This is seriously one of the best cocktail bars I've been to in the PacNW. Haven't had the drinks, only the food. &#160;Solid food and while I'm much more partial foie gras a la lobe style, I didn't think their mousse-style version (foie gras terrine) was very compelling either. &#160;I've had the burger and chicken here (different occasions) which are solid as well. &#160;Service is always good and consistent - like their style.Haven't had their drinks but will come back and try. Drinks took awhile, but these liquors were rhythmically put together to form a delicious masterpiece. &#160;I still prefer the other hip speakeasy on the hill known as Knee High Stocking.Ordered some desert that took almost a half hour. &#160;Where they freezing the ice cream? &#160;Where they baking the chocolate jello thing? &#160;Who knows, who cares. &#160;One of the servers didn't even know what was on the desert. &#160;Service was good enough, we had a laugh with the other Vietnamese waiter.One thing that did intrigue me was their door with a phone. &#160;People would slowly go in there groups at a time. &#160;Pick up the phone. &#160;Mumble some crap on the phone and someone would open the door. &#160;Apparently it's another speakeasy. &#160;A speakeasy within a speakeasy? Ok... &#160;If you share the same kitchen and make the same drinks in both areas, yet you as the patron, prefer to go up stairs to the 20 seated attic, then you must be looking for exclusivity. &#160;Could care less. &#160;Long story short: Enjoyed the drinks, but not enough to come back. Intimate bar with French 75s on special. I'm sure they can do more, but this was all I needed for a fun evening with colleagues. Gulp, gulp! Fantastic, bitters-orriented cocktails and solid gastropub fare. Tough to get a spot, so arrive early and stay late.*If so adventurous, tell the bartender your favorite liquor and let him whip-up some non-menue concoction up for you--more than likely you will not be disappointed. We went in around 9pm after the Capitol Hill Block party. There were about 4 people there until the place started filling up around 10pm. The d&#233;cor reminds me of a law library, but it was very comfortable and clean. The space is small with a "secret" bar upstairs with limited seating. The bartender said they fit up to about 300 people on a weekend night. It looks like there's seating for about 40 people. The menu has about 10 small plate items around the $10-$15 range. The extensive drink menu had mainly cocktails with a small list of wine and beer. Happy hour prices were $7 a drink with regular prices being around the $9-$12 range. The lighting was dim with candles at every table. There were benches and chairs with leather seats. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience with very good drinks. I enjoyed this place even though as the designated driver I stuck to non-alcoholic things. The mixologists are fun to watch and affable.Washrooms are pathetic - two private ones for the whole place and one was out of order.Cramped, but nice atmosphere. First off I'd like to say that this a review for the drinks only as I didn't have the opportunity to try the food. I came here on a Saturday night after dinner and it was awesome. The bartenders definitely know what they are doing here. Just describe to them what you feel like drinking or what your mood is and BOOM! drink in yo' hand. The prices were a little steep for me, but I would say well worth it. I don't think there was one drink that I didn't like. I'll be back to try more. Tavern Law was a lot of fun for me when it opened, but since then it has gradually lost some of its luster in my book. Maybe the crowd has changed and that's colored my experiences, but I remember having a lot more contact and connection with the staff. Lately it seems like there is more of a focus on efficiently getting orders out. I understand this is good for turnover and keeping thirsty patrons happy, but I prefer to take my time and don't mind if the bartender does too. Although it seemed fun in the past, at this point the decor and formal costumes worn by the staff seems a little Disney, a little staged. I guess in some ways that pretense adds to the charm and mystery of the place, but I like places that keep it real and don't let a theme get in the way of the human connections in a place. My favorite cocktail bar in Seattle. &#160;They serve very sophisticated cocktails and pay attention to every little detail. &#160;My go-to drink is heart burn but all drinks that I tried, I loved all of them. &#160;Make sure to go there early like before 8pm. &#160;Otherwise it would be completely packed. &#160;If you can, make a reservation for the secret second floor. &#160;You will be surprised by their cute little space upstairs. The food is seriously delicious. The upstairs is seriously awesome. But the service upstairs SERIOUSLY sucks. We made a reservation for a friend's birthday upstairs. When we called on the little phone downstairs to see if we could come up they said they were running a little behind and it would be a few minutes. No big deal. 30 minutes after our reservation they let us come up, but nobody came by to give us menus or offer a drink for another 30 minutes. We had a schedule and plans for the rest of the evening, so we asked for food, which came as a big surprise to our server (?). The food was really good but came at all different times, with a side of bad attitude. They also pride themselves on their cocktails. I asked for a "vodka surprise" thinking their ever-so-skilled craft bartenders could make me something worth marveling over. I was given a cosmo. Woopdie doo. The rest of my friends drinks either tasted like licorice, or were heavy handed in egg white froth and bitters. Also, the drinks were super expensive.The food was great, but boy were we thrilled to leave. Umm... the fried chicken here was AMAZING... Seriously, it was probably the best I've ever had. They definitely poured a little honey over the chicken which made it super bomb. I'm going to start doing that from now on. And the mashed potatoes were so smooth and tasty. No idea how many calories were in that meal but it was so worth it.I thought the drinks were OK. I ordered the signature drink which was the first on the happy hour menu and it was pretty tiny and tasted ordinary to me. I guess I have to try the other cocktails but they're so pricey I'm not sure if I'd even want to spend that much during happy hour! Well drinks are $4 during happy hour which was decent.I'd be down to come back and try the food and check out the upstairs' Needle and Thread, other than that, I'd have to be really intoxicated and generous to myself to spend more money for fancy drinks. Honestly, I have been confusing this bar with the newly opened Tyler Florence restaurant in San Francisco. I know I'm such a dork. But this place is awesome. The small plates are delicious. We had the duck fat Mac and cheese and the oxtail gnocchi. The duck fat Mac and cheese was greater than I had expected. It was like eating morsels of duck with Mac and cheese only it's imaginary duck. That's how flavorful this dish was. It was accompanied and adorned with some greens and a thinly sliced granny apple slaw. This complimented the dish really well. The oxtail gnocchi was also pretty good. The oxtail was simmered with lovely spices to a perfect tenderness. However, the gnocchi seemed a bit overlooked in my opinion. I like my gnocchi to taste like pillows of velvet in my mouth. Unfortunately, the gnocchi was a dry and a bit crunchy even with the oxtail sauce. The drinks are off the hook. All of the concoctions are masterfully creative and strong. Nothing tasted like juice. The whole place is very crowded and loud. There is so much going on that one can be distracted. I mean a girl at the table next to us was literally in our conversation just because I mentioned a scene from the tv show "New Girl". It was funny because she was excited as I was about the scene I had described to my companions. I love the decor with the books and such. It made me think that tavern law was opened just for the Seattle U law students just a block away. The service is impeccable for such a busy place. This is definitely a place to return to if I'm willing to wait for a table with friends. This is a pretty cool place. Cool mixologists for sure and they give you exactly what you wanted! Only thing is, its pretty expensive. They are great drinks but I only find myself ordering one....if there is someone else with you, it gets really pricey. Just 2 drinks nearly comes out to $40. Their macaroni is AWESOME. Again, its $13 mac, and its tiny...but so delicious! It gets crowded but it comes in waves. I will be back again, just after I get paid! The food was stellar. &#160;My party and I tried almost every major entree on the menu, except for the fried chicken (which was out). &#160;The burger with the pork belly was amazing, though a little overcooked. &#160;The mac &amp; cheese was excellent and creamy. &#160;The fried trout with risotto was delicious. &#160;The drinks were excellent, though there's some room for improvement. &#160;The mixed drinks the rest of my party had were better than mine (but I ordered an old-fashioned cocktail off-menu). &#160;I'd go back here anytime. Food was excellent. &#160;Limited Menu, but its all about the drinks. If you are in the mood for something unique and totally out of the norm, you can find it at Tavern Law! The drinks are unlike anything you will find anywhere in Seattle. its an old speakeasy that really plays the part. Go off the menu.. tell the bartender what you like and he will not disappoint you!!Pssstt... also ask the bartender about the secret vault door.. &#160;;) (Needle &amp; Thread and Tavern Law are listed separately so I reviewed them separately. I gave N &amp; T a much lower rating.) I had read many great reviews on the drinks and food as well as the ambiance at Tavern Law so I decided to check it out and drag my husband along for the ride. I was not disappointed (at least with Tavern Law...) There is a bartender there who introduced himself as Magic who makes a lovely Ober Park Fizz. He was also very patient and answered my husband's questions on what Sazerac is and he even let us taste the perfect Rye to use and then discussed the undertones and flavors in the Rye that make it good to use in the drink. Side Note: My husband and I are in a weird transition period from late 20's to early 30's where we have children and our friends do not so they still lead the "party hard" lifestyle that we are no longer interested in. Hell, we never were. I have been trying to find new places to go without ending up either in a group of newly 21 year olds in some club scene or with people my parents age. This place totally fits that bill! There were people of all ages here but no one cared and it was really pleasant. There was one guy who had to many drinks but thankfully he left and that wasn't the norm. I visited Tavern Law for the first time a few weeks ago. I'd heard so many good things about the bartenders and drinks that I may have set my expectations a bit too high. Tavern Law exceeded those expectations on every level.It was a Sunday night, so the bar wasn't packed and everyone who worked there seemed to be in a great mood. The bartender (I wish I could remember his name!!) was absolutely wonderful and helped me find something I liked while trying something different. I felt very taken care of and I loved the atmosphere. The drinks are on the pricer side, but are well worth it considering the effort and quality of product that goes into crafting their cocktails.Will definitely be back! I was at Tavern Law on a Sunday evening. &#160;The tables were empty but the bar around half full. &#160;I had two drinks: Oaxacan something and and Old Cuban. &#160;Both were excellent, though the pours were a little small.Tavern Law is pretty darn good. &#160;The one shortcoming was, though the bartender mixed a good drink, he didn't add a lot to the experience. &#160;In my opinion, a top-notch bartender provides also provides conversation and brings the crowd together. &#160;The guys at Bathtub Gin are fantastic at that; I've ended up with three new friends every time I've gone there. &#160;I won't hold it too much against Tavern Law because it was a slow night, but that is the difference between four and five stars. Loved this place. The perfect bar; great cocktails, cool atmosphere, awesome late-night food menu! We went around 11pm on a weeknight and got a salad, mac n' cheese, and truffle fries. The salad and mac n' cheese were bomb. I would be a regular here if I lived Seattle! The crowd seemed cool too; like hipsters who look like young lawyers (but are cooler than that) :) I've never had a cocktail here that was less than amazing.That being said, many of the times I've tried to come here, it's been too crowded. Even the few times I did manage to get a seat, I've gotten crashed into by buzzed and bewigged barhoppers trying to get into Needle &amp; Thread (the "secret" bar upstairs). The only time this didn't happen was when I sat outside.If you come here, prepare to either: stand, have a seat in a far corner, or have a lot of people's butts rub against you awkwardly. You'll still get a great cocktail. I adore Tavern Law, but last night's experience was too much of a mixed bag to leave as is. First, the mixed drinks there are outstanding. My friend had a Sidecar and said it was one of the finest she'd ever had. My date ordered his favorite drink, a Sazerac, and it was stunning. My cocktail was a delight. And we all had the burger. We all felt it was maybe the best burger we've had in a long, long time. The conversation went something like this: "What is the sauce on this burger? It's amazing. It's like the extract of angels. It's like magical unicorn blood!"I hope the proprietors read this as there are two issues I think need fine tuning.1. The french fries are too salty. I like salt. I love salt. For it to be TOO salty means it's way too salty. Leave the oversalting to those at the table, and leave it out of the kitchen.2. The music playing was horrible. We all felt like we were trapped in a small car on a very long roadtrip with our parents. They played Boston, Journey, Foreigner. For a classy joint outfitted with beautiful Depression era antiques and upholstered walls, I would have preferred something era-appropriate. A little swing music? Some jazz? Big band? Even a quiet hum from the fridges in the back would have been preferred. We'll absolutely go back and we'll order the burger again, but we're going to need extra Sidecars to wash down the fries if they are served that salty again. We went for the wife's birthday. We're new to Seattle and didn't really know that Seattle has a speakeasy fetish. We're from Chicago where we just sit in prohibition era bars and drink.  &#160;That said, the decor wasn't offensive, the place looks nice enough with lots of wood and books that make me feel comfortable. We really wanted to sit at the bar but the few patrons there were all spread out and could have been condensed to let a few others enjoy the bar seating. Instead of asking people to move, we're all about practicing Seattle civility and sat at a table. &#160;We found a seat and were brought some water by guy with attitude. Ok. sure no problem. Guy is a dick. big deal. We're here to have some drinks and have some fun. Forget it and relax. We start to look at the extensive menu and waiter boy comes scooting over and hovers over my shoulder. He insists that we stop looking at the menu and tell him what we like. We really just sat down and could use a minute to chill and catch our breath (we rode our bikes there and were still recovering from the hills- chicago flatlanders). But he insists it's more fun without the menu. So, I indulge. I give him a few kew words and then he starts naming drinks from the menu that I was supposed to close. It was like what? Sorry guy, don't have hyper photographic memory. We shoed him away and he came back for our order in a few minutes. Drinks were small, expensive and complicated. My drinks really lacked a smoothness or a completeness. A little tasty and a little medicinal but never really "there." Maybe it was the sunday bartender? The tiki drink was really good, maybe that's why the charge even more for tiki? The food was tiny. Like expensive yuppie tapas.Overall, wouldn't really go back here unless it was to watch the place burn down. Our waiter was ok. He has mastered the art of being a condescending prick while expecting a big tip. He told us not to take the bike path home because it was dark and dangerous. So we took the bike path home and it was the best part of tavern law. Two friends and I went to grab a drink and while we got to sit where we wanted (outside), it took forever for the host to notice us. He didn't say a word to us when he put the menus on the table. I was looking forward to my drink because the extensive drink menu made me believe Tavern Law does cocktails well, but mine was just ok (Autumn's Folly). I've had much more well-crafted cocktails at a better price. The service got a bit better towards the end of our visit, but I still almost didn't leave a tip.I do admit we enjoyed people-watching the yuppie crowd. For some reason it's refreshing to be around yuppies when you're sick of the Capitol Hill hipster/hippie crowd. While they may be known for their detailed and intense cocktails I found mine to be only so-so. Because the bartenders have to focus so much on each of the intricate drinks they make, they aren't very attentive to the large number of people waiting at the bar as well. Maybe if we had spent more time there and had a few more drinks I would have enjoyed it more. Or maybe if we had made reservations upstairs. Oh well. The decor was very nice though! Amazing drinks freshly prepared friendly bar staff. Best cocktails I have probably ever had overall.Cool inside but tightish for seating, fills up fast.Happy hour all day Sunday. This place is so reminiscent of a bar in the late 1930's-early '40s during the prohibition era. The bartenders are suited up and there's an actual speakeasy to get into an elevator (the door looks like a bank vault) for the "exclusive" floor above. Faux (it looked like) book cases that went from floor to ceiling.There's an extensive bar menu. I decided to order the drink special, some tropical something, that had gin, lime, peach, &amp; bitters. My drink was sooo different than what I was expecting. It was massively spicy! The heat would take effect after a few seconds. The description said nothing about that. I was expecting a bitter/sour taste but not the burning sensation. I would suggest that the staff try their drink specials so they know 1st hand what they taste like. I asked the waiter if it was supposed to taste they way it did, and all he could say was, "I think I may have picked up the wrong drink."So, not only were the drinks expensive, but they got mine wrong. The waiter apologized, re-took my order for another drink, but didn't make any complimentary adjustments to the bill. I will give Tavern Law another chance in respect to their ambience and decor alone, but hopefully I can re-evaulate and increase my stars rating. Service excellent. &#160;Burger/fries, one of the best I've had in Seattle. &#160;Mac n cheese was so/so, drinks were good, but not blast my socks off. &#160;Cool space. &#160;Super hip, including secret upstairs lounge. &#160; I'll be back. Fantastic food, inventive &amp; delicious, inexpensive...Superb gastro-pub food out of one of the smallest kitchens ever. For your first foray into sous-vide cooking you can't go wrong here and you won't drop a ton of money...The cocktails list is extensive and delicious although you can spend some serious dough on drinks--especially if you are upstairs in the Private Bar. The only missteps I have encountered on 4 meals here is occassionally the seasoning was a bit off (a little salty)...but I mentioned it to the cook Ross, and the next time the Fried Chicken was spot-on. Fun spot. I did not like dining upstairs however...trying to have to balance food for 3 Diners/Foodies that love to eat when our table was an awkward ottoman was not good for the back...We ordered tons of food-- almost one of everything off the menu and it all came at once...I would have thought the waiter would have paced it out better. And when asked for another tray to balance dishes on--the waiter brought a tray used for bussing...When asked about which of 2 unfamiliar beers the waiter would recommend-- he said he didn't know cause he doesn't drink beer! (This from one of GQ's Top 25 Bars) Really? I think the (upstairs) waiter needs to study up on his beers. Still, love this place! But in the future I will be sitting downstairs.... This is a cool little bar with a old fashioned vibe. &#160;The quality of the cocktails was the best I had while in Seattle (with a similar vibe as my favorite bar in San Jose). &#160;The real trick is to come early so you can use the little phone and get a place upstairs in the secret speakeasy called Needle and Thread. &#160;We didn't have that opportunity, but maybe next time! My husband hosted my birthday party in their upstairs cool/sneaky speak easy bar. Four stars for:1. Unmatched ambiance2. Quality and taste of cocktails3. Great Bar-tending staff4. Hidden location and private space5. Yummy food6. Availability on a Friday night on one week notice!Minus one star for:1. The event manager who helped my husband schedule the event. She was not very helpful in answering his queries over the phone or email. We wanted to order some food off the catering menu, she kept telling us to show up 30-40 minutes prior to the event and order food for the party of 35 people. When we got there, the server told us we were supposed to order food off the menu days prior &#160;to the event. This was very frustrating and we ended up ordering appetizers off the regular menu that were served in small plates. So the food set up at the event almost looked like it was leftover food sitting on the tables and not meant for our guests. In all fairness the mac and cheese and potato wedges were yummy. Just the set up and coordination with the manager sucked. &#160;Again, the onsite servers were very helpful.Regardless of the unhelpful interaction with the manager, it was a great and memorable birthday party! Amazing drink knowledge! I've only been here twice and I love it! As many of have said, the atmosphere is great, food is delicious and drinks are amazing. The drinks are pretty creative and they usually change up the cocktails and have their regulars. Both times I ordered the burger with pork belly and it is so good! The combination of caramelized onion, pork belly, and burger is amazing. The bun on the burger is just as good and I can just eat it by itself. The bread is soft, buttery and flavorful. Service: the first time I went, our server was great! He was attentive and quick especially when it was quite busy on a weeknight. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same thing about my second visit. I went early on a Tuesday night and there were hardly any patrons. The server took 25 minutes to take our food order after serving our drinks. I had to guzzle done my wine so he could see that my glass was empty to get his attention! If we just wanted to drink, my friend and I would've sat at the bar. When he were done with our meal, he finally cleared our table and my friend asked for the bill. We waited 15 min...and no bill, so my friend actually had to get up and ask the server for the bill! &#160;The service we experienced was unacceptable especially when the restaurant was empty. Instead of paying attention and checking to see if we needed anything, he was busy chatting it up with his coworkers.Even though I experienced bad service, I will still come back because the place is great, food is absolutely amazing and drinks are awesome! I just hope I don't get the crappy server! I hope no one else will have a bad service experience. Executive Summary:Snag some grapefruit gin. Very good stiff drink. Ambiance is what you'd expect from a mega-hyped bar like Tav law. If you are looking for a more chillaxed scene with even better crafted mixes, scope out Sun Liquors near Summit and Mercer. Pros: Go here if you are stumbling by. Cons: Don't go out of your way to make it. After visiting Tavern Law a handful of times now I am quite confident in saying it's my favorite bar. I am not much of a drinker but I always enjoy the quality of the cocktails here. Sure, the drinks are pricey but they are worth it! I also find the service to be a breath of fresh air. No matter how busy it gets I generally feel like my business is still valued and made a priority. The bartenders are as friendly as they are talented and I have been pleasantly surprised by their ability to remember my likes and dislikes. First time here this past Saturday for a Ladies Night. &#160;Service was great, ambiance was classy but not stuffy. &#160;Drink menu is quite large, diverse and exciting, although the drinks weren't as strong as one would expect from the ingredients. &#160;Crowd was mixed as well. &#160;I was most intrigued by the not-so-secret vault door leading to the "secret" speakeasy, the Thread and Needle. &#160;We tried to get a last minute reservation but were turned down. &#160;I actually admire they were sticking to their occupancy limit! &#160;This place takes the art of drinking seriously.We eventually talked our way into the secret entrance for just a quick look about, and it was really neat. &#160;You enter a narrow wooden staircase adorned with 20's pin up girl photos. &#160;The loft-like area has great vintage fixtures, fabric walls, and is just cozy enough without being uncomfortable. &#160;I also liked that it wasn't filled with a bunch of chachi club kids. &#160;The people here were sophisticated and really into the 1920's throwback vibe. &#160;A group was even dressed in pinstriped suits for the guys, flapper dresses with feather headdresses for the ladies. &#160;Very cool.Had some interesting sounding food options on the main floor, but not very veg friendly. &#160;They can do better. &#160;Overall, the Tavern Law is a hip but non-snobby night out. &#160;Recommended! Awesome cocktails that can be described in one word: Vintage.Nice selection of fancy bar style grubs as well. First - this is the current "we don't serve ketchup" place. There's always at least one on Capitol Hill at any given time; ridiculous. The line they give you, when you ask about ketchup, is usually delivered with a healthy dose of snobbery, and an offering of some type of alternative condiment to be served in a tiny tiny dish as a reminder of your silliness for asking. This is how snooty places think they distinguish themselves, and they are right.Had the burger with pork belly based on a recommendation. Acceptable, but by far not the best burger for the steep price. Heartburn later - urgh. Service was just OK, too. Lots of employees walking around, talking, but not so much table service as you'd like (water refills please! etc.) and no friendly banter with our waitress even when we tried hard to engage her.So many other options on the Hill, this one isn't my style at all. I'm way into friendly service and down-to-earth attitudes about food and customers, and this place is neither. Oh yum! &#160;Much like Patterson House in Nashville, which I think I also reviewed, this bar has an unusual drink menu and a lively yet relaxing ambiance. &#160;I wish I took pictures of the drink menu. &#160;I can't remember the name of what I had - something with a raw egg and completely delicious! &#160;For me, this would be a fine night out on its own. &#160;In my partying days, this would be an excellent beginning to a fine night out.Denver restaurateurs - fancy, complicated drinks, low-key atmosphere! &#160;Make one here! The concept and the cocktails are cool, making the trip worthwhile. &#160;The food can be a little haphazard in terms of whether it arrives or not, or if it's what you ordered, but when it did arrive, was delicious. &#160;We had a pork back appetizer, probably no longer on the menu, to die for. &#160; We did not go upstairs. Blood and Thunder with Foie Gras.x2Tavern Law gets a lot of hype, and I admit I kind of avoided it for that reason, and because it sounded a little pretentious, what with the gigantic cocktail menu and the "speakeasy" upstairs. However, I really liked the ambiance and the drinks, which were absolutely as good as their publicity promises, and the foie gras was excellent. Watching the bartenders at work is entertaining and educational, too, fascinating really, and I like to come here to sit and the bar and watch them like a cooking show. Tavern is a great place to impress friends or to spend an hour gawking at the bartender side show, but whatever your reasons, if you like a craft cocktail and fine food, come here. Look, I really can't fault this place.But maybe I should complain about the high prices of their petits plats. Maybe I should bitch and moan about the pretention and other noise that you can experience here. Or perhaps I should point out the limited patience a fickle public has for this whole speakeasy zeitgeist.Well, to hell with that.The cocktails, especially in the speakeasy upper niche, are ...A-fuckin'-mazing.And that's all I have to say, because, frankly, what else really matters? Been here a lot and loved it. But the service has got really uneven. Here on a Tuesday night and waited 30 minutes for a vegetable plate. Same thing happened to table next to me. Restaurant wasn't busy. Wait staff just forgot. been upstairs and downstairs. always packed when i visited. upstairs is cool, though not a whole lotta food selections. i like the way that you order drinks from upstairs... you tell them what your preferences are, what elements you want, and they just make it. no menus. though i didn't particularly love my drink...... so i'm not sure if that was a win afterall. cool place though. also - this place is not cheap.
I love Taste of India! &#160;It's the best Indian food I've found outside of India itself, or at the homes of Indian friends.Would've given 5 stars but they stopped serving alcohol. &#160;The food is still the best I've had, but it's just not quite the same without a big Kingfisher to wash it down. We've been going to Taste of India for more than ten years and have always loved the food, the service, and the beautiful decor. &#160;Having sought out great Indian restaurants in New York, London, LA, and San Francisco, I've never found better Garlic Naan (bread). &#160;And the bottomless chai is incredible.I recently saw that they had replaced the extensive beer and wine selection with juices and soft drinks and I asked the owner why that was. &#160;He said he feels better not sending people out onto the roads, not sure if they ought to be driving. &#160;I admire that principle-based choice. &#160;How often do you see that in business now? &#160;Although my husband often had a Kingfisher with his dinner, the lassi or chai or other drinks are a fine substitute. &#160;Go early or get a reservation on weekend nights, and enjoy the experience. I've never had a bad experience at Taste of India. The food has always been consistent, delicious, and brought out in a timely manner. The menu has tons of options, which can be intimidating until you realize that you can't really go wrong. &#160;The decor is inviting and interesting, &amp; the hosts and servers are always very friendly and professional, sometimes even treating you to a free appetizer or desert. Nice touch.Side note: Best water service in town! My glass is never empty. It's almost comical. If you have an unquenchable thirst, get here. On a bad note, the table busers seem a pretty anxious to either box-up your food, or clear your plates from the table. That behavior always makes me feel like a slob who can't let the last pieces of his meal get taken away from him, especially when I have to fend them off three or four times. &#160;Also, it's a bummer that they don't have any more beer or wine, considering they used to have a HUGE selection of great beer. BEST.INDIAN.FOOD. I've ever had. And DO.NOT.TIP. Explanation to follow.WOW! Lamb Tika Masala, Chicken Vindaloo, Tandori Chicken Tikka, Garlic Naan--we all sampled from each others plates and each item was better than the next.NOTE: They won't seat you until your whole party has arrived. At first I found this annoying but after I was greeted with complimentary Chai and a menu as I sat, I felt more prepared and grateful I had that extra time to reflect on exactly what I was in for.NOTE: We were super put off by the fact that the menu was on the sidewalk and it included gyros...umm, yah baklava and gyros aren't Indian, but we'll see. And why is the waiting staff white teenagers and young mexican women? I understand what a previous reviewer was TRYING to say about not being racist... But once we passed the kitchen to visit the restroom, our fears subsided. The kitchen was bustling with the most Indian of Indian men cooking up hot and spicy and screaming Hindi. Let me assure you, this is authentic!We were seated as soon as we were a whole party and lead through a whirlwind of uneven funhouse type floors and art, tapestries, and more art. Immediately we were served a complimentary appetizer of veggies samosas. FREE STUFF!!!!! I LOVE FREE STUFF! The waiting staff won't let your glass get more than an inch from full before filling it again. It was so amazing we turned it into a game. They are on it! It's a shame they don't get to keep their tips but it kind of helps to know this when you get your bill...4 people = $80.Don't feel too bad; they get paid more than minimum wage to make up for it.At the end of the meal we boxed up the leftovers (great portions), and nommed on our complimentary baklava... MORE FREE STUFF!!!!!!!!!!!GREAT experience. Next time I'm in Seattle, I'm hitting Taste of India! I live on 56th street, and Taste of India is a celebrated part of our little neighborhood. The food is the best I've had since I last had Indian overseas - in particular their naan and mango curry is to die for - and they almost always give our table a complimentary dessert. The table service is nearly borderline obsessive as well - I have yet to finish a single glass of water because they top them off so fast. In addition, ToI was our lifeline during the epic snowstorm this past winter. Their staff somehow braved the inclement weather enough to open, at a time when the ice was inches thick down the pavement, and so none of us starved XD DO NOT TIP HERE!!!Yes, Taste of India offers the best Indian food in Seattle. &#160;Hands down. &#160;However, I have known several people, who have worked there in the capacity of waiters and bussers, and the wait staff do not get to keep their tips. &#160;This is probably illegal, but the management figures that they'll keep the extra 20% left on the tables, and they pay their wait staff a little more than minimum wage.Perhaps ask your waiter before your pay if something has changed, and whether or not they get to keep their tips. &#160;But be sure the 20% you leave is going to the right place. Sunday. 7 pm. 20 minute wait. Though the service is usually on the slow side...the food is always worth coming back for more. To start off the evening, my mini me ordered a cup of chai tea. No other place can compare. Cardamom. Cloves. Cinnamon. Everything you can ask for on a cold night. $2.50 (approx 6 oz) with free refills. She had 5 cups. Best deal in town. Since we had to wait for such a "long" time (it's really nothing out of the ordinary), they gave us a complimentary appetizer. Fried fritters served with chutney. Yum. The entrees were perfect (they always are). I had the Rogan Josh with lamb and my mini me had the Butter Marsala with chicken. Prices are $14.95 each. Portions are a bit big for me so I had leftovers for breakfast the next day. Still delicious. To end the perfect night, we received a complimentary ice cream dessert. A scoop of vanilla ice cream with fine pieces of roasted coconut topping. &#160;It was delicious!Parking can be difficult depending on the time you go. There's about 7 parking spots in front of the restaurant but those are usually snatched up pretty quickly Best bet is to park in the residential area and walk. I've eaten here twice. I ate here about 10 months ago with my Uncle while he was in town for Thanksgiving, and I ate here about two weeks ago with a friend from Cleveland, who suddenly showed up in Seattle and needed someone to show him around. During both occasions, everyone eating this food left the restaurant feeling ecstatic.The menu is a bit intimidating because it is so big; it's so vast that it is difficult to find something that exactly appeals to your tastes. During my latest visit, it took me a good ten or fifteen minutes to settle on an option. No matter. I was enjoying my beer and mulling over the options with my friend. I settled for the Royal Biryani and decided to have it served with lamb. If you are paying over ten dollars for a meal, I figure it is worth an extra dollar or two to get some lamb in lieu of the vegetarian or chicken options. This dish was good because it had a healthy dose of meat, veggies and dairy. The rice was colored with saffron and curry. It was doused with cashews, and sprinkled with cloves and a bay leaf. Finally, it was served with raita on the side--raita being a cucumber yogurt dish somewhat similar to tzatziki sauce. It comes with the meal, so you don't have to order it separately. And, if you request your meal cooked extra spicy, this yogurt sauce will help neutralize the spiciness in your mouth. In addition to the myriads of Indian food options this restaurant carries, it also provides a healthy selection of Mediterranean food choices. My friend ordered a plate of gyro meat, which he greatly enjoyed. After the meal, I ordered a Halvah or Halawah--depending on which language you speak--which is a crushed sesame seed paste formed into a honey flavored candy bar. I love them, though I understand they are sort of an acquired taste. I grew up near a Jewish area of Cleveland inundated with Jewish bakeries, delis and shawarma restaurants, so I love all of these Mediterranean delicacies. Finally, our server brought us out a complimentary Baklava on the house. It was just pulled out of the oven and tasting as fresh as it could ever be. I love baklava, but there is a difference between fresh baklava and two week old baklava sitting in a freezer and thawed out that afternoon. Many places use this latter method, which undoubtedly weakens the flavor; Taste of India, thankfully, does not. Hands down the best Indian food in the general Seattle area. Highly recommend the chicken vindaloo ordered at extra extra spicy - you're in for a treat. If you're feeling ambitious, order the spinach naan; it's like a pizza sized calzone filled with creamy spinachy goodness.I-told-you-so: Watch out for floor. The ground's uneven, and there's no caution signs or yellow tape. Just a black carpet to make things look smooth and even (it's not, and you WILL stub your toe). Was in Seattle, wanted to sample local Indian treats. Came here, was apprehensive because the (highly reviewed) Indian place in Spokane (which bears the same name as this establishment) kind of sucks IMHO. (Bombay Palace is worlds better but is apparently closed for like 6 months, maybe they have to change the sign to "Mumbai Palace"?) Was blown away by the Pit Crew of service people at your disposal: - seating guy - alcohol girl (the beer selection here is impressive for an Indian place, although I don't think they have anything on tap) - multiple water people - appetizer bringer - main dish bringer - dessert salesman Seriously, it was CAH-RAY-ZEE! We got some appetizers that came out practically before we ordered them. Before we could even get halfway through the appetizers... BAM! Hawt Naan in my face (just where I like it). Seriously the food came out almost disturbingly fast. I got the Lamb Madras Chilli *something*, don't remember the exact name. It was mighty, mighty tasty. I told them to make it as hot as they could, we agreed on 6 out of 5 "stars". It was hot, definitely hotter than about 97% of Indian and/or Thai joints I've been to (including Thai Tom), but I could still go much, much hotter (I'm a glutton for punishment people). Still, MASSIVE kudos for taking the training wheels off on the hotness gauge, it's a rare thing to find these days. One more thing. The portions were bigger-than-a-bread-box. GINORMOUS. The spinach naan (I don't know the fancy "real" name for it, sorry) we got looked like a freakin' Chicago deep-dish pizza! The rice resembled a mini Rainier, and the curry was overflowing. I ate it all, and was in extreme pain for the rest of the day (I wasn't sure I was going to have the facilities to preserve the left overs and I was nervous about the little kids in China that don't get to eat Indian food)Some last +'s on this place:+ parking is not that bad (for Seattle)+ prices here are very reasonableWhy no 5 stars?- even though they are hotter than most, they still could go hotter- speaking of hot, we went here on a summer day and were SWEATING...it was beyond toasty inside. After sharing 5 entrees, 3 types of naans, 2 appetizers and a 25 hour roadtrip ahead of us, the pit stops were not worth it. I remember even begging any god that was available to magically place a bathroom on the 405. But i will tell you out of everything i ordered, the tandoori and tikka masala weren't that bad. we're just spoiled in SF. The best indian food!These people used to own Ceders in the U-District on 50th. I'm not sure why they dont any more, but the new owners and new cooks dont quite get the menu right at Ceders. Taste of India is the shiz...My wife loves the butter chicken, I usually go for the lamb mango curry with lots of spice. Don't miss the nan. I must've unknowingly worn the "Sex Panther by Odeon" fragrance (Anchorman, anyone?) when I walked into this joint with my "entourage", because I've never gotten so much free stuff (without selling my body). It started with an appetizer (delicious deep fried vegetable something-something), then a refreshing mango lemonade, and a sweet finish (pun intended) of indian tapioca (I think?) yogurt and baklava. I was expecting the manager to ask us for our autographs, but alas, he knew better.Of course, the food itself was de-lish. My money dish is the spinach naan, but I've tried all sorts of other dishes and love it. The owners used to run the legendary Cedars (ironically a few blocks away) too until a few months ago. I know where my loyalties lie. Service is on top of it, perhaps a little too overzealous with the water-pouring... guess they want to make sure you're properly hydrated in case your order is above your spice comfort level. WOW How did I forget to review this restaurant??I always enjoy coming here. Parking is easy if you don't mind walking a bit . The wait is long if you come at a busy time.. it is a popular place! I go early or for lunch.I like most vegetable dishes. I also usually have chicken marsala. The sweet drinks.. never are for me, so I know that lesson and have chai when I am being wild or water! This is the first Indian restaurant I've been to so I was a little unsure of what to order. &#160;The waitress was absolutely wonderful and suggested different items based on what I thought I would like. &#160;I got the Tandoori Chicken Tikka.. soooo freaking good and the garlic naan was perfect to soak up the curries.The atmosphere was very nice and the service was excellent. &#160;The only thing I can really complain about was how hot it was inside. &#160;I was with a party of 5 people and all of us were sweating the entire time. &#160;I did comment on the heat and the waitress said they were preparing something for tomorrow which is why it was so hot. &#160;Obviously the food was so good we ignored the sweat pouring down our faces, but we didn't linger after we finished the food either. This place is the "new" Cedars. &#160;By that I mean, Cedars was the best Indian restaurant in Seattle, then the owner sold it (name and all) and opened the Saffron Grill in Northgate. &#160;Taste of India is owned by the same family (the son of the former owner of Cedars) and is run the same way.Amazing Indian food- I've never had better. &#160;I love the somewhat shabby "well loved" look of the interior (they are too busy cooking delicious food to worry about fancy decor). &#160;Love everything about it, best Chai I've ever had. "So, I know we're here for Indian food... but did we just walk into a Vegas chapel?"Ignore the daunting fear that you might accidentally get your marriage license here and just focus on the food! This place is the new restaurant that the people that used to own Cedars have all gone to. And let me just say that they took everything good with them, and just left the poor buyers of Cedars with no soul of Indian food.If you remember the good old days of Cedars being THE GO TO PLACE for indian food, don't fret b/c they're under near management, just go to Taste of India! The food is still awesome, and their ever-eager staff is still as eager as ever. Sure, there are a little nit-picky things here and there, but I think the food and service really make the place special. This place is highly recommended. Again and again. Taste of India? I THINK SO!The SUBWAY guy led us here. It was a risk but I took off on an adventure to this great restaurant. &#160;* FIRST IMPRESSION: UMmMMMm am I in Vegas? You can't miss  &#160; the place it is lit up with neon, which made me first wonder if this  &#160; place was going to be worth it.*SECOND IMPRESSION: what the hell man! Why is the Naan so  &#160; freakin' huge! For $2.50 you can get a better sized Naan that isn't  &#160; burnt and tastes great!* THIRD IMPRESSION: Spices were ridiculous! Everything was  &#160; flavorful, robust, and sensational. ** RECOMMENDATIONS &amp; HINTS:1) If you like spicy but still want to taste the food ask for medium hot  &#160; &#160;(aka #4)2) Order the garlic naan. period.3) Order the JAIPURI MASALA: It is prepared with tomatoes, onion,  &#160; &#160; ginger, garlic, and paneer4) All dishes can be made either vegetarian, lamb, beef, chicken, fish,  &#160; &#160; or prawn. Prices range from $8.95 to 14.95.ENJOY!!! This is probably my favorite place to get Indian food in Seattle. &#160;It's usually pretty crowded, so there's often a wait...but I think it's worth it.I came here after a pole dancing class with a girlfriend, and we brought along the boyfriend. &#160;We sat down and were quickly served with complimentary appetizer of pakoras. &#160;YUM!!!We opted to go family style and got garlic naan, &#160;channa masala with potatoes (I think this is my favorite Indian dish, it's chickpeas, potatoes in a tomato based sauce), vegetarian samosas, aloo gobi (sauteed potatoes and cauliflower), and &#160;vegetable coconut curry. &#160;So I may totally be crazy here, but my favorite part of eating here is the tamarind sauce. &#160;They seriously make the best tamarind sauce ever! &#160;It's made there (I know this because I once asked where they bought it and they told me it was house made, so I then proceeded to ask if I could buy a container of it to bring home to eat. &#160;They obliged by giving me a huge container filled with it). &#160;They have a cilantro chutney that is good, but honestly the tamarind is so good I just ignore the cilantro. &#160;The boyfriend eats that one, since I don't share the tamarind chutney with him. :PThe food was fantastic and my tummy feels amazingly full and happy right. After we were done eating, they brought out a complimentary cheesecake. &#160;Are you kidding me? &#160;TWO complimentary dishes?!?! &#160;AWESOME! &#160;The cheesecake was so light and fluffy, not dense like other cheesecakes I've had in the past. &#160;The three of us shared the cheesecake and left no bite remaining.Best part of the meal? &#160;We had enough food for all of us to have lunch the next day, and when I asked if it was possible to pack up the remaining tamarind sauce (I told you, I'm a whore for this stuff), the waitress was ever so kind to bring me a small container with extra tamarind sauce for the road on top of the sauce at the table. &#160;SWEET! WOW! Some of the best Indian food I have had in my life! Don't mind the wait as they bring you some hot chai to enjoy...Disclaimer: we were with regulars &amp; they brought over on the house pakoras and then at the end of the meal cheesecake with mango sauce. Both were delicious!Each of the meals is big enough to share or enjoy on your own. Don't be afraid to experiment here. I had the chicken mango curry and was blown away with it's sweet and spiciness with each bite. Dip your nan (we got regular but there are a few to choose from) in your sauce and soak it all up or go all out and order one of the stuffed parathas (a Marc A favorite) for eating and dipping. Enjoy! I love me some Indian food, and this is the best I've ever eaten. &#160;I've been four times now and gotten the chicken tikka masala every time--because it's THAT delicious. &#160;Oh, and the naan is gloriously huge and tasty.Also being a great fan of beer, I can happily report that they have HUNDREDS of beer varieties in their three cases--everything from local microbrews to Belgian ales. &#160;The only downside is that they don't have a single brew on tap. :-(As if the food and beer weren't enough, the service is spectacular. &#160;The owner or manager is always at the front door to greet you with a smile. &#160;Servers stop by often to check on you. &#160;They must have three or four employees whose only responsibility is to make sure that your glass is filled to the brim. &#160;Oh, and they've always given me FREE chai tea AND dessert (rice pudding and/or cheesecake)!This review doesn't even do this place justice. &#160;If you haven't been, check it out. &#160;You will not be disappointed. From what I understand, this place is owned by the brother or cousin of the owner of Cedars. So, it's the same style of Indian cuisine, similar prices and flavors, but without the terrible service! Cedars ranks among the worst restaurants I've ever been to in terms of rudness from the entire staff. At Taste of India, just a 1/2 mile up on Roosevelt, you get the same (if not better) quality of food with great service. Amazing concept!When I get a craving for East Indian food, this is where I go. Best Indian food in Seattle. Hands down. I'm always really happy with my meals here, and they give you enough for two meals. Totally worth the money.I'm a big paneer freak, so I pretty much always get something with paneer. The shahi korma, the shimla paneer, the veggie kofta, and one other dish, begins with an N, that I'm forgetting the name of (the bottom of the list on the menu at the restaraunt) are all so good. Garlic naan = awesome. My boyfriend is super picky and not adventuresome about food, but he loves the coconut curry chicken. They often will comp you an appetizer and dessert, too. Veggie pakoras or samosas for appetizer. Baklava or mango cheesecake for dessert. There are two drawbacks to this place, though:1. It's pretty much always super busy. (but they will give you a chai while you wait to be seated...nice!)2. The restaurant itself is kinda byzantine and cave-like. So it's not the fanciest place inside and can feel a little cramped.The other thing to know...they are super attentive with the service. I actually like that, but if you are bugged by constant drink refilling and busing of plates, you'll find it pretty irritating. Save yourself the trouble and get some carry-out instead. It's just as good. Unlimited Chai, complimentary dessert. &#160;How can you go wrong?I like to eat lunch here because I love their (pre-sweetened) Chai and they give free refills. &#160;As a result of drinking on average four cups of Chai, I have a hard time going to sleep at night.I've favored Taste of India to Cedar's since Cedar's changed ownership and the service deteriorated. &#160;The food is (or at least used to be) pretty much the same. &#160;This is the only place I know of that make the spinach naan. &#160;It's actually big enough to be a (vegetarian) meal in itself when I'm not hungry.Also, I don't know what the formula is, but I have gotten complimentary dessert sample here more often than not. I feel like everyone is going to hate me after this review because everyone is raving about this place, so don't get too angry with me! I didn't really enjoy my dining experience here. I came here for dinner on a Friday with my auntie, her man, and my boyfriend. It was easy to find street parking and we were greeted with the nicest hostess ever. Food was mediocre and for 4 people, it came to about $65 not including tip. I feel like that is ALOT for Indian food that didn't really stand out nor was it oustanding in flavor. As for service, well, it was almost too good to the point where we were annoyed. I am speaking honestly here when I say that 1 out of 2 times we took a sip out of our water, someone would come over instantly to refill it. Isn't that just wasting water? I appreciate their effort to serve their customers well though, but I think they can just take it down a notch. If you order naan, get the plain naan. The garlic one was really greasy. Don't get me wrong, the food was really good. The naan was one the best I have ever had!! But the service - DUDE! Can it be any worse? The servers seemed to be polite but they do screw up on orders a lot. I mean a LOT. And they seem to be used to "comp" the food they screwed up on. We got a wrong appertizer and had to wait extra for the right appertizer to come. We ordered a regular Taste of India sampler appertizer (with meat), a vegetarian one came by mistake. I was fine with that because I am a peskatarian so I wouldn't have eaten the non-vegetarian one anyway. BUT it scares me to think if non-vegetarian was served to us after ordering vegetarian plate! I would be upset if bite into a meat sampler. Ack! (I am sure all the vegetarians would feel the same!!)And right after that, everybody else got food, where was mine?? Finally about 5min after everyone else started eating, a server came and asked what I was waiting for. I told him what I ordered, and he said he would grab it. And another 10min passed, then another guy came, he asked the SAME exact question I answered 10min ago! "Miss, are you waiting on something? What did you order?" I was like "what the hell!?" Then another 5-10min for my food to come :-( By the time I got my food, everyone else was almost finished eating. They comped the food again but I was like... meh! Used to love, love, love this place. My last experience pretty much sucked. Bland "Indian" food, ok service, nothing special. Really, that sums it up- nothing special. Crap. I feel like I cheated on my boyfriend. &#160;You see, my boyfriend and I have been favoring a particular Indian restaurant in Lynnwood for some time now and never found a restaurant that particularly measured up. &#160;We've built a rapport with the staff of this Lynnwood restaurant and we've fallen in love with the food. But then, last night, we fell in love with a new restaurant. Holy moly Taste of India was amazing! I went in there ready to nit-pick it. Ready to tell the folks why it wasn't as good as my favorite little Indian restaurant. I was sure I wouldn't like it. But I had one sip of delicious chai brought to us with lightening speed, and then one bite of veggie pakora, compliments of that night, &#160;and then savored my butter chicken like none other on this planet and I knew I would have the heart-breaking experience of breaking up with my old favorite. Sure, delicious Lynnwood Indian restaurant and I can be friends, but my true love will be Taste of India. &#160;Oh bother.See my old love, tasty Lynnwood Indian restaurant was attentive to my water and rice needs but Taste of India filled my chai cup up before I could even finish it. My boyfriend and I were waited on hand and foot in Taste of India's amazingly well-oiled machine of a restaurant. We never waited one second too long for anything. &#160;The service was impeccable. I would have to say, the only criticism I have is that they can be over-attentive. With so many staff members trying to keep busy and make sure customer's are happy, it can be ever so slightly annoying being asked if everything's okay every five-mins. Tone that down just a hair Taste of India. &#160;I'm not sure I can handle that much attention. We ended our dinner with complimentary baklava that was baked perfection. We would have loved that place despite the free food but the extra special attention was really sweet. $15+ for a small plate of Indian food....? &#160;I am so used to Indian food being really heavy from Boston and extremely heavy on the clarified butter in Los Angeles and under $10 for a lot more.$15 is not much in Boston and Los Angeles but for Seattle it seems a little high.The food was light and good. &#160;The Indian workers were prompt and kind but the others well....they can use a little training. I wandered in here recently having driven past the giant billboard a few times. &#160;The interior was very cozy - romantic, even - with low ceilings and candlelit tables. &#160;The waitstaff seemed suspiciously large, but I will assume they normally have more business on Thursday nights (this was a big snow day). &#160;The food was ok, but everything was just a little off. &#160;The papadum was almost more flaky than crispy and came with two chutneys in a single dish, the chicken tikka masala was too sweet and made with not-so-amazing dark meat, and they brought out baklava with the bill. &#160;I never figured out the Mediterranean/Indian mix they were going for here, but hey, surprise baklava - who's complaining? &#160;(I am: it was too buttery and warm.) &#160;All in all a decent meal, but not worth the trek through the snow. WOW! This is some of the best service I've had in the city! They are so attentive, i felt like every time i looked down my water glass was full! You can get free refills on your chai, and the food is great!I wouldn't be afraid to go too spicy, i got a 2 and I didn't taste much spice at all.They often give free dessert to us when we go. :) This is ACTUALLY my favorite Indian restaurant for sure.I've always liked the food since I first tried it 4 years ago. I still remember that first time, actually. On a date. Thought the place was cheezed out, over-friendly staff. But everything was great.Then I heard about the management/staff/chef changes with Cedars. I think it's just gotten even better.But the best experience had to be my last visit there. I mean, OK, we had to wait for 50 mins, big whoop. Maybe it was a big whoop. But I slept through most of it. Standing up. Don't ask, this was during finals week at school. During the wait time, we were given bottomless chai, innumerable apologies from the owner and everyone on their payroll. I wasn't even bumming, cause it was kinda our fault for not making a reservation with such a big group. I think there were 11 or 12 of us?Soon as we got to our table, appetizers were already waiting for us. We were then offered a free champagne, which we obliged to, and free desserts, which we initially declined but were very happy to eat anyway. Wait staff was super attentive--to the point of annoyance to some in our group. But I really don't mind. I like having our servers actually 'wait' on us. It's always easier to tell them to ease up and leave you alone than it is to get more service and attention from lousy servers. That's my philosophy on that.In conclusion,50 minutes of waiting = bottomless chai, tons of appetizers, beer and champagne, desserts - ALL FREEThat's a good deal.And I'm all about good deals. The waiiiitt !!!! Why would you want to bring a Naan bread first and let it go cold before The meal ? It doesnt make sense. Food was good, nothing compare to sf bay area indian food though You know you're eating excellent Indian cuisine when many of the diners among you are Indian! &#160;The Vegetable Kafta and Tandoori Salmon Tikka are my all time favorites, and I never even knew I liked Indian food at all! &#160;The neighborhood is a bit edgy and unpleasant, but it doesn't matter. &#160;I'd go just about anywhere they are because their food is that good! &#160;And the bottomless cup of chai is my favorite comfort in the whole world. So for starters, this joint gets a 1 star deduction because literally every time my girlfriend or I took even the slightest sip of water or chai one of two official beverage servers barged into the middle of our pleasant/private conversation to top off the beverage. &#160;While I certainly appreciate avoiding an empty beverage, such stalking was quite disruptive and totally unnecessary. &#160;What was strange about the service, in addition to the constant water filling, was that it took at least 20 minutes (seriously, we counted) to get our check, and only did so after refreshing our befuddled server's memory a couple of times that we indeed had not gotten our check (ya know dude, we're still sitting here with an empty table and bored facial expressions!). &#160;During the meal we had probably 5 different people dealing with us, which probably explains the missing check. &#160;The manager-looking guy was very friendly, but it seems they need to re-organize their duty-distribution system (less water-more timely check) as I'd rather deal with one competent/focused person than a small army.As for the food...I assumed 3 stars out of 5 on the spicy scale meant I would definitely sense some heat/flavor. &#160;Not so. &#160;Perhaps they've dumbed down the spiciness for finicky Americans? &#160;I'm kinda curious to try the 5 star, but I don't plan to go back, so I guess I'll never know. &#160;The chicken tikka masala I had was otherwise pretty good, but for ~$15 &#160;I was disappointed that it was not substantially better than the frozen $4 options at the Trader Joe's down the street. &#160;One last warning: &#160;Anyone over 6' tall needs to watch out for low ceilings! I'm hard pressed to find an Indian place in this city that doesn't serve awesome food...Taste of India sure as heck did serve up some delicious fare. What sets this place a part is the killer customer service. While waiting in a (short) line for a table, we were served hot chai. Complimentary appetizers were served to us the minute we sat down at the table, and at the end of the meal? You guessed it...free dessert. Not sure why we got all these goodies but I'm not complaining. Love this place. The service was fantastic, and the food was pretty good. &#160;Of the several indian restaurants I've tried in Seattle so far, this was definitely the best.I do feel that they have "americanized" the flavors on the food and toned them down a bit. &#160;I asked for "medium" spiciness, and couldn't even feel the heat. &#160;So if you want spicy, you might have to tell them "Indian spicy."Their naan, especially their spinach naan is fantastic. My restaurant-loving friend dragged me here after a whole day's shopping at Northgate Mall and U Village. At first I was a little miffed at walking all the way here from the UW campus at night, but the food was good. I got a falafel salad, and it was delectable! However, for dessert, I ordered something like a nougat, which was yummy too, but WAY too small to be worth the $3 or $5 that I paid for it. every time i drive by and see the crazy wait at this place i am perplexed. &#160;its good, just not worth it. I have to disagree with Zagat Rating on this one unfortunately...Were about to go to Red Mills Burger for lunch but too packed so we decided to go around and spot this Indian restaurant with a "Best of Zagat" sign on it.The service were ok, could've been better. The staff kept asking if we're done with the plate (the frequency was wayyyyy too often). I hate it so much when the staff keep asking if we're done with the plates. It's as though they're trying to kick us out.We ordered a bread called Mint Nan for appetizer. It was great at first bite (maybe cos i was super hungry) but OK afterwards.We also ordered Masala Lamb Curry and Chicked Curry. When the dish came I'm already disappointed. there were only 7-8 small pieces of meat. The curry itself does not taste good. Way too sweet, as if they use only sugar.. C'mon!!!! gimme more meat!!!! if you cannot make good curry at least.The star of the whole dish is the Tendoori Salmon. Perfectly cooked, nice guacamole/sweetsoy cause, 2 big chunck of salmon fillet, rice, and mixed veggies. This one is 4.5-5 star dish I have to say... The other plus is the rice. It was perfectly cooked, seasoned, and tasted great!! They gave us an Indian cake to share at the end but it was a disastrous cake...Overall, they deserves 3 of my stars, thanks to their Tendoori Salmon. I think they need to teach their staff not to only clean up the table but to understand their customer. The price is $$, we spent $25 a person which were overpriced for a meal this quality, ESPECIALLY When I accidentally spot the dirty kitchen as I was going to the restroom. I love it there!! &#160;The last time I was there, I had the veggie samosas, butter chicken, and nan--all great! &#160;Then the manager brought us some baklava--on the house, which was the best I've ever had!! I would rate it more like a 3.5.. For sure not the best or most authentic Indian food in the world, but most aren't.. The food is definitely good for the price, most Indian restaurants overcharge for the ingredients and time it takes to make. &#160;But maybe im bias beacuse i was a cook at a couple indian restaurants for years. i have never been unsatisfied expect when they forgot to put my naan in a take out order so i had to go back and my food was kind of cold when i actually got to eat.. But hey shit happens.. I wouldn't go to far out of my way to go here but will eat here again.. Prompted to action looking for a new Indian joint as well as a "buy one get one" coupon, my girlfriend and I tried this place about two weeks ago. The naan was absolutely fabulous, but the meal left something to be desired. I had the butter chicken, very tasty, but my other half had the mango veggie curry and it definitely was some of the most poor mango curry dishes that I've tried. The waitstaff was prompt and polite, and of course, keep the water coming. Plus, we were offered a free dessert of chocolate ice cream. Still, I don't think we'd be back with the other Indian offerings in the near vicinity. Thanks for listening. I guess the food is pretty good, but this restaurant makes me feel like a cow being herded for the slaughter. &#160;The atmosphere is just not amenable to enjoying a meal. I walked by here once and thought it looked like it should be a wedding chapel in Vegas. The cluster of people waiting to get in told me otherwise. &#160;I joined several friends for dinner who raved about the place. &#160;I was forewarned about the service - super attentive and more. &#160;I was not disappointed. &#160;Waitstaff stood in the shadows just waiting for me to spill some water, drop some rice, or even have a hint of a look that anything was needed. When I arrived, there was already a little appetizer provided on the house, which of course, we had to follow with 2 orders of naan; pesto and chicken, which were served with our dinner - and HUGE and pretty awesome (this could have also stemmed from the fact I had went to the gym earlier and was famished - or so it seemed). &#160;We all ordered the tandoori chicken, which I was assured would not disappoint. It did not. &#160;I wanted it a little spicy, and was probably conservative with my 2 1/2 stars (of 4), but you never know when trying somewhere new, and I wanted to be able to taste the food.I did appreciate the on-the-house cheesecake at the end (authentic??) but we were way to full to even take a bite. &#160;Immediately our table was cleared as they stood by waiting for us to empty our leftovers into boxes. &#160;I really did appreciate the fact that we were given space as we lingered afterward, on a semi-slow night.Yes, the service is attentive, yes, the food is good, and yes, I will return. &#160;Gotta love that naan...my favorite. This place is terrific, and not just for the food. &#160;Each time we've gone we've had a wonderful meal to be sure, but the exceptional service made an even bigger impression. &#160;When we were there on Friday night there was a long wait, so the waitstaff brought free cups of chai for us to sip. &#160;Then, when there was a small delay in our entrees arriving (one that truthfully we hadn't even noticed), the manager surprised us with a free appetizer. &#160;Even though the place was slammed and there was a line out the door, our drinks stayed refilled and they checked on us frequently to make sure we were satisfied. &#160;Very highly recommended. Taste of India has been my go-to Indian food favorite since my very first encounter w/Indian food in the late 90's. &#160;I was told by my friends who introduced me that it was the best ever. &#160;I had never tried Indian food ...one and done, I loved it, and of course, I had to try every other Indian restaurant in Seattle and beyond, to validate this "best ever" claim ...I always came running back to T of I !!! &#160;Mohammed was a single young guy when I first started going there ....and I remember him telling me that he was going to India to get married ...and now he has 3 kids, and he's remembered me since the first time I came in ...always a big smile, and a warm hello ....one drink of chai tea, and someone is filling up your glass, as with water, and as soon as you are finished, table is cleared and wiped ....I love their assembly line process, not just one waiter, but a team of people treating you like royalty throughout the meal, with Mohammed checking in occasionally too to make sure everything is perfect :-) &#160;This is a super busy restaurant, but they work quickly and efficiently, and it is well worth the wait! &#160;Delicious!!!!! The fact that I have always had to wait to be seated here is a strong testament to the popularity (and deliciousness) of this restaurant. &#160;This is the best Indian food in the area, and definitely the best service in town! Let me start by saying that I am not racist. I just feel like the only people that should be allowed to work at an Indian Restaurant should be people of Indian descent. I feel let down when I walk into an Indian Restaurant when I am greeted by a white teenage boy and seated by a hispanic woman. To make things worse here, I am the majority, not the minority. You see, I spent a lot of sleepless nights researching where I was going to take my Sri Lankan BF out to eat while he was in town for a short weekend. I read through countless Yelp reviews, did a lot of googling, read articles in The Stranger and Seattle Weekly. I narrowed it down to Cedars, Taste of India, and Bombay Terrace. Maybe it was the large amount of reviews that convinced me to try this place. I should have just stuck to my gut and gone back to Spice Route in Bellevue/Redmond where Indian people actually go to eat. After being seated we ordered drinks. They do not carry Lions Lager, this was the first thing that disappointed the BF. This is a beer that is found in Ceylon, a European pale ale. He settled for something more generic, but was happy that the beer selection was still descent. We split the Tandoori chicken Tikka and the Coconut Curry with fish. We ordered the curry "hot" ignoring the Yelp reviews that have stated that hot meant you would not really be able to taste the food. Oh and the Garlic Naan of course. The Naan the size of an extra large pizza was wonderful. Somehow we ate all the Naan. This stuff was addicting. The Tandoori was only OK. I am not sure if this is common, but eating the onions completely uncooked along with boring potato cubes was not my idea of "veggies". The fish curry had a good flavor, but the spice level again, was not thaaaattt hot. I ate all of it and could still taste my food.. amazing I know.Then last but not least we were served the complimentary baklava? dessert. This is where things got strange. You see, this is Indian food, I understand that they do serve some Mediterranean/ Middle Eastern dishes here as well, but if you are going to give a complimentary dessert keep it from the same country! Give me some Kulfi or something! I know what you are thinking "wow.. what an ungrateful b*tch!" But really this pushed me over the edge. I want authenticity when Im going to eat Indian food. I feel as though the owners of this restaurant have sold out in every way. It's like McDonald's or Starbucks secretly have stock in this restaurant. Give me a break you 200+ reviewers, go to Spice Route and then maybe you will understand what real Indian food, from the taste to the overall restaurant experience, should taste like. WOW. if only you knew how amazing this place is!!!!!!!!!!!!! &#160;seriously, even if you "dont like indian food" just GO!!!!! this is the smoothest most flavorful indian food i've ever had! compared even to other types of food, i would definately stick with this place!! like i said, JUST GO!!! and it is true, your water glass will never be half full...what a great place :O))) We love this place....yes the service lacks a little but the food is great! we love the naan and vegetable picora is awesome. expect to wait about 45 minutes &#160;for your food ...but hey good things take time! Friendly staff, tasty food, good portions, reasonable price! &#160;Our office went there twice to celebrate birthdays, and they always gave the birthday person some free dessert treat, i.e. a piece of cheesecake or baklavas. &#160;For starters, they serve tasty veggie pakoras which are fried in chickpea flour. &#160;I love the tandoori chicken tikka, even though some people are creeped out by the red food coloring. &#160;No matter to me as I eat stuff like chicken feet and tripe. &#160;Portion was big, enough for two meals.
When we want a quick take out Indian food, we usually call here. We used to go to Cedars but Taste of India is closer to our house.I like their food. This place is always really crowded but they seem to have fast and good service. I like their butter chicken, Tandoori dish, and mango lassi. Yummy yum yum-o-tastic yumminess abounds here. Why, then, only four stars?THE SPONGE.After the dinner course, when you're sippin' on your endless chai of unparalleled deliciousness and unbuttoning the top button on your jeans because you're stuffed to the gills with spinach naan and buttery curries, some "neurotically helpful" staff member will come by and wipe down your table with a sponge.But this, dear readers, is no mere sponge. This sponge contains the stench power of 5 high school boys' locker rooms in one neat four inch by six inch by two inch package. It has never seen the interior of a microwave. Chuck Norris fears this sponge. It leaves foamy shards, uncomfortable streak marks and little wet puddles of death in its wake.It is, in one word... rank. Come here often, but fear the sponge. Indian food doesn't love me, but fortunately for Indian food, I love it!Now, I don't go out to many Indian restaurants simply because there's something in the food that does not usually agree with the KTrain. It's not the spici-ness factor that gets me.. it's some sort of something (a spice, maybe) in the food that my stomach simply cannot comprehend.That being said, when I want to be really naughty and send my stomach into a tainspin, there's a few places around town I like to go to. Taste of India is one of them.Their Tandoori Chicken is outstanding, as is their Baigan Bhartha, which is what i normally get. It's grilled eggplant, mashed and seasoned and paired with saut&#233;ed onions, green peas, and tomatoes. It's very good and there's always a plethora of delicious naan for serious scoopage.The service is great and the ambiance is pretty good too. The weird slope in the floor always throws me for a loop, but I guess it keeps things interesting, right?I hear the rice pudding is fantastic.. I'll be indulging in this the next time I go. We were looking for someplace to eat for a late lunch and after not wanting happy hour food else where, my wife and I stumbled upon Taste of India. &#160; There was a Yelp sticker in the doorway, so that gave it some cred right there.We were greeted and quickly seated and our water glasses delivered and filled. &#160;We ordered beef samoas, vegetable pakoras and spinach and paneer naan as an appetizer and &#160;chicken vindaloo, chicken tikka masala as the main course. &#160;Being the first time here, we ordered the food medium - you never can tell about how spicy it could be. &#160;Just about everything had your choice in meat available, so there were lots of options.Our food quickly came and I wouldn't even call it medium spicy. &#160;Thats when we realized that the majority of the people in the restaurant were not of Indian descent! &#160;The chicken was nicely done and tender, but the curries were bland. &#160;It was good, but nothing special.The service was great - we only had waters and they were always kept full.I probably won't return here. &#160;It's not that the food was bad, it just wasn't good. I think that there is better Indian food elsewhere in Seatte. It is, in fact, possible to be OVER-served. This isn't something I would typically find to be problematic- generally, I like to be the center of attention and to have the owner come make sure that my meal was satisfactory and to have a waiter who flirts with me...But tonight... holy MOLY! The first thing we noticed when we pulled up was a "Help Wanted" sign in the window. "You should work here!", I said to one of my dining companions. We walked inside and the host asked us if we'd like a table for three. And then another person asked if wanted a table for three. And then a THIRD person asked if we'd like a table for three, and then took us to one. Fine. Then began the compulsive water glass-filling. One sip and someone (well, four someones) was filling it up again. Excellent, since my food was particularly spicy, but wow. The food was fantastic. I wanted my lamb vindaloo "really really really really really spicy" and that's exactly what I got. We received complementary chicken pakoras at the beginning of the meal, and complementary baklava at the end. The main host checked in with us TWICE to make sure everything was alright. The cute server who flirted with me was omnipresent- at the table. At the front stand. On my way to the bathroom. Our plates were cleared instantly. Several different people took our orders at various stages of the meal (beverages, entrees, dessert). All in all, I think that at least 9 different people contributed in some way or another. Therefore, based on this experience, I fail to see the need for the "Help Wanted" sign in the window. I feel I was over-helped, forcing me to wolf down my food and contributing to a rather frantic dining experience. I refuse to deduct any stars because of this, since it's such a nice problem to have, and I applaud them for what seems to be a well-oiled machine. But in general, I prefer to have a leisurely Indian-food-dining experience, and this was not one. Four hours later, I am still in a food coma, but looking forward to my leftovers. I prefer this place over Cedars. The menu appears to be the exact same... But the atmosphere, the service, the food, is seemingly better. I always get garlic naan and butter chicken (or maybe sometimes butter masala).I fear the sponge though!!!! This review might be biased because I haven't had Indian food in 2 years...but not to worry, I remember what good Indian food tastes like and I would consider this good Indian food.For food, we ordered the chicken tikka masala, beef vindaloo and onion nan. &#160;We ordered both dishes "hot", but the vindaloo turned out to be spicier than the tikka masala. &#160;Both came with a huge (separate) plate of basmati rice and the nan was about the size of a small newborn. &#160;I found the entrees to be tasty, but not as spicy as I had hoped. &#160;For drinks, we ordered a mango lassi and mango lemonade, both of which were good. &#160;Oh, and I liked that they had a jar of pickled mango chutney as a condiment and gave customers a little piece of dessert (free is always good). TIP: &#160;If any Yelpers have the Entertainment Book, there's a coupon in it that'll save you up to $12 off any entree. So for our regular get-together, my friends and I decided to go to Taste of India after they raved continuously about how good the mango chicken curry was there. I show up early and sat in the parking lot waiting for my friends. The parking lot was pretty small, maybe 6-8 cars would be able to fit. But as I sat there, I saw waiters, the busboys, and even the owner come out and dump the trash or load up a car for what looks like a catering service that they provide as well. Since the parking lot was small, I thought they might come up to me and ask what I was doing just sitting in their parking lot, but to my surprise, they didn't! So far so good . . .My friends finally arrive and we walk in to what looks like a receiving line! We were pretty early into the dinner hour and so there were definitely more servers than there were customers. We sat down and ordered some beef samosa, chai iced tea, garlic and paneen naan, and the famous mango curry. As we were waiting for our orders, the owner comes over and brings us a FREE appetizer plate filled with an assortment of treats! I'm not sure what everything was, but who cares! It was free! We then looked around and noticed that the only other table that got free appetizers too was a table of girls!The food was okay. It wasn't an amazing display of Indian cuisine, but it was decent. I loved the Chai Iced Tea though! They kept refilling it everytime it got low and it was simply divine! The beef samosa was okay (it didn't have that much flavor), and the naan was light and fluffy, but you could hardly taste the difference between the paneen and the garlic except for a hint of garlicky-ness on the garlic naan. Because of the free appetizers, we were pretty stuffed by the time the entree arrived. The mango curry was pretty good, but it wasn't as my friends made it out to be! The chicken was tender but I think the Basmati rice could've had more saffron in it.Afterwards, our bill came along with a FREE dessert! Cheesecake with mango syrup! Whoa! My friend was saying that when she came with her bf, she would get free dessert too, but it wasn't cheesecake but rather an Indian biscotti-like thing and no appetizer! So we finally figured out that if you come here, come with a bunch of cute girls and you'll get more freebies! The prices were pretty reasonable. I would've given it 3 stars, but with all the free treats, it bumped it up to 4!The other yelpers were right in that they do clean the table while you're still sitting there, but that's minor to me. I never felt like they were rushing us to go or anything. When we did finally leave, the owner again came over and shook our hands?! Kinda strange, not used to a handshake after dinner . . . but overall a pretty good visit! I've only been here once, so perhaps I had an unusual experience, but if this is the best Indian food in Seattle then I feel bad for Seattle. &#160;I had the same experience as other reviewers here: hot and stuffy, obsessive water-refills, and I was absolutely shocked at them sponging off the table in front of me. &#160;I've never seen that before, anywhere. &#160;Bringing out a half-used bottle of oily flavorless "mango relish" was also a huge turn-off. &#160;If you don't have the mango chutney anymore freakin' sharpie it off the menu, or at least spoon it out of the jar into a small dish so it's not so obvious.They also forgot to spice our food, I ordered medium-hot and my companion ordered medium, and neither were spicy in the least. &#160;Without the spice the food was fairly flavorless, and the vegetables tasted a bit sub-par, like they were old or frozen. &#160;The nan, samosas, and rice were well-cooked, though.If you're ever in Pittsburgh try the Taste of India there, and you'll see why I'm so disappointed. I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with Taste of India.On one hand, they lace their butter chicken with crack, which is likely why I continue to come back. &#160;On the other hand, I can feel the extra pounds I'm undoubtedly gaining from consuming said crack-laced butter chicken...usually around my tummy and hips...so I try and not go back often.Also, it's interesting to me that no matter what we say, we wind up with some sort of dessert "on the house". &#160;The words "no thanks, I'm full"? &#160;It's a moot point, kids. &#160;You might as well be speaking Swahili.HOWEVER...interestingly, in a more recent trip (with the trip before that being a good several months ago), we noticed that the tastes of the dishes had changed - a little more cinnamon and spice in the entrees, the rice was WAY BETTER, etc. &#160;Also, instead of the little dry peanut thing that they always plopped in front of us as a complimentary dessert, we got a scoop of what we finally decided was pistachio ice cream (or ice cream with pistachios) and a drizzle of what we guessed to be a mango sauce.This was SO GOOD. &#160;After the spice and salt in the meal, something cool and sweet and creamy was PERFECT. &#160;But really, if you're going to serve complimentary desserts, advertise it. &#160;Seriously. The food is always great. I typically order the Rogan Josh with vegetables and their delicious spiced potato naan. Only once did my food come with a slight metallic flavor mixed in.Why 3 stars? It's so crowded and busy you could lose an arm in there. A huge staff of overworked, overstressed employees working at a feverish pace. The building seemed to be half as big as it needed to be for the number of people crammed in it. The cashier was pounding away like crazy on his calculator to get everyone out the door. Meanwhile the kitchen staff was dishing up rush hour dinner for both Taste of India AND Cedar's down the road! Yes, they make the food for two restaurants. The manager (owner?) at Cedar's told me so.The only complaint I could mention about the food was that it came a little cold.*** TIPS: If you go, order the cheap chai with free refills! My Seattle-foo is growing, and with it my lore of local restaurants.This one I love. It a bit crowded and tends to get hot. There are a billion servers, and language has never been an issue. Tends to attract a huge college crowd (like-ohmigawd! you won't believe what pricilla said about you!), but I like it anyway.Things to get: Tikka Marsala is delicious (though strangely lacking in meat), the chai is good, the hummus is pretty alright. The rice is delicious. The Gooollllab-JAMIN (...golden donuts?) are awesome as well.Things to avoid: The meat-filled bread, any other beverage, some of the lamb is sketchy, and the sponge filled with bleach.It's delicious, but kind of pricy, so plan accordingly. Tied with Maharaja for my favorite Indian food in Seattle (and I guess since Maharaja is in West Seattle, Taste of Seattle is #1). You are squished in ToI like a sardine, but the food is excellent. The menu has a lot of options not available at other places (I don't consider a plus or minus, since I tend to order the same 3 things at all Indian Restaurants -- Bhindi Masala, Chana Masala or Vegetables Vindaloo). The restroom is not somewhere you would want to hang out for a long period of time, but that's okay because hanging out in any restroom isn't really my scene anyway.Also, Taste of India coupons are in the Entertainment book so you can totally do the buy one get one free meal thing. Let's play a game. It's called: can you drink all of your water/chai before they are there to fill up your glass? It's hard to do. I love coming here and eating Chicken Tikka Masala with garlic naan. Great service, usually very quick. Very consistent food. A little on the mild side when it comes to spice, but I don't really have a problem with that.Plus, they usually bring out a complimentary treat at the end.I do think it's weird that (as other reviewers have mentioned) they sponge your table off while you're still sitting there. I suppose this helps to have a quick turnover, but still. Wait the extra two minutes until I've gotten up and left. The food is yummy. &#160;All the food we have had is excellent. &#160;That being said, the owner is slimy (no really, I can't stand the guy). &#160;The employees seem over worked and the place is packed. &#160;The service is spotty at times. The food here tastes just like Cedars down the street... hmmm interesting. So, I asked owner. &#160;They are the relatives of the Cedars people and looks like they are using the same recipes.... which are greasy, bland and the most boring Indian food. Ditto, best Indian in Seattle. Yum. &#160;Taste of India is soooo goooood. &#160;The garlic naan is large enough to split... paneer tikka masala is my favorite... hot chai and the mango shake are both very tasty. &#160;The owner is really really nice (my boyfriend used to go here a long time ago, and he remembered his name), he always gets us a good seat right away even if the place is packed, and he always gives us complementary dessert. &#160;He knows everyone who comes in there. &#160;That said, the place is usually packed in the evenings, and sometimes people bring in huge groups or noisy kids and that can be annoying. A year ago I tried Taste of India for the first time and absolutely loved it. &#160;The food was so good and the price was reasonable. &#160;If I was posting reviews on Yelp a year ago I would have given this place 5 stars. &#160;So, what has changed? &#160;Well, I recently came here for lunch with a friend. &#160;We had wanted to try a different Indian restaurant in the U-District but unfortunately they were closed. &#160;I still had a hankering for Indian food so I suggested Taste of India. &#160;I figured you couldn't lose with Taste of India. &#160;Boy was I wrong. &#160;When we entered the restaurant we were seated right away and given Dinner menus (it was 1pm). &#160;I thought it was strange at first and asked my friend, "Why'd they give us dinner menus?" &#160;And then thought after, "Maybe they ran out of Lunch menus?" My friend also mentioned seeing others with dinner menus too. &#160;But we stayed anyways. So, we ended up ordering the Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Coconut Curry, Garlic Naan and two Chais. &#160;The food was good of course and our water and chais were constantly filled. &#160;But after we finished our meal, it all went downhill. &#160;When we finished our food we requested our bill and had to wait a very long time for it. &#160;I saw the wait staff go around several times filling waters and chais, checking on other patrons, and taking orders but still no bill. &#160;While we were waiting for our bill, the bus boy even came over and wiped down our table with us still sitting there. &#160;When our bill finally arrived after a 20 minute wait, I took a look at the bill and the total was $36. &#160;We ended up tipping so total spent was $41 for two (I know we shouldn't have tipped but we did). It was obvious that they charged us dinner prices for our lunch. &#160;I understand that food prices are up everywhere but a $4 increase per entree? That seems a bit extreme to me. &#160;But it gets better...So my friend and I start to put our credit cards on the bill and out of nowhere one of the wait staff just swoops by and snatches up our cards and the bill. &#160;I had barely even laid my card on the table and he snatched it up so fast. &#160;That was just so rude! &#160;The food is good here but I don't think I will be returning here for awhile. &#160;The good food is not worth all of this. This place is so overly staffed it is ridiculous! Every time you take a sip of water they are there refilling it! Some might say they are being attentive I say they are neurotic. Overall the food was good, I haven't decided if I will go back or not yet. My decision will be solely based on whether or not I want to drink my whole glass of water before it is refilled! I've been eating here for years. The service at this restaurant is as effective and attentive as that of any in town. The professionalism of their staff is on par with that of much more expensive restaurants such as Palisade or Ray's. The food is always spot on, not super authentic or anything, but it consistently gives the people what they want. The owner takes care of regulars, and he's almost always around; hooking it up with rasmalai and chai to enjoy after the plates at the table have been cleaned. This place gets packed but like I said the staff can handle, I've rarely seen a cup or glass come close to being emptied. Best Indian food I've had in the Pacific NW. &#160;The true mark of a good Indian restaurant is good naan. &#160;And this place has great naan. &#160;Piping hot and huge straight out of the oven.
So I must admit based on all the reviews and what other people have told me I came in here with some pretty high expectations and I must say I have never been soo underwhelmed in my life. &#160;The service was curt and indifferent, the facility was an upgraded hole in the wall, and the cheap prices are the ONLY thing that's keeping me from giving this ONE star. &#160;That's right ONE star.Seriously, for those people who say the food is good.... you all need to get out more. &#160;The pho broth basically lacked any apparent flavor. &#160;The noodles were plentiful, but if I'm eating noodles with a tasteless broth it really doesn't matter how much noodles you give me because it'll still be tasteless. &#160;And yes I may be an asian food snob, but when it comes to ethnic cuisine you really need to abide by one simple rule if the people of that ethnicity are the ones there its probably pretty good. &#160;This place was full of people of shall we say a more european decent and my friend and I were the only asians there. &#160;Nuff said.So if you're looking for a good bowl of pho definitely check out I Love Pho (they have three locations) instead, its a little more expensive, but the broth is much better. &#160;That said, if you prefer bland broth and tasteless noodles I have some styrofoam you can come over and munch on as an appetizer.PS THEY ONLY TAKE CASHPSS can someone tell me why all the bench cushions are ripped and somehow they find it okay to not fix them???? best pho in the area Not impressed. Place seemed dirty. Staff were down right rude to our group, and kept forgetting some of our orders. Tables were filthy. Broth was bland. We won't be back. Granted, Than Bros. was my first pho experience, and their pastry puffs are just awesome! &#160;They're not a bad choice by any means, but I always feel like I'm being forced to order and eat at a drive through window. &#160;I wouldn't recommend coming here if you want to eat in a relaxing atmosphere or spend time having a conversation with your friends. &#160;A little bit dirty, table cloths and walls could be cleaned more often. &#160;But, need to eat fast and don't want drive through, they're the next best thing. Wow, this place is a dump inside. Be sure to hit the can before you go because you DO NOT want to find yourself in the nastiest potty this side of Hanoi. That said, the Pho is great. Probably the best in Seattle. And the prices are dang cheap. When it's raining, the pho calls to me. Noooodlles. Brooooth. Weeee're waaaarm.I'll admit - it's a ugly restaurant. Last time we went, my booth seat was ripped with its spongy innards gaping out at me. But it wasn't dirty, mind you. I've never been to a Than Brothers that was dirty.What I like most about the Than Brothers (Ballard and Capitol Hill) is the predictability. The small chicken pho is always exactly the same, and that's the way I like it, thank you very much. Bite-size pieces of chicken, a perfect knot of noodles, happy little green onions floating in a not-too-salty chicken broth. Add in some bean sprouts and some Siraracha, and I'm good to go. The cream puff is a bonus.All in all, it's good (and cheap!) enough for me on a cold and rainy night when the idea of making my own soup is unappealing. I just moved back to Seattle from Boston...one stop I had to make was Than Bros in Ballard. &#160;I had a hard time finding good Pho in Boston- but I can find it here in Ballard, that rich mecca of asian heritage- er, wait...When I go to Than, I'm not looking for ambience- I'm looking for a piping hot pot of beef, noodles, plum sauce, basil, sprouts, chili sauce and lime...and that's precisely what I get. &#160;I don't mind that the waitstaff never refills my water, or the place has a wierd bready smell. &#160;No, I'm looking for something to slurp and to top off my meal &#160;with a cream puff, and Than does it for me. Delish~Free cream puff! &#160;And the key is to go with a friend who doesn't like cream puffs so you get 2 for free! &#160;And if you're a real piggy you can buy 3 for a whopping $1.25.Don't be scammed by their "size chart". &#160;My friend Erin and I decided that no matter what size bowl you order, they bring you the same amount. &#160;Just smile and point to the one you want and eat your free cream puff! &#160;Cash only too, no check buster I have been to this location several times; some take-out, some dine-in. &#160;I vote for take-away at this place.We went there the other day for lunch. &#160;My pho got to our table in about a minute and a half. &#160;No complaints about service; it's quiet and quick. &#160;The food is good for the price. &#160;Great on a rainy day.However, they could use some new booth cushions. &#160;Both of our seats were worn out. &#160;The foam in the cushion wasn't just visible... enough of it was exposed that it was disturbing. &#160;We're not talking just cracked vinyl here. &#160;Had I been sitting in the middle of the cushion, my butt would have been riding the dirty foam. &#160;That said: if you're looking for quick, cheap, filling food around Ballard - this is your place. &#160;Just get it to go, or choose a table with chairs. Good enough. I ordered a medium, so I'd have food for tomorrow, too. The broth is bland without half a cup of hoisin sauce, and a liberal dose of sriracha (aka Hot Cock) as well. $6.36 for two meals can't really be beat. I considered an all-pho diet, in order to save myself a bunch of money on groceries. It seems like I go to the grocery store, spend $75, and have nothing to eat. I know I'll eat the pho. Making decisions about my food based only on price doesn't sound prudent though, and I quickly did away with the APD (all pho diet) craze I was about to launch. One thing I love about pho is that you can eat until you can barely move, pee a couple times in the next hour, and be back to comforable waistband territory with little effort. Which leaves one to wonder, is it really food? Sure it is. just don't count on it to be more than it really is, which is a bowl of very hot water with some noodles in it, maybe some meat or tofu, and not much else.It will make you feel better if you're heartbroken, stressed out, sick or otherwise miserable. Than Brothers is the bar by which Seattle Pho is measured, in my book. &#160;This is their newest location, in addition to Greenlake, Cap Hill, and the University District.Sure, the ambiance isn't so great. &#160;But you don't come to a Pho place expecting that - how do you think they can keep the prices so low?Their signature cream puffs are brought to your table before you eat, and I usually eat them as an appetizer. &#160;You can always get more to go, 3 for $1.25. &#160;Get a whole tray on your way to a party, everyone will love you!I've only ordered the chicken and veggie pho, but I've always had good quality chicken. &#160;Try a iced vietnamese coffee too. &#160;This place is a must when you are getting over a cold. &#160;Just don't sneeze on Buddha. The best Pho I've ever tried! Any type that you order, don't forget to get some extra meatballs! The broth tastes so good that I always eat/drink it all. For a cheap price, you'll eat until you almost burst! They have four sizes: small, medium, large, and extra large. The extra large size is so big that I'm always reminded of a basin whenever I see it, but it only costs about $6-$7. Food comes out really fast. So if you're really hungry, Pho Than Bro is the best place to go to. They serve you big portion of food in about 2-3 minutes after you place your order. Moreover, they give you a really tasty cream puff as an appetizer for free! If you want more, though, you gotta buy 'em. Pho is perfect for cold weather, but even during summer, they have air-con inside so you'll be able to enjoy your Pho in any season.Downside: The place is not so clean. Sometimes the tables are sticky. And they only accept cash.Some warnings: 1)Pho is famous for its distinct, onion-like smell. I don't know if people actually like the smell, but I don't, however big my love for the food is. So, I'd reccommend that you go there wearing your not-so-favorite shirt, because you'll have to wash them right away. I wouldn't want to go to important meetings or parties right after I ate at a Pho restaurant, because I think people will think that I have a really bad body odor.2) I usually take the bus. If you like the broth like I do, don't attempt to run to catch a bus after you eat. Your stomach will be all jiggly with broth. I am a big guy and I can eat a lot but I can just barely finish a small bowl here. &#160;They are HUGE. &#160;The Pho is good particularly when you add the rooster sauce and brown goo. &#160;Ummmmm brown goo. &#160;The price is great downright cheep actually. &#160;What more you ask....free cream puffs, oh my. &#160;There is no atmosphere to this place seems like a stale lunch room cafeteria. &#160;And there isn't really any service. &#160;They take your order bring it in no time and that is it. &#160;If you go in expecting more, then you will be disappointed. &#160;Enjoy the Pho and creampuffs cause that is all there is. i'm pretty surprised at how low some of the ratings are, especially those that seem to factor in atmosphere/ambiance or the service as a major flaw. &#160;it makes me think that seattlites have no idea what "dive" really means because, while the ballard location isn't "charming", it's a freaking pho house; &#160;it's clean enough &amp; all the chairs &amp; tables match. &#160;the server not chatting you up? &#160;maybe it's because english is his/her 2nd language &amp; hell, they've got noodle soup to make &amp; serve. &#160;personally, i love how fast our order is taken &amp; our food is served (&amp; they've never gotten our order wrong). i also think the soup is pretty good, although i will admit to getting the same thing everytime. &#160;lots of noodles, lots of meat &amp; i garnish the hell out of it. &#160;to me, that's what pho's about. Edible. Adequate.Not stellar. Probably the least best of the chain.Hate all the mirrors. Service not great.Broth not favorful, however, veggies were fresh.Good creampuffs. Despite the last two positives, this place does not live up to the mediocrity of its siblings. This place is cheap, tasty and has great service. I have found that some hole in the wall places have sketchy Pho ingredients.... Wondering it the meat is old smelling it over and over before leaving hungry. But Than Brothers is always fresh and clean!
I was itchin' to leave this place before the pho even got to the table, and it got to the table in under 2.3 minutes! Generally, when I go to a restaurant I don't care about anything but the food. Atmosphere is nice and all, but food is why I'm at a restaurant. So, it was odd when I wanted to bail out, drive home, and not look back; all before the food arrived.The pho was alright, nothing to complain about, except the chicken was dry and stringy. And, since they serve nothing but pho it's not like I could distract myself with a tasty side dish.So, no it wasn't the soup that was the real problem. The real problem was the atmosphere, or complete lack thereof. You could overhear each tables conversations since there was strangely no background noise. The service was more than brisk with the waiter asking us what we wanted before our butts even hit our seats. The lighting was some hideous florescent flickering that made everyones pores seem way larger than they needed to be. Overall not a good way to enjoy a bowl of soup.If you like the soup, by all means, go, close your eyes, enjoy your soup. It's not bad.
Sonrisa is me and my wife's favorite mexican restaurant. &#160;They aleays have fresh local ingredients. &#160;Their happy hour offers some great deals. &#160;They offer a great selection of delicious margaritas. &#160;When its sunny, sitting out on the sidewalk is great to people watch and have some great homemade chips and salsa in the sun. &#160;The atmosphere inside and out is great and the staff is always friendly. &#160;The only downside, &#160;our favorite item om the menu, mexican caprese salad is off the menu. Service was great, but the food was so blah! We had there lunch specials, which for Mexican lunch specials were not on the cheap end so I was expecting something tastier. My enchiladas were ok, edible but not that tasty. The sauce was lackluster. I also had the green chile soup which was so salty and bland I couldn't finish it. I'm sure there are more edible things on the menu, but overall this place was a bust. ** On a positive note, the margarita was delicious. I went in here for an early dinner from 4 to 5pm hoping to find a place to work and eat for an hour while waiting for my daughter to finish a class. The food was just ok (was glad it was happy hour cheap) but the fact that I felt rushed out of the mostly empty restaurant every 2 minutes makes it somewhere I will never go back to. &#160;I asked the bartender when I sat down if it was ok to sit and eat and work for an hour...if it wasn't they should have said so. Disappointing. I love this place. I live and work close by so it's frequently visited by me. The service is great, the food is yummy and the happy hours are reasonable. Except for parking at U Village, I have no complaints. Thanks for the consistently friendly service!
This place is between a lot of things I go to. I have been here under every reincarnation. I was here when it was Hunan Springs. It has been here a while and while it changed hands many times none of the seats have ever been replaced. Most people &#160;here were families, teenagers,and &#160;men on their lunch breaks . My dad likes going here- he buys a lot of my meals. So there &#160;you go. I do like being able to choose whatever I want and double down on &#160;chicken skewers when I skip breakfast. The waitress was super fast and everything got refilled rather quickly. It's massively inexpensive for "real" food. As in it couldn't be cheaper unless you went to the dollar menu. But their selection isn't great and &#160;choosing a seat is a little like Russian roulette because a lot of their booths have lose seats that flung me forward whenever I wanted to scoot up. I went here about a year ago, and I promised I'd NEVER return.Tea's pre-sweetened from a fountain (blech!), buffet is crappy, and the booths feel like they were retrieved from the dump. &#160;AVOID. Came here on Christmas eve. For 11 bucks and it's location, I didn't expect the food to be the best and I didn't expect there'd be many options. Because it was Christmas, I was wrong about both. I thoroughly ENJOYED this place, the food was amazing and fresh, SO MUCH to choose from. They even had crab legs and lobster! I was annoyed my mom kept rushing to get out, because I wanted to sit there and try everything... TWICE! Friendly staff and good food at fast food prices. Sure the building can do with a remolding, but for what you get and the price you pay Jumbo Buffet is good value.
I'm a local (my college building is just across the street of this restaurant) and I would like to rate Banana Leaf for 2 stars only for the following reasons:1. The taste of their dish is not consistent. As a real frequent visitor I can tell you sometimes their dish is salty, sometimes oily, sometimes too dry. It is not stable. When you are lucky you get really good food. And you know their price is probably the best on the whole University Way. But when you are unlucky...especially at their peak time...wow, frequent visitors all know what "wow" means.2. the owner is obviously trying too hard to save money. Tell me, how can a restaurant only hire 2 waitress (one of them has to do cashier work) at peak time when it has over 30 seats/18 tables in its interior?Incredible, again. &#160;(locals know what im talking about. We hate to go there at noon time. It is extremely slow)3. I dont know this is a cultural thing or what....a waitress once asked me for higher tip. The same waitress once asked my friend for tip before he did the tipping action. (when my friend put his cash back to his wallet and was thinking how much to tip, the waitress said to him: "tip please".)Unbeleivable! Who trained this waitress? Is this appropriate? Two words: HAPPY HOUR.Seriously. 6 dollar pad thai, pad see ew, drunken noodles, etc? Their dishes have generous servings, taste great, and have just the right amount of spice for me. Clean, vibrant atmosphere, and decent service.Only warning though: pay in CASH for happy hour. Don't get me wrong. This place isn't disgustingly terrible, but there are SO many thai places not only in the Greater Seattle area, but specifically in the U-District. Competition is tough and if you aren't particularly memorable, then..... Well...The food was ok. It wasn't that good. I got Pad Thai with chicken. It was really mediocre, and I had a bunch left over, but I didn't even want to box it because if it wasn't that good fresh, the thought of eating it day old was even less appealing to me.PROS:- It's nice and clean- Staff is pleasant and friendly enough- Very convenient for UW students, particularly the dorm kids I'd assume. CONS:- Food was seriously whatever. Forgettable. If not forgettable, then memorable in the sense that it really wasn't that goodI only went because I went with a younger crowd-- a bunch of UW students still living in the Udistrict. I'd skip out next time. They seemed to not mind their food, probably because they don't often venture out of the Ud to find better. I know that for me personally..I'm not paying that much for a plate of sub-par pad thai again. Super spicy pad thai? Oh, yes.Even as a spice enthusiast, I can tell you that their 5-star scale is RIGGED. As in, if you usually get 3 star, you should get 1, maybe 2 on a good day. That being said, I usually get 5, and the first time I had a 5-star pad thai from here I thought I was going to die... Since then, I've gotten accustomed to the ridiculous spiciness of the dish (that should tell you how often I've been... I AM a UW student after all) and I'm addicted.Their happy hour cash deal for 5.99 is a steal since they also give you a huuuuuuge portion, but if you're eating in, be prepared for pretty poor service. They're crazy busy, and severely understaffed during those hours. Also, their chairs are way too low set for their tables... It's awkward. Get take out!Edit: I should also note that my last few visits to Banana Leaf have been unimpressive, and therefore I no longer find it worth while to walk all the way down the Ave &#160;for 5.99 pad thai. I may swing by out of convenience every once in a while, but I certainly won't go as much as I did two years ago. Meh. it's good, not great. &#160;it's close to campus. &#160;their curries are meh. &#160;pad thai is meh. &#160;their thai iced teas are meh. &#160;their seating capacity is meh. &#160;the amount of people in there at any given time makes me say "meh". &#160;it's meh.it's food. &#160;it ranks a little off the "meh" median and onto the "pretttttttyyyyyyyyy preeettyyyyyyyy good" (david cross reference) side. The Pad See Ew and BBQ pork are worthy of a try but the spice level is inconsistent a 3 star sometimes tastes like a 4 or 2... etc. but overall the food is delicious, I do recommend giving this place a try! Really great Phad Thai in a relaxed atmosphere. &#160;Friendly service and reasonably priced. As a local U.W student living in the U-district I've tired &#160;just about &#160;every Thai restaurant on the ave. I'm giving Banana Leaf a 5 star rating because it has NEVER let me down. I always get the combo special, &#160;two entrees for 8.99!!! Definitely the best deal, oh and yes they're full sized entrees! My chicken phad thai and thai fried rice are always outstanding and the Pad See Ew is to die for! The dishes tend to lean on the spicier side so if you order two star you might end up with a three star dish. They are definitely understaffed but I have always received friendly, great &#160;service; my water glass is never empty. The neatest thing in my opinion is the server always seems to recognize me asking "where have we been" and remembers what I order! &#160;If that isn't outstanding service I don't know what is. Banana leaf's food, atmosphere and service is excellent!
This place is great. $5.99 entrees during happy hour, 4-9.30, cash only, so that you're able to escape having only spent a total of $8 and carrying a full takeout box because their portions are enormous. The service has always been fast and courteous, although they are a bit slow at times about water refills. Last time, we grabbed a pitcher from the bar (a big group of us was seated in the back bar) and they seemed to get the hint.The food is consistently good. The pad thai is delicious, as is the tom yum noodle soup. Spice level is hearty, so consider ordering a star below your normal pick. I've never had a dish here I didn't like. The food was ok, acceptable but not great. Service was mediocre, and the staff i feel is kind of incompetent. I had the phad thai and it wasn't spectacular. It was a bit on the salty side, the color of it is way different than most other thai places, I think they use soy sauce, where as most thai places don't.On top of that, they have a "cash only" happy hour, this is the part that ticked me off, because they post outside "happy hour from x-pm to x-pm" but when you go in and sit down, it says CASH ONLY for happy hour prices. Bait and switch! I wished I knew about this place when I was still knee-deep at UW. I found out about this place a few months before graduations. 4-8pm HH and all day Sunday I think? $5.99 for Thai food? SOLD! It's pretty solid Thai food, service is nice albiet disorganized sometimes, very cramped and not good for large groups. Cash only for HH prices... two noodle dishes came out to $13.18 pre-tip. YUM!I'd come back if I happen to be in the area, but sadly I'm not. One of my favorite affordable Thai joints in town! My favorite dish here is the Pad Kee Mao. I'm pretty picky when it comes to the right squishiness of noodles but they've got it down pat. &#160;As mentioned by countless others, be sure to come here for their happy-hour 6$ specials for (almost) all entrees with cash, which seems to be pretty much active all the time. It doesn't hurt that they've got a nice sense of decor and a chill music mix to give the right atmosphere. This is my go-to place on the Ave for consistently delicious Thai food. Unlike many of the others, I have yet to hear complaints about heath code violations or general gross-outs while dining. This place was a little-known gem when it first opened 2 years ago but it has now been discovered due to the high quality food and large portions for such a reasonable price. They have even extended their $5.99 entree happy hour (cash only) to 4-9:30pm I think. The only downside is that with their well-deserved success, the rushes have become crazy and the small staff sometimes has a difficult time keeping up with the demand. Unless I'm meeting friends for food I tend to order out during happy hour. The pad thai and the pad see ew are equally delicious but I tend to favor the pad see ew with fried tofu. There is something about the proportion of noodle to veggies to tofu to egg to spice that can't be beat! Also- if you're absolutely starving or can't decide on just one thing the combo plate is the way to go- 2 entrees of slightly smaller proportions for $9. Satisfying and plenty of leftovers for that midnight snack or tomorrow's lunch. Good thai food. But &#160;very awkward with the whole pay with cash for happy hour, only because they ran out of change. He couldn't break a 20 so i was scrounging to pay 6.59 (total for pad thai with tax, not bad!). I wasnt able to tip because I had no more money. &#160;Next time I'll bring my card, although it is a bummer to have to pay extra for each entree when using a card.Good food. I almost gave 3 stars but I felt bad because the service was good and so was the food. Maybe because it was 6pm on Sunday night. I've passed by this place many times but haven't dined until very recently. &#160;The menu has a decent selection of curries, noodles, etc. for good prices. &#160;Happy hour rates are cash only. &#160;The interior is bright and cheery and wait staff sufficiently nice.I went in for an early dinner of Pad see ew, which was tasty. &#160;My only complaint is that the food arrived at an unnecessarily long interval between my friend's dish and mine. &#160;It wasn't busy, so I hope this isn't a bigger problem during peak hours. "Great food takes time"4 stars. And I'm not talking about my spice level. The food at Banana Leaf is delicious. The pad thai comes near perfect all the time ( they forgot a lime one time, but no biggie). I can see that the cooks at Banana pay attention to detail for every dish that goes out. Massive props for a place that's consistently busy.Your patience will be rewarded if you decide to dine here. Tips:-pay with cash- avoid the lunch and dinner time rush-prepare to wait at least 15 minutes or more (yes, I timed it) I have been there once for dinner. It was very crowded and I had to wait for about 15 minutes for the food. The staff was friendly but the service was only okay. I usually order to go here and the waitress is very helpful. Most of the time the food I order is ready when I arrive in about 15mins. My favorite dish here is the cashew chicken and the Vietnamese vermicelli with bbq pork. &#160;I would say the portion is small for the price you pay for the Vietnamese bbq pork dish, but the taste makes up for it. The vegetables are usually fresh which is a bigggg plus. The thai food is decent compared to other thai restuarants on the ave. Many times the pad thai taste a little dry to me.
Read as 2.5 stars...it has HH pricing! It's an OK restaurant that turns into a great spot for college students because of the Thai food at Happy Hour pricing. However, don't let that fool you, as it's only for students who are paying with cash (as far as I remember) so if you don't have cash on you and have a credit card, happy hour prices there are negated and coming here for other than maybe its relative location to Condon Hall (late class), or if you're a freshman living in the dorms of Terry/Lander, is basically useless as there are much better, albeit more expensive places to eat excellent Thai food on the Ave.SERVICE: The service here could be better......I take it back, the service needs to improve 10 fold. But the reason why I'm giving it a *** rating is because I like the food here so +1 * . The service here however is absolutely horrendous............they for some reason have the smarts to hire 1.......................I repeat....ONE &#160;waiter/waitress to serve almost the entire place which seats about 45-50 people. In other words what that means to you, the customer, is long periods of waiting, even for take out orders...I find myself oftentimes just going up to the counter to serve myself water.Bottom line: Good for happy hour if you eat that early, otherwise don't waste your time. If you're a freshman go to your 1101 in that area and or hit up the 8. I go here rarely. Only if I'm in that area for happy hour and I'm absolutely craving this Banana Leaf I'll consider going but even at that I'd rather go to Little Thai which is much more consistent in spiciness, flavor, quality, etc. &#160;^^ First off, this is coming from someone who dislikes many restaurants on the ave... so it should mean something!We came in here with low expectations, but thai food with happy hour prices?! Who could resist giving this place a try. Typically, the dishes are $6.99; during happy hour 4pm-8pm weekdays and all day weekends all entrees are $5.99. This is definitely a steal for thai food! Oh, it is also cash only in order to get the happy hour discount! It isn't posted on the website, but there is a sign and the waitress tells you up front. No funny business! Okay so the food is cheap and the waitresses are friendly... on to the food!We ordered a pad thai chicken (4 stars) and drunken noodles w/ fried tofu aka pad kee mao (4 stars) and both were surprisingly well put together! The pad thai was tasty and the spice was perfect. The chicken was a bit dry for my taste, but there are other meat choices. Asked for extra lime, she brought it without problems. The drunken noodles were very tasty and the tofu was perfectly fried. The vegetables included bell peppers, onion, cabbage, mushrooms, carrots, broccoli... which is much more than other thai restaurants. It was a pleasant surprise. Both dishes were a very good size for the price they were and also came with some rice. We are pretty particular about our thai food and this place definitely passed!People were nice, food was good, price was right, space was a bit tight and didn't get much of a "thai" feel, but overall it was a pretty solid visit. Will definitely be back again and hopefully they keep it solid.Two dishes for $13.18 after tax + tip is a steal... &#160;give them a try :) I've definitely experienced better Thai food (2-star), but overall I felt "OK" (3-stars) about Banana Leaf Cafe.For the most part, I think Banana Leaf knows it's clientele and it's not trying to impress anyone with it's cuisine. Located on the corner of NE 40th and University, Banana Leaf is surrounded by University buildings. Thus, the restaurant has a consistent customer base as a function of their convenient location. As a result, I think much of the way Banana Leaf works is a function of the demands put upon them by these loyal customers. Usually, this means fast meals (that at least are average on the tastiness).Banana Leaf creates freshly made meals fast and the taste is average. It's great if you're trying to catch a meal between classes or during a lunch break and you want something freshly prepared.I've ordered the swimming rama, pad thai, and pad see ew here, and I've appreciated them all. For most of the dishes, you get to chose the type of meat you would like to include (i.e., chicken, beef, seafood, or tofu meat!). Each meal comes with a cup of rice and salad garnish on the side. I've also had their fresh rolls which are pretty standard. Nothing out of the ordinary. The portions are appropriately sized; they don't give so much that you'll have to goody bag some of it.They have an extended happy hour on the weekdays (4pm-close) and weekends (12pm-8pm) that makes this place more worth it, but you have to pay cash in order to get the happy hour price.Overall, Banana Leaf is okay. Perfect for those times where you can't really commit to a complete sit down experience, but you aren't necessarily on-the-go either. Good lunch spot, and today I noticed a sign saying if you pay cash at dinner (4-8 PM) you get a "happy hour" price of $5.99. If you use your plastic, you pay full price, which is still mostly around $6.99, with a few slightly more expensive items.Of the Thai places on the Ave, this is one of the best, and by far the cleanest and most well-lit (with two walls of windows looking out on the street. The menu is limited to about 20 items, mostly sort of "lunch plate" style items (entree with a scoop of rice) with a few combos and appetizers. They have all the Thai classics and when I order 3-star spicy, they gave me actual spicy food (not the whitegirl 3-star I get in some places). Service is quick and friendly. Seriously. This place is so good! I still have yet to try anything other than their pad thai because I love it so much! Maybe next time; you never know!Also, EVERY time I come here, I run into somebody I know. It's uncanny.I would come here even if it wasn't so convenient to campus. The food is good, the service is quick and friendly, and it's a cute little cafe. One negative thought: They could &#160;use some shades for the window. The sun is a little too shiny-in-your-eyes sometimes. very good. got combo meal and i like that u can choose whichever 2 dishes u want from the menu. i had pad see iw and cashew tofu - both were excellent - although i did ask for no mushrooms and onions and they left them in - allergic to them but i picked them out. service was very fast. took off one star for leaving in stuff i didnt want and for the cramped area. sorry other people got yelled at. my girl was nice. a lot of people were getting take out and i could see why since u are practically sitting on the persons lap next to u. Yummy thai for a great price. &#160;Got the combo meal. &#160;I had panang curry with tofu and phad thai with tofu. &#160;Both were really tasty. &#160;Also the portions were great for the price - I just finished the leftovers and they left me wanting to go back! Good prices, decent food, inconsistent spiciness (i.e. when I say 4 stars, I want it to actually be at least somewhat spicy), weird seating.Why only 2 stars? First, we didn't need another thai place in the U-District. Second, we especially didn't need one at the expense of a place that served some great sandwiches and breakfasts!They do still serve breakfast here. Props for that and the fact that it is reasonably priced. However, when I ordered the veggie scramble, it was advertised as containing tomato, onion, and spinach, I believe, but came with onion, carrots, broccoli, and tomato -- the veggies they use in their pad thai and other dishes. It even had the star-cut carrots. It actually wasn't that bad, but not as advertised. Also, only one refill on the coffee.There are better options for both thai food and breakfast in the area. I think this place survives because it is cheap and because lazy students and faculty get to it before they get elsewhere. Prices: Deserves 5 stars.Quality: 3-4 (But again, the prices are reasonable)Taste: 4 (4-5 for the price bracket)No, this isn't the best Thai restaurant in Seattle, but it is my favorite (as well as many of my friend's) on the ave. I'd recommend the pad-see-ewe and tom yum. This is probably my favorite Thai food on the Ave. &#160;While I won't claim the food is the best around (3 stars generally), the value is great. I tend to only eat there for the happy hour 3-8 pm (5.99 entrees). Service is good too, and it's really close to campus (the closest place to where I &#160;work).5 stars for music selection. The first time I sat down to eat here, they were playing the entire The Campfire Headphase album by Boards of Canada (one of my very favorites). I said something to the waiter, and he was like "uhhh.. okay?". Must have been the cook staff. Other times I've been there I've heard OK Computer and some other really great albums. I have tried several different Thai restaurants on the ave, and this one is by far my favorite. I love love love their pad see ew and thai tea. I absolutely love the waitresses, they are always so nice and cheerful!The only downfall is that during happy hour, you must pay with cash in order to get the happy hour prices. I rarely ever have cash on me, which means regular menu prices. Banana leaf is great for college students who live in Terry/Lander. While I was living there, I was a regular because it was almost just across the street. LOVE their Pad See Ew!! Tried all the places on the Ave and it's the only place that's not too oily to give you that after thai food acid reflux. The portions are great for the price especially if you come durning Happy Hour! ONLY $6!! (if you pay cash)Favorite: Pad See Ew, thick shredded rice noodle and less sweet than the Pad Thai :)Darn to try: Green Curry, super good! even better if you get the combo so you can get pad thai too!Note: They aren't as spicy as other restaurants so add a couple stars to what even you order if you want hot!A Must Eat on the Ave! Clean, friendly, and great ambiance! Banana Leaf is not really authentic Thai food - but don't let that get you down. I personally think it's the best amongst the bunch of Americanized Thai restaurants near UW. And it has $1 off during happy hour if you pay with cash.My favorite is probably the Drunken Noodles or the Rad Nah. Yes, they are a little bit sweet but not overly sweet like some other UW Thai restaurants are prone to. For $5.99 during happy hour, it's a great value. The taste will not amaze you but it's definitely more than satisfying for your typical college meal.The only complaint I have is that the spiciness is really inconsistent. They say you can order up to unlimited stars in spiciness but when I ordered 7 stars once, it was less spicy than when I ordered 5 stars. I guess they thought I was joking when I said 7 stars and made it 7 out of 10 stars. Next time I'll just say as spicy as possible to avoid confusion. And they charge excessive gratuity when you come with 5+ people but every other Thai restaurant does that too. Its not bad but I've had some ups and downs with this place. I've always gone here when I was still in UW as a college student trying to find something good to eat. The phad thai can sometimes be a hit or miss. And one time my boyfriend ordered something a pad sew ew for three stars but it came out to be the spiciest dish with red pepper flakes all over like it was above a 5 star dish. Sometimes I had mushy rice...But when its a hit the flavors are right and the spice and for the price its alright. They have their happy hour prices which is basically $1 off each dish at certain times during the weekdays and all day weekends but only if you pay with cash. Today I went for the first time in a while since I've graduated and the portions were so big!! So that's a plus! And my boyfriend's mom did enjoy the food. We ordered the fried rice and phad thai. We both liked the fried rice. The phad thai was okay, I've tasted better but it was fine. I can eat it later for another meal! Brought home the leftovers! Overall I was glad because my boyfriend's mom is a picky eater and she approved. Count me as one of those silly people who is reviewing something other than the food. &#160;In general, Thai food has gotten kind of boring in Seattle, but some of their food is pretty good. &#160;They get two stars because of their silly happy hour. &#160;I went here at 3:50PM. &#160;I could have easily sat outside for 10 minutes, but I thought that since there was no one in the restaurant, no one would care if I was there 10 minutes before happy hour prices started. &#160;Long story short, when I left, the lady said that I couldn't have happy hour prices because I came in before 4:00PM and they were very strict. &#160;Were you so strict that I won't ever come back to your restaurant? &#160;I guess so. &#160;Don't worry, I'll tell all my friends about it too. Unfortunately this place has gone downhill lately. &#160;The food is still good, but don't go there if you are in a hurry. &#160;The service leaves much to be desired and there are too many tables there. &#160;I wouldn't be surprised if they were in violation of the fire code or something. It makes me sad that I can only give them three stars. I used to really really like this place. It was convenient, super close to where I studied all the time, super good service and I could always call in to make my orders to-go and jet out of there after getting my food. Food was/is mediocre thai food, but pretty good portions. Oh, and their happy hour is great with only $5.99 for most entrees (you have to pay with cash to get this price, however)But for me, restaurants should always be consistent with their food. I know when you have more than one person making the food, which is a lot of places, it is harder to do, but lately it has been dramatically inconsistent. It is such a hit or a miss and I don't like my food playing games with me! Some days, it will be super good and other days it is soooo bland and dry. Another minor quirk, I always ask for extra lime in my to-go order and they always seem to "forget." Consistently.
This place is... meh. &#160;I went in since it is really close to my office and has reasonable prices. The service was reeeeaaallly slow and the place seemed under-staffed. I had the rama rice dish - way too greasy and not very flavorful. I asked for two stars because thai food in the u-district is usually overly hot for me, but what I got seemed cooked for an infant's palate, ie not a speck of spice. Sad. The atmosphere and decorating is nice, but they don't get points for it since the people who ran Allegro out of the space did all the work for them. It appears Allegro even left their espresso machine there. The Cafe was much better in its former reincarnation.Even though Banana Leaf is convenient, I won't be going back. It pains me that whenever a new location opens up on the Ave, it's inevitably 1 of 3 options: thai, teriyaki or pho. Really? Really?! The food is fine but the price is the true attraction here. $5.99 for ALL entrees during Happy Hour which lasts all afternoon until closing on most days. I'm all about popping in for a quick (and difficult to screw up) Thai Iced Tea for the road but save yourself the long waits for mediocre food and have something more exciting for dinner. Pad see ew was great here. Good ingredients. Cooked really well, and a modest presentation. On a 5-star scale of 'how hot', 4 or 5 you feel the kick of heat. Anything lower is really just some spices put together for flavor. It was $6.99 +tax. On the Ave, there are many Thai places. This ranks 2nd to Thai Tom. There are a lot of terrible Thai places on this block, but this is one worth checking out. Get the phad thai too. It's good, not great. Come in company of 3 or less. It's a small dainty place, but very nice. The service was great. I have a soft spot for lemon in the water. *shrugs shoulders* What can I say. Oh man, don't get me started.First, I must remove myself from knowing that this used to be the Cafe Allegro with the awesome Mexican Mochas that drove me to insane levels of hyperactivity and hummingbird-like racing pulse. I've eaten in and taken out one time each, and ordered coffee drinks twice. The first time we ate in, it was relatively new so everything looked really cute, warm, and inviting. I deviated from my usual (pad see yew) and ordered swimming rama because I wanted some peanut sauce.And it was just eh. The sauce was a bit thin and the chicken pieces were rubbery. My friend got the pad kee mow(sp?) and she thought it was just okay as well. We really went here for the curiosity factor and how it was so close to work. Service was pretty quick though.Okay fine, eating in wasn't too exciting but I didn't place my usual order. I kept this in mind.I went back to get mochas made. Once it was a guy working, and it was around NYE because it was the ONLY place open for coffee...and I got there before this huge group of like 10ppl showed up..and the mocha was terrible. It was burnt-tasting and just blah. I still drank it though. I went back a few months later and got this girl (who always seems to be on the phone, but when she sees you come in, she sets her phone down and takes care of your order)..and she actually made a pretty decent mocha! I also bought a nice fatty slice of pumpkin bread (I have to buy it if I see pumpkin seeds, another quirk). Since my piece was only sliiiightly mis-shapened (I didn't even notice), she gave it to me for half off! And the bread was still perfectly tasty. More recently, I called in a take out order of pad see yew. It would be ready in 20mins. I get there early to pay and some dude walks in after me, just as my bag is set on the counter and goes to grab it immediately. HELLO, don't touch my stuff! That is really irksome, just take a moment, confirm it IS your order, and then grab..not the reverse. Ugh.The pad see yew was better. The rice dried out somewhat, so I tossed. I left half to finish the next day. But, it was just...off. There was something different about it. It does not reheat well at ALL, and it's not like I zapped it for 10hrs.And so, to conclude, I would 1) buy a coffee drink only if the phone-talking girl is working the counter and 2) order pad see yew take out, crowd the counter so no random dude grabs your food, and then don't bother trying to keep leftovers. Service was kinda lazy but the food was decent. We ate here because it was a rare winter sunny day and we wanted to still soak in the sunlight during lunch (rather than, say, going downstairs to the cozy pub with no windows). My 2 friends and I split 1 curry dish and noodles with fried tofu, and a giyoza appetizer for lunch around 2pm, and it was enough to be full but not sick.While it's not a priority concern for me, the decor was also nicely not-too-cheezy/obnoxious, nor plastic, with nice giant leafy frond plants. I was really sad when this place took Cafe Allegro's old spot (I still dream about their tuna melts *drooool*). And when I heard it was ANOTHER Thai place, adding to the bijillion that already live on "The Ave," I was really annoyed.Then I tried it (in part because they're so close to UW where I work). Their fried tofu won me over. And unlike many many many places in Seattle, they can actually give me spicy food if I want it. (For the record, their spice level is rather inconsistent, and they have some trouble actually mixing in the spice so you'll get some spicy clumps and some non-spicy clumps). Also, the scale for spiciness is not evenly spaced. Three stars is not at all spicy, and actually a bit bland. 4 stars jumps to a nice warm level of spice (normally perfect for me). 5 stars is great for me on cold days and can make my stomach feel the spice!Sadly, I think the consistency of this place has gone down. Their fried tofu is only so-so now. And sometimes the flavors just don't hold it together. It's still better than many thai places on the ave, but I mostly go here because it's close to campus.Their menu is pretty small so it's easy to get bored of things quickly :( They don't have any good Thai salad dishes which is too bad. A good papaya salad would go a long way for me. $5.99 happy hour special is what caught my eye. &#160;The food is alright, spice level is inconsistent It's an okay place. &#160;The service was friendly, but the sunlight is really bright during dinner... kind of distracting.The food itself is light, with reasonable ingredients, but somewhat bland. &#160;It's more in the tradition of buddhist thai food than ave thai food, in that it's fairly clean and light. &#160;I personally liked the cafe allegro that was here before, but whatever. &#160;The layout and decor hasn't changed much since then, but things are definitely a bit cleaner.Still not sure what this restaurant has to do with banana leaves other than in the name. Super close to my office, so I come here very often. It's probably as solid as Thai 65, but sometimes can be super slow.It's worth eating at, but not gourmet. I like their Pad Thai, but pass on their thai iced tea - WAY to sweet! Came here for lunch for the first time today and I thought the food was pretty decent and the service was good. &#160;I ordered a 2* dish and it was spicier than I normally can handle because I ended up drinking a lot of water in order to calm the heat in my mouth. &#160;However, I did enjoy my dish. &#160;I sampled some chicken from my lunch buddy's dish and it seemed more tolerable than mine even though he had gotten a 3* dish. &#160;Maybe my noodles were cooked in a different wok right after a spicier dish. &#160;I'd come back and try it again, but I'd probably try a 1* next time around.I also found service to be very good. &#160;My water glass kept on nearing empty, but it never made it all the way because the servers kept on refilling it for me. Good service, but the food was blegh. &#160;How hard is it to get swimming rama right? &#160;Also, the music was horrible. &#160;Methinks not. Everything I've had here is good. &#160;I like the Swimming Rama and the coconut soup. &#160;The space is filled with light &amp; has natural brick walls. &#160;The wait staff is friendly. I really like this cafe style thai restaurant! most thai places in seattle are dark but this one has lots of nice natural light. It feels a little crowded during the busy times but they have a great deal for dinner...all entrees are $6 from like 4-8 or something like that. Service was fast and friendly. Something was a little off about the rice though..it made it hard to enjoy my delicious panang curry...which had onions in it btw, I found that a little strange but it was still good. Also, the fried "spring rolls" were not really my preference...there was absolutely no vegetables in them, just theses strange rice noodles.
First of all, I have to thank everyone who reviewed here, because it's the ONLY reason I went here for Happy Hour, and it was scrumptious. My friend and I are addicted to sushi, good cocktails, cheap eats, friendly staff and cool decor. Nijo had them all. Hands down. You can get happy here starting at 4, which we did shortly thereafter, starting with a Shiso Mojito and a Coconut Cosmopolitan. YUM! Before the afternoon turned too rummy, we ordered the crap out of the happy hour sushi menu. Everything was divine, and we ordered a lot since this was to be our dinner. A big yellow triangular plate arrived artistically loaded with amazing sushi. Tempura rolls, spicy tuna rolls, shiro maguro (albacore tuna) that quite literally started melting as soon as you put it in your mouth, a couple of chef's choice rolls that were better than anything we could have thought to order - by the way, &#160;always order a chef's choice in a good sushi restaurant because they'll often go out of their way to impress you, and these guys certainly did that - and fried calamari tentacles that were tender and not at all rubbery. After a couple more cocktails we ordered some more shiro maguro and a couple more things that I forget, as I'm a lightweight drinker, but were truly splendid, and that's not just the alcohol talking.Our waitress was pretty and friendly - I don't often get called a "lady" - and the service was the perfect balance of attentiveness and letting us alone to gab the afternoon away. We were really surprised though at how empty the restaurant was for a Friday afternoon, even though it was Good Friday. It was picking up a little when we left at 6-ish, but nowhere near capactiy. There's also a happy hour from 10 to midnight, maybe it picks up later. The music was great, and this is odd, but we really loved the chairs they have here. Modern cool. And almost best of all, we walked out having paid $41 plus tip for 4 cocktails and at least 8 sushi orders. I lost count. I should say waddled out because it was a lot of food. I'm going to be a regular here and I can't wait for summer to eat outside in the cute bamboo'd patio space. I've been going to this place for years and Jasmine and her staff do a wonderful job. &#160;They are extremely knowledgeable about sake and have an excellent collection. &#160;The food is wonderful and the bartenders definitely pour great drinks.Couple of things to note they have a happy hour from 4-6 pm M-F that a really good deal with cheap nigiri and featured rolls. &#160;Also if you're there definitely order their Poke.****** UPDATE 10/6**********I'm not sure what's going on, but my recent experiences have been less that great. &#160;Service has been poor and the food has taken a step downward. &#160;As a result, I've dropped my rating to 3-stars. The atmosphere is great. It has outdoor seating. It is tucked away and kind of private. It has great decor. The tempura udon is pretty good. I've had it twice. The first time I think they used the sukiyaki broth and while it was "weird" the more I ate it the more I enjoyed it. The next time I ordered it, it had the "right" broth. It was still good.I pretty much only eat tuna and cucumber rolls and the tuna rolls are so-so. The last one I had, the fish was kinda tough which was weird.The salad would be good excpet they use those damn field greens which I don't like. So, those of you who like them, will probably like the salad.The miso soup was good. What makes this place (aside from the fact that it is in a building I work in sometimes) is the atmosphere which is awesome. Nijo has one of the best happy hours in town. &#160;this includes $1 sashimi and 3$ rolls and cheap drink specials. &#160;However the quality &#160;is A+! one of my favorite places anytime of day. this little hole in the wall puts to shame alot of the more well known spots around town. even the staff is incredibly sweet!
I have been to Greece and miss the gyros so much. &#160;Usually I never get gyros because they are always a disappointment, but yesterday I went to Aladdin. &#160;I got a Lamb Gyro and it was very tasty. &#160;It was different then the ones in Greece, but it had the same flavor and delicious sauce. &#160;I will definintely be returning when I'm craving a gyro. I don't like falafels. But don't let the name deceive you, this place is very good. I tried the beef and lamb gyro. I loved it so much that I got the sauce all over me... and I didn't even care! It was very good, my boyfriend loved his too. I am not a huge gyro fan, but whenever I am craving one again, I will definitely try this place again. Great chiken gyros .Falafal is also one of the best . Perfect place to eat a lot with and still spend less :) Listen, if you want a quick bite to eat during lunch or a cheap eat for dinner this place is it! &#160;The best thing they got here is their Beef &amp; Lamb Gyro. &#160;The meat is generously portioned inside a warm pita with lettuce, tomatoes, tzatziki sauce, and their special cumin spices. &#160;The service is quick and always consistent. &#160;$5 will get you a gyro including tax. &#160;So sit and enjoy this delicious treat or take it with you while you stroll the AVE. I love this place! &#160;I was thinking about it recently, and I don't go out too often on the ave, but when I do it's almost always to here. &#160;I couldn't even remember the name of the place--just that it involved falafel.Amazingly tasty fries, awesome veggie options, and open super late. &#160;I love it. Mohammed was a nice guy... He said he will make the special gyro (read year-o, NOT jay-ro) fried rice that is the favorite of his customers. As it turned out, it was a special fried rice... pretty darn good! The gyro was awesome too. You guys should come here if you've never been. Seriously. Tasty! Oh so tasty. Priced well and friendly staff. What would I change? They could use a better eating area, and it would be nice if there were Americanized descriptions of the food so I don't feel stupid asking "what's in this one?" I adore this place! Open late and the food is GREAT! Love love love their falafels. I've tried their other stuff like grape leaf wraps, hummus, etc... not the best, but not bad either. Just go with a sandwich and fries! :) Had my first taste of aladdin during the Udistrict street fair... ordered the rice with meat. We didn't expect anything special, so we decided to split the dish amongs the 4 of us. Waited a while for the plate to come out... but when it came out.... we devoured the thing like a real carnivore!It was really good... that the next few days we had to come back and get the gyros!Yummy-licious Rockin falafel. Not too hard/not too dry. Good fries. Nice dudes running the place. Nice place to sit and chill. Good veggie/vegan options. Check it out.Pretty cheap too for all the food you get. Discovered this place on accident one fateful night in early 2006 with my new boyfriend. At the time I lived in Everett and visited the U district often to go to The Varsity to watch the latest foreign/independent film. At the time, it was the size of a hallway, two or three tables against the wall, and a bar with 6 stools. They have since taken on more space and classed it up a bit. He ordered the chicken gyro, I ordered the spanopita (spinach feta pita) and we shared a side of falafel balls. This was four years ago and I still remember how I felt when I ate my meal. Amazed that such wonderful, flavorful, savory food could come from such a hole in the wall in Seattle. The turmeric rice is the perfect complement to the wraps. The falafel s are perfectly fried.We started to go to Aladdin's every time we went to Seattle. I stuck with the Spanopita, he went to the Kofta gyro. We moved to Bellingham. Now, I long for Aladdins. Any excursion to Seattle is an opportunity for us to order our usuals. I even got my picky little brother, who eats hungry man frozen dinners almost every night, to love the food here. For the life of me. I can not comprehend why anyone would go to the likes of pita pit, when you can have authentic, delicious pitas down the road for a fraction of the cost and a taste that is exponentially superior. However, this does not mean I want them to be in the line when I come down from Bellingham. To each their own I suppose. More spanopitas for me. I am a bit of a falafel fanatic, and I am proud to report that Aladdin Falafel Cornerdoes not disappoint. I had had the falafel sandwich, a side order of hummus and I was excited that they had Vimto (it's a British black current soda very popular in the Middle East).The food was fantastic. The falafel sandwich was great, the lettuce and tomato on the sandwich had a nice dressing on them, it was like the kind of dressing you generally get on a fatoush salad. The hummus was exceptional, it had top shelf olive oil on it, a few chickpeas, some chopped parsley, and some great middle eastern spices.All around great place to get some slightly greasy middle eastern food. Whenever a group of my friends and I have a hard time deciding where to go to eat, we always choose Aladdin Falafel Corner. This hole in the wall restaurant is always a safe and satisfying choice to myself, my friends, and many other college kids. Aladdin's is a great restaurant to eat tasty food for a cheap price.  Aladdin's food is not the normal run of the day meal. They have a wide variety of authentic Indian food. But their signature dish is the jumbo lamb and beef gyro. They serve this order with grilled tender beef and lamb, with slices of onions and tomatoes, and their delicious tzatziki sauce. All these ingredients are put in soft pita bread, which causes your taste buds to fire with euphoria. If one adds their crispy fries to their meal, it becomes the ambrosia of the avenue, and along with an affordable price of seven dollars. &#160;  Also, the service is exceptional for the kind of restaurant Aladdin's is. The people who work there give off a friendly and comfortable feeling. They can work at an efficient rate, handing your order to you in five to ten minutes. Upon leaving, they will always give one a kind gesture, such as telling you to have a good day. I often see a good amount of people tipping them on the way out. &#160;Aladdin's is not the most luxurious place to eat at, but it's not that kind of restaurant. Aladdin's give one the experience of having a delicious meal at a cheap price. Aladdin Falafel is a pretty decent place to pick up some cheap Mediterranean food. It's a pretty small space: there's the counter next to the door and an adjoining side room with a few tables and chairs. It's another one of those cool places where you can be sitting at the table observing them make your food while also catching a little people watching on the Ave. They are pretty quick and moved a long line of people through efficiently.I had a falafel (since it's the name of the place, I figured it had to be tried) which was rather good. Just the right amount of sauce and the bread was soft and chewy. The prices are also hard to beat; for two of us with drinks it was $11.
This is one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle. &#160;I love the wine flights - they have a great variety, and it's nice to be able to sample 4 at a time without having to pick and choose which ones. &#160;I've tried a red and a white (can't remember now which ones) but they were all great wines.I love the tasting bar too - my friend and I came here on a Sat afternoon and ordered a bunch and they were all fabulous. &#160;Some of them was unexpectedly delicious~ &#160;I esp liked the feta walnut spread, drunken figs with smoked prosciutto, and beef carpaccio. &#160;We also tasted a couple of cheese which were great as well. &#160;Our waitress was very knowledgeable and was able to recommend some great choices and wines for us too. &#160;Not only is the food great, so is the ambience. &#160;I've always sat near the big windows and enjoyed the views - inside (huge wine tower in the middle, very high open ceilings) and outside (well, I like looking at the city and watching the people walk by =))I've only had the lamb burger for dinner which was ok so I can't really talk about the dinner selections, but I definitely recommend coming here for the tasting bar, cheese, and wine!My goal is go back and try every wine they have :) This place is fantastic; hands down one of the best meals I've ever had with my boyfriend.Food: Decadent, as our server said. Our lobster mac and cheese was delicious, our salmon mousse melted on our tongues, and our truffles for dessert were wonderful also. I highly recommend the prix three four - it's a great way to get a lot for your money - and try an appetizer, salad, entree, and dessert.Service: Fantastic. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and very very fluent with word choice. He had me sold on the lobster mac and cheese in 2 seconds. He checked in often and made sure we were enjoying everything.Price: Again, I stress the prix three or four - which is only $30 or $40. This is an amazing price for the quality of food there.Ambiance: Not amazingly romantic since it's a bit loud and very busy, but the spiraling wine-case and the candles do set a nice atmosphere. Go here! You will love it. Whenever I come back home to Seattle, a visit to the Purple Wine Bar is essential.I live in the SF Bay Area, and I have yet to find a wine bar as good as this. I always order a couple entrees, the calamari is excellent as well as their bruschetta. I order one of their vinaigrette salads with steak and sample a bunch of their flights. They once had my favorite wine there, which is a rare find in general, so that definitely added to my excitement here. This is a great place to go with friends or even on a date. Dress up, share some appetizers and sample all the different themed flights they have to offer. The decor is modern and very open and spacious when you walk in. Right in the middle is their circular bar with a big, cylinder-shaped staircase full of wine. Very classy and modern. The atmosphere is good, like I said for a group of people or a date. It's a little loud as it's so big and open. Come here to experience many flavors and for an excuse to get cute! I can certainly understand why this place is so busy all the time. &#160;The food, the service the selections are all great. &#160;Sunday night they have half off bottle of wines under $50. &#160;Not a bad deal at all!First of all, they carry Navarro grape juice. &#160;If you've never had this, this is definitly not your typical grape juice and is a must. &#160;Has so many elements of a wine, but without the alcohol. &#160;If you ever get down to the Napa area, it is worth the trip outside of Napa towards the coast to Philo. &#160;Visit Navarro... some of the best wines out there. &#160;I had the Lamb Chops... mmmmm lamb. &#160;Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned and perfectly portioned. &#160;It was served with this not so rich demi-glace... but was flavor enough to compliment the potatoes and meat of the lamb.The date had the Chicken Saltimbocca, which was just tender, moist and tasty. &#160;David our server was great. &#160;He was friendly, didn't rush us, was attentive, but allowed us to enjoy our different plates... From their tasting menu, I tried the drunken figs and smoked prosciutto.... intersting combination, the sweet figs and the salty prosciutto... it would have been better with some sort of cheese.I tasted the baked oysters, creamed spinach, bacon and bread crumbs... not so good. &#160;It was cold... so not what I was expecting. &#160;It wasn't bad, but next time I would have them heat them up a bit more.Overall, worth visiting. I celebrated my 21st birthday here. Yup folks, I did not wear a airplane shot bottle necklace, have strangers write all over me and black out hugging the toliet bowl on this special day. That was my 18th birthday. HA just kiddingokayreallynot. Celebrating my 21st in style was attainable here at Purple. &#160;A bottle of Vueve welcomed us and the majority of my dinner party tried cab flights and got pizzas to share. The little dessert bites at the end were phenomenal. Everything was absoutely delicious. The server was knowledgable and friendly. I had a great birthday here and would love to return when Im in Seatown again. Wine bars are becoming a dime a dozen but this one's got one up on the others.... &#160;They have a mezanine area where you can go up one set of stairs and down another. &#160;This is key in case you ever wanted to play tag, you can run around literally forever. &#160;I mention this for the mere fact that I grew up deprived for our house had many cul-de-sacs, which, if you're playing tag, doesn't bode well. &#160;Somehow we made ado with some head fakes and swift back &amp; forth action. &#160; What I never understood was how my siblings never caught on? &#160;Don't pretend, you KNOW what I'm talkin bout Willis.Wine was good, 12-year scotch was better, and the $13 burger was best! Due to the restaurants high ceilings, the acoustics are pretty loud, but not too bad where you have to yell across the table to you company. Our server was spot on, even if he was wearing girl's skinny jeans.The food, OMFG the food; so damn good. We did tasters paired with wine before our entrees. Here's a rundown with a scale rating of 1-5 on the orgasm meter:Artichoke Parmesan spread w/white wine: mmmmm (3)Bucheron Goat Cheese with Cranberries w/red wine: ah ah mmm OH YEAH! (5)Gorgonzola Stuffed Dates: mmmmm (3)Grilled Chicken Sammy: YES! RIGHT THERE! (4)Roasted Chicken Saltimbocca: YES! RIGHT THERE! (4)Mint Choc Chip Cheesecake ice cream with gram crunch: OMFG I JUST CAME!!! (10+)Ok, is it bad that I want to take that dessert with me and make sweet sweet love to it? It is? SCREW YOU FOR JUDGING ME!!! Thank goodness it's only a small scoop, because I could seriously balloon my ass on this stuff. Aside from the amazing and obvious deluge of gorgeously tasty wine choices, the food is also amazing. I had the bruschetta for an appetizer and for the main lunch course I had the lamb burger with yukon gold french fries (absolutely unique and tasty). A coworker ordered the lobster mac n cheese which I've now heard from several including him that it is to die for as far as comfort food goes. (Next time I will try the Ahi tuna steak).I ordered a $10 glass of reisling, which, to my dismay, was filled up to about the two inch marker (come on, at that price?) of my glass. I can't complain though, it was worth every drop, and of course, I really shouldn't complain since I ordered a second glass of my own free will. The service was decent, but not super fast - allowed enough time for me to wonder when I could order that second glass.Our small group of 5 was celebrating a birthday and the server was kind enough to bring out a tasty array of shareable, small size deserts with a lovely candle in the middle. (The idea was fun, but they weren't so yummy really.) The good news is, I did get the luxury of being offered a box (although I requested foil instead of the bulky box) and they were gracious enough to actually wrap up the rest of my burger for me. Ordered:Toothstainer wine sampler Baked Brie appetizerApple Fontina Walnut saladBlood Orange SorbetEnjoyed 3rd and 4th glasses of wine in the Toothstainer. The first glass tasted like 2 Buck Chuck...sour and not complex.Baked brie contained delicious carmelized onions but the onions weren't evenly distributed....instead they were all clumped in one part of the cheese. The flat bread the brie was served with was tasty, both sweet and salty.The salad was a tad boring. The waitress warned me that the cheese was extremely pungent but it wasn't at all.Blood orange sorbet was sprinkled with Orange Sugar. Delish. This place is great when you're in the right mood. &#160;When you want to wear something a little nicer, and be in a loud, vibrant, energetic room. &#160;The dining room is absolutely beautiful, very modern with the tallest ceilings and windows imagineable. &#160;The food and wine are pricey, but tapas are always fun, as are wine tastings. &#160;For wine, choose from a large selection of bottles or various flights. &#160;For food, choose from small plates and/or entrees. &#160;I highly recommend a cheese plate (particularly good cheeses here) and the squash ravioli. &#160;Note that small plates and desserts are particularly tiny. &#160;The lobster mac &amp; cheese is always tempting, but I've seen many disappointed by it, so try to resist. &#160;Overall, a fun and vibrant dining experience.Tip: Bottles of wine under $50 are 50% off on Sundays, so mark off that Monday morning calendar and Enjoy! 1. &#160;2 pages of wine flights - &#160;including a sparkling wine flight!!! (not to mention the gazillion pages for their wine list)2. &#160;Mac and cheese - they let me do a half order so I can order the duck confit pizza! &#160;I wanted both, but not two entrees!3. &#160;Cheese selection - HUGE! We need help from our server and she had great recommendations4. Sea Salt Caramels - they're damn good (my first thought when I bit into the caramel- Alinea in Chicago....but by no means is this place Alinea.)5. Moscato d'asti! (my coworker introduced me to "effervescent" wines and I now heart effervescent). The Purple Cafe Seattle is about 100 times better than the Kirkland location. &#160;Awesome selection, really classy interior design, and the huge glass windows just open up the space and becon you inside.The appetizers and drinks are excellent, and the staff is really friendly and responsive. &#160;I'd recommend meeting friends for drinks, and otherwise keeping the meals to business or dating - it's not a great value.It's going corporate, you can get a good deal at Costco actually: 2x $50 gift certificates for $70. Very nice. I like the flight holders.Beautiful ,chic a fine place to visit.Interesting food as well.The only down side (which they can't help) is the male lounge lizards sitting at the bar cranning to check out anything female, customers,hostesses....jeez guys we think your old as our dads!!!!!Yuck!! Ambience: 5Food: 4Value: 3I was here with a very good friend and we had a great time. I hadn't seen her in years and we just connected. It was pretty magical. The food was tasty. I liked it a lot. The desert tastings at the end were awesome, perfect size for sharing. The ambience is unbelievable, the twisting wine staircase is very unique. The place is PACKED and loud. I don't recall much of the service because we were talking so much. &#160;She is super cool. Purple is amazing. I'd stop in everyday if I could. Perfect for appetizers and a few glasses of wine. &#160;If you go you MUST MUST get the butternut squash ravioli. &#160;I'm tempted to ask for the recipe every time I'm there. &#160;SO GOOD!!Unfortunately it can get a little loud, so if you're looking for a place for conversation-you might have to yell. &#160;But who needs to talk when the food and wine is so good? &#160;:) I love this place! &#160;The last 2 times I have been up to Seattle, I have stopped by Purple. &#160;The first time I visited Purple I was with my husband and we stopped by for a drink before heading off to dinner. &#160;We liked it SO much we returned after dinner and stayed till close. &#160;The bar staff is super knowledgeable and as the tower of wine blatantly shows, the selection is out of this world. Perfect place to go to if you love wine and cheese. I love how the place is so loud and lively during dinners. As for the food, the calamari was great and the burger my friend had was okay. The flights were nice! This is a really good place to come with friends =) One of my favorite restaurants so far in Seattle. The decor is amazing even in the bathroom. The food was excellent. The ceiling are 50 feet tall and the table are placed spaciously. I was seating in at a corner table with glass views of the street. Was an extremely pleasurable dining experience. If you're a wine connossier then this place is for you. They have a huge selection of wines to choose from. Let's not forget the array of dishes to choose from. The restaurant is in the middle of downtown and the ambiance is romantic so it would be perfect for a date or night on the town whether you're here just to drink wine or eat. If you're here for the meal, &#160;and have burnt over 3K calories for the day then I highly recommend the lobster mac and cheese!!! Ah Purple... when I think of the color Prince comes to mind... yeah I grew up in the 80's. This modern decor is pretty cool looking with the huge windows that dominate this corner location, the high ceilings, to the center bar with the beanstalk-like wine tower housing at least a few hundred or more bottles as it circles its way up to the ceiling. There is a mezzanine level that has another bar lounge area for cheese &amp; wine tasting (as well as entrees of the menu) and is first come first serve. Looked like a really cool place to kick it. You've got to get there early on the weekends to post your flag.The scene is fairly loud but surprisingly you can still engage in your own conversations without getting too distracted. And apparently you need to invest in the experience as our time spent there rolled into a 4 hour event as it took about an hour to get our entrees. It turned out that our ticket was 'lost'. Had to call the babysitter to let em know that we'd be an hour late. But the recognition of this fact by the staff would make things right. The place was absolutely packed and it showed as It took forever to get our first round of cocktails and bread. No matter because we were having some great conversation catching up with the friends we haven't seen in a long time. Finally got around to ordering after about 45 min since being seated. We did shoo away the very nice waitress one time because we were slightly in awe of the options... from the 13 different flights of wines (each with a sampling of 4 pours) , the various tasters to choose from at different price points ($3-$6) with each offering up a wine paring to boot, to the starters and eventually the entrees. We all ordered the Prix Fixe to keep it simple. You get a choice of 2 starters... out of 5 options... one entree... of 3 options... and a dessert choice out of four options... for $30 bones.The hour it took to finally get our entree kind of worked out because we all commented how full we felt after eating our salads and tasters. So as the four of us polished off the last gulps of our glasses of wine dinner finally arrived. But with a lovely twist. The manager came over before our plates were set down and apologized with class by opening another bottle of the same wine we just indulged in!! This all done without out any Bitchassness from our table.Had the Roasted Chicken Saltimbocca that came with seasonal veggies(Asparagus). The plate was delicious and had a lot of juice at the bottom of the bowl. It would have been really nice if it also came with mashed potatoes to soak up that juices.If it had not been for the comped bottle of wine and genuine sincerity that came along with the apology from the manager as well as our very friendly server I probably would not have thought twice about returning. Coupled with the fact that it really didn't bother us helped us blow it off even easier but it could have gone south in a very bad way IF it was handled differently but it wasn't so kudos to the folks at Purple.A return visit will happen!On the positive tip:- great looking place - great wine selection- great food- excellent staff- good times- humbleness &amp; service can go really far in winning over 1st timers to win a repeat visit- Single folks... if you want to impress someone for a first date... consider Purple. SEA SALT CARAMELS!!!!!! You seriously must get the sea salt caramels. &#160;They have changed my life. &#160;We got an order for dessert and went back the next day for 3 orders to go. &#160;Mmmmmm. It looks really cool and you really feel like a cool guy when you're sitting in there. &#160;;) &#160;They have an extensive wine list &#160;and food menu. &#160;I went for dinner with friends and the service left a lot to be desired. &#160;The waiter seemed distracted and it was at least 10 minutes after we were seated that he came to greet us and ask if we had any questions. &#160;The sommelier was pretty darn snooty and not very helpful &#160;The food was ok...there were four of us at the table and only one LOVED her food, the rest were ok. &#160;If I ever go back, I think I would just go for the wine and maybe some cheese and forego the dinner. one of my best friends took me here for a belated birthday dinner.i LOVED it.we had a flight of white wine which was awesome because we got to taste 4 different types of white wine...and it was actually a lot of winewe had the baked oysters, duck confit, and ordered a cheese (i dont remember which one it was... but it was amazing with the crackers they served and the bread) oh and they serve it with jam...which was amazing as well. mmmm.we then shared the lobster mac and cheese which was SO GOOD. we were impressed with the chunks of lobster that was in it. soooooo good...for dessert we shared the blood orange sorbet, which was really refreshing and unique in taste. i love the atmosphere here...very casual but pretty upscale. our waitress paid a lot of attention to us so service was excellent. the menu is huge...it took us awhile to figure out what we wanted to order...but everything we ordered turned out to be deeeeelicious...i would definitely definitely recommend this place. love it. We walked in from the street, not knowing what the place was all about - the walking-in part wasn't all that easy, 'cause those metal doors are hea-vy! Anyhoo, the place wasn't all that full around lunchtime on Sunday, so we had a very relaxed meal at one of the loft tables. Service was excellent, my chicken pizza exceeded my expectation, plus I had a great glass of wine to finish things off. Next time I'm in Seattle, I'm definitely coming back. My friend and I stopped in to Purple on a Friday afternoon after shopping. &#160;We only got one draught to share, but the bartender was really knowledgable about what we were drinking, and it was very exotic African wine that I would never have tasted otherwise. &#160;The restaurant itself was so beautiful. &#160;Hundreds of wine bottles lined the walls and reached up to the ceiling. &#160;I only wish I could have come back at night to try some of the appetizers and more of the delicious wine!
- Locale Destination - It's on University Way and between 42nd St &amp; 43rd St in Seattle. (University district)Hours: 11am to 130am (7days a week)!! Great that they are open late! Great location. Decor is just a simple and casual - typical Vietnamese pop &amp; mom shop. Service is decent to me. Nothing bad as many Yelpers complained. - Gluttony Expedition - Udon noodle curry: Poor quality udon noodles were in Thai yellow curry with pumpkin, carrots, and onions. It got a sweetness from pumpkin yet still spicy! It wasn't "yellow curry" as you normally expected. It was a lot soupier than usual since it was intended as a soup for the noodle. I didn't like the quality of noodle, but the soup wasn't bad. OK dish. - Conqueror's Deduction - It's a fusion Vietnamese noodle place. Decent food, decent price, and great "open late" noodle oasis for late night appetite. Not great but not bad. Noodle Nation is just okay. I have been there a handful of times now and while the food doesn't really wow me completely, the servers are pretty nice. They have a lot of options on their menu (I can't tell what type of cuisine is actually their specialty) so if you are the kind of person who likes to stick to one of two general items like myself you may feel overwhelmed. If you like your food spicy you may have to add on with other hot sauces which is a bit of a bummer, and they also do not serve beef. It's clean, but I haven't been inside the bathroom yet. Prices are a bit steep ranging between $8-$12 but the portions are generous. If you get a dry noodle dish you will most likely be able to stretch it out to two meals making it more wallet friendly. Mmm... the papaya salad was definitely the best I've had in the states. I lived in Taiwan for awhile and that was probably the closest thing to great papaya salad that I've experienced... having never been to Thailand. Anyway, we ordered the boat noodle soup (since it seemed like a MUST), phad kee mao and the papaya salad for dinner one night.My favorite was the salad and the boat noodle broth was amazing too. I also enjoyed the restaurant's atmosphere with all the cool Southeast Asian photography and decor. Service was quick and polite as well.The portions are pretty huge so we had to get a to-go box to pack up for the next day's lunch. I'd definitely come back to try other entrees on the menu and to eat more &#160;authentic papaya salad!!!Also, for those who don't know where the restaurant is, it's located where the old New China Restaurant used to be. The Ave has changed so much since I was still in school but I'm glad they are welcoming great new additions. Their phad see iew was not bad, but it could have used a lot more veggies and tofu (instead of just noodles). However, I loooooooooooooooooooved their udon noodle curry. It had some pumpkin, carrot, and onion with some fresh tofu. Oh, I love how chewy their udon noodles were!I also appreciate that they stay open until 1:30am! the only GREAT duck anything (noodle soup in this case) I've had in Seattle (besides bellevue's Wild Ginger but that's $$$). I'm from Taiwan so I know a good duck dish when I taste one. This is even better than I-District's Hue Ky Mi Gia's braised duck noodle soup for me. The duck meats comes in little strips w/ skin, not like HKMG which comes with a leg.However, it's on the pricey side when comparing to other U-District restaurant (but well worth it for me). Paid 12 buck for noodles.Restroom's clean, service's good, place's not crowded.Side note edit: just been informed the owner is not the same as UDistrict's Thai 65, but Renton's Thai 65 Since my first trip I have returned for Boat Noodle Soup, some spicy lime rice noodle thing, and more pad kee mao. Consistent, spicy, fresh and fast. Wow. Went here for lunch during a family trip to the Burke Museum. &#160;Server was friendly with prompt seating/greeting/order taking. &#160;Food was excellent - we got two orders of Pad Thai (two and four stars), the fresh rolls &amp; the fried tofu. &#160;I couldn't give Noodle Nation 5 stars for a few reasons though: &#160;We were asked if we wanted the appetizers/meals all at once and we said yes - but the appetizers (Which were intended for our children) came first and so of course were devoured before our meals had arrived (leaving us to entertain 2 young children while we tried to eat our own food). &#160;My husband's pad thai came and then mine....well.... we looked around for several minutes, I had figured it was coming right up after his.... and finally after making eye contact with our server he hollered something back to the kitchen about pad thai and came over to tell us it would be out in a few minutes. &#160;I think they totally forgot about it. &#160;And lastly, the bathroom - oooh it was icky. :-( &#160;Normally my husband complains about taking our girls into the men's bathrooms because they tend to be disturbingly dirty compared to my experiences in most women's bathrooms. Not so here - I'll just say I definitely didn't put my daughter's bum to the seat, and we were afraid to flush. &#160;'Nuf said. I think the other reviews have said it all. I'm supposed to go back tonight and find myself salivating at the prospect! I definitely got the sense that their noodle dishes included more total and a greater variety of ingredients than competitors. Easily worth the $3 premium IMHO. The first time I was there, it wasn't bad at all. &#160;The second time which was the last time, there was nothing to be happy about. &#160;I couldn't believe that they took a long time to serve when they weren't even busy? &#160;and... when they served our food, they told us that our appetizer was still being cooked in the kitchen and that they would bring it shortly. &#160;I said, never mind!! Four stars for now simply because I have only been there once and only had pad thai, but it was on par with the best pad thai I've ever had. Maybe I'll change it to five stars soon. I should try a few other things first though. All I can say for now is this is *most definitely* a good restaurant. The two things that set this place apart from other noodle shops in the U District is that they are open late and they have very rich, spicy noodle soups. &#160;The first time I came here, I got the wonton soup and was unimpressed. &#160;However, after reading other reviews on yelp, I went back and ordered the boat noodle soup, which was amazing. &#160;I would get it medium spicy with thin rice noodles. &#160;The crab and chicken wing appetizers are also quite good. &#160;The only complaint I have is that it's pretty overpriced compared to other noodle shops in the U District. &#160;However, if you're in the U District and you want noodle soup with the best flavor and you don't mind paying a few dollars more, then this is a great place to go. this is my current favorite noodle spot on the Ave. first it was thai tom, then thai 65, then thai ger, then thai tom again, and now Noodle Nation.its certainly not perfect everytime, but i'm loving the soups, curries, and phad see ew - and am usually pleasantly surprised when i try something new.service is better than average, and the ambiance is nice. Ever crave pho late at night after drinking? Too bad there's no pho places open that late.. BUT wait there's noodle nation! when everyone else doesn't know what to eat, Be the cool guy and say "guys... 2 words, noodle nation. noodle nation" get the duck soup or boat soup. good for large groups. Will try again but did not get good impression on its food that other people seemed to have....It is conveniently located, cheap and clean. The only trouble I had was the food - cannot say it was bad but mediocre at best....Next time I may try Phad Thai following Yelp recommendations... I totally misjudged this place. &#160;With a name like Noodle Nation, I wasn't expecting the best food. &#160;But holy shit, I've only had one noodle dish here but it was amazing. &#160;The bowl itself was pretty big, they give you a shit ton of extras (meat, tofu etc) and the service was really good..surprisingly. &#160;I cannot wait to try this place again Best thai food in the city and they're open late! I thought my favorite thai noodle dish was phad thai, but after discovering some of the other dishes on the menu and their unique flavors i now crave i have a really difficult time choosing.I've been to a bunch of thai restaurants in the city, and this is by far my favorite. Plus the staff is always so fun and friendly, its really easy for this place to become your new hangout.And i hear a bar is coming soon! I love the duck noodles (dry), however, it wasn't a good first impression. My first time eating the duck noodle; it was too sour. Maybe the chef was sleepy since I went there at 12 a.m. on Friday. Who wants to work on Friday midnight? :p Anyway, &#160;I ordered no 15. and I like it. It's the duck noodle soup. I don't like it as much as the dry one. I heard the Guey jap is delicious as well, but I never try it. :D I'll drop a review if i try.
Bad quality dim sum. I only tried three items that looked presentable on the push cart. &#160;Unfortunately, I was nauseated after a few nibbles. The har gow was mushy and instantly fell apart when I bit into it and the green onion buns tasted bland and stale. &#160;The eggplant and tofu dish was a bit oily and oversteamed. I stopped eating after that and went over to Jade Garden which offers consistently decent dim sum. Stuff here is ok, i really only order the garlic spare ribs here. &#160;Oh, and it gets packed on club nights, so I definitely would not tell you to chow down here. &#160;Service is ok at best. I don't know what it is. Maybe they lace the food with something. But everytime I go to Seattle, I MUST eat at this place. It's cheap eats for the most part. And it's typical Chinese cafe fare, but something draws me back. I can't even remember what I ate there the last time around, but I'll be back. Sort of like the Denny's of Asian food. What the hell? Why are all of you ordering off the menu? We went once and missed lunch so we ordered off the menu and it wasn't that great but weekend lunches are a treat. If you look at the reviews here you'll notice that either people are stumbling in stone drunk in the middle of the night or their ordering off the menu. Here's my suggestion, go on Saturday at about 11am and have lunch and don't even pick up the menu. When a cart goes by and you can't understand what the heck they're saying just have them show you everything and pick what you want by sight. I like any of the pork dimsum and some of the shrimp are good too. Overall it's the experience you're there for becuase it's a bit crazy at lunch but the food is fresh and good. Food's not bad. But not that great either. I loved their Thai-Style udon noodles but they took that off the menu some time ago so that's pretty lame. You usually have to wait a long time to get seated. Wait staff sucks. You have to ask them 5 times for water before they bring you any. For late night food Purple Dot might hit the spot. &#160;For lunch however, it's a different story. &#160;If you want something other than dim sum be prepared to wait. &#160;We were seated immediately but it took a while to get menus and then even longer for someone to take our order. &#160;Then there was the wait for food. &#160;Then for the bill. &#160;It shouldn't take an hour and half for lunch. &#160;The food itself itself was okay. &#160;Nothing to write home about for sure. &#160;I had one of the soups and it was very bland. &#160;No one seemed that impressed by the food or the service. &#160;There are many other better lunch places in the ID. Ive been here 4 or 5 times and it's not all that. &#160;It's newer and trendy for the young crowd, and they're open late... that's about all the good I can say about this place. &#160;General rule of thumb with dimsum is, the busier it is, the fresher and &#160;hotter the food. &#160;I went here with wifey for a little dimsum and it was terrible. &#160;Place was almost empty, but it was around 1, so I figured we beat the crowd by showing late. &#160;Wrong. &#160;We requested dimsum and they went around the corner and brought out this sorry ass half empty cart with semi lukewarm food. &#160;After seeing very little on the cart we wanted, we chose the standard shumai and ha gow and waited patiently for more items to appear. &#160;They never did. &#160;In fact, after eating 6 sorry ass pieces of dimsum, they asked if we wanted anything else as if we were done. &#160;Dumbfounded, I looked at Shari, and back to our hapless server and said, "Yes!" &#160;She looked confused. &#160;I said we were there for dimsum, and she (after microwaving a few things) came back with her sorry ass cart from which I went with a safe bet of spare ribs. &#160;They were fucking cold. &#160;I flagged down our waitress and informed her of this problem and ahe sent it away, presumably to be microwaved again. &#160;The food and service here is less than okay, as this is not much different from my other experiences here. &#160;Dont go here for any reason unless you just want to know what cold food and bad service are like firsthand. This review is for the dim sum only. I came here with my family and a couple friends (5 of us) at around 12:30pm so it was pretty busy. We were seated right away so we didn't have to wait for a table. It did take us awhile to wait for some of the dim sum ladies to push their carts to our table to get some food. Since we were eating at a busy hour, all of our dim sum was hot and fresh from the kitchen. The fact that my grandma was there and was able to order the food in Chinese was a plus too. The taro dumplings were excellent and the chicken feet (fung zhao) was pretty good. We also had the BBQ pork buns, shu mai, egg tarts and the sticky rice w/meat wrapped in lotus leaves. The ha gow (shrimp dumplings) was a little bit on the soggy side but everything else was decent. I ate so much that it felt like my arteries were crying, but thank goodness for the tea to wash all that fatty goodness down. Compared to most other dim sum places in Chinatown, this one is the least expensive. I recommend coming here during busy hours so that your food will be nice and hot. Bahn was set on showing me the JJs of Seattle. &#160;I realized why Bahn called Purple Dot the "JJ's of Seattle", instead of calling JJs the "Purple Dot of LA". &#160;To paraphrase Lloyd Bentson:"Purple Dot, I was served with JJs. I knew JJs. JJs was like a friend of mine. And Purple Dot, you are no JJs."This place just doesn't feel right. &#160;The fob waiters don't even act all that fobby. &#160;There's no hk-tinged English - it's straight up perfect English. &#160;And where are the girls and the gangs? &#160;Also, at JJ's on a Saturday night, it's like the massage parlor in rush hour - girls of all types stream in and subconsciously dare you to pick them. &#160;At Purple dots, it's like a Marco Polo expedition - people of all types - and they're consciously begging for you to feed them.Business tip for the wise - Seattle's starving for some better late night options.
Came here for lunch today. When I first walked in I saw the big menu on the wall opposite the entrance. The prices didn't really seem that good. A bento was $13-14 and the lunch plates were around $8. Luckily I turned around and saw the white board with the daily specials. $5.50 for chicken katsu with rice and salad. $7.50 for a bento with chicken teriyaki and a California roll. We got those since it was a pretty big difference in price from the regular menu. The bento was a little lacking. Pretty small. The chicken katsu came with a LOT of chicken but lots of breading and pretty greasy. It was edible but not great. Same with the bento. Too many places in that area to get a weekday lunch deal to come back to King's Teriyaki, so I probably won't be back.
Foods good. &#160;Staffs pretty homogenous. &#160;But they make the WHOLE Pike corridor smell like spaghetti and vomit when they open their windows while their brewing beer. &#160;It's offensive and I wish they had a little more consideration for their neighbors. Good atmosphere, but typical overpriced pub food. &#160;I had the bacon cheeseburger, which was fine, but nothing to rave about. &#160;However, I'm giving it an extra star for the fries and chicken wings, which were pretty damn good! Good quality food near Seattle University campus.Price is not cheap but its near the private university...so what do you really expect.Once again, for parties larger than 5 or 6 people, they only take one check per table. Good selection of Belgian beers, decent food, no long waits.Very loud though. eep Love this place. We go here A LOT.The beer is so so good. (very partial to the Immortal IPA)Food is great too. If you're vegetarian, go for the Oasis Platter or the Veggie BBQ sandwich. (we get these every time we go..)Probably my favorite place on the hill, not pretentious at all.:) Pike/Pine corridor + 10pm Friday night + large-ish group of people = almost certain failure when it comes to finding a place to go out. Luckily, you can find a place to sit and get some decent beers at the Elysian. It's more Ram than Stumbling Monk in almost every regard, though the beer selection is far less fratty and more decently priced for what it is. So unless your group is dead set on that cozy Euro-basement vibe, the Elysian just might be your saving grace on a busy bargoing night. Well Done Nachos... blah. Why would a cook serve this to a patron at the bar paired with a Dementor's kiss? It almost sucked my happy and sunny Seattle day out of me. Thank goodness, I am not "passive aggressive". The awesome bartender with a cool sleeve tat on his arm understood my pain and showed chivalry towards me for this HH app. Thank you, Sir.I will be back. Great drinks. Great service. Quite the mishap or understanding upon my first time here last week. &#160;Happy to state that: "I had a blast". &#160; =0) Their Black Bean Burger ($10) is still to die for! &#160;Paired with the Dragonstooth Stout ($5), it makes one excellent meal for under $20 bucks. Every single time I tell myself to branch out, I always end up ordering the same meal because I can't let that delicious vegetarian burger go! Fair to middling food, standard pub fare with a few specials. If you are into beer, then this place does have a good selection. If you want a properly made drink, then you better hope the name describes the ingredients (vodka tonic, etc..) They make a Manhattan properly about one time in four. Some pumpkin ale around Thanksgiving/Halloween is amazing. Otherwise the food/service is fine. Beer + Burger + Fries = Good timesA college girlfriend of mine came to visit Seattle. I took her for a mini Capitol Hill Tour. Elysian is one of the stops because we both enjoy having cold light beers. We arrived there and were seated after 15 mins. I had the Elysian burger. It's not the best I've had, however, it was cooked medium rare like how I wanted. The pickle on the side was good. I wish I would have known they had sweet potato fries. I ordered AMBROSIA MAIBOCK (the server did a great job recommended me this one) and zephyrus pilsner and I liked Ambrosia Maibock better than the other because it's a bit sweeter. As far as the service goes, it's ok! The server forgot us. I gave her an excuse, "it's too busy" The table we were at was kind of in the middle of traffic. And, it was quite inconvenient! Of course, we still managed to have a great time here! I don't drink beer at all, so this is not a review with personal experiences with their beer.I've been here twice and I really want to like it.I like the size, the ambiance (nicer than a typical pub) and the fries were delicious. &#160;I love that cucumber-dill sauce thing. The food all sounds so good and the guys all like the beer a lot hence how I end up here. However, the service last time was atrocious! Yes, I know its crowded but there was a 20-30 minute wait between being seated (by the hostess!) and a waitress coming to take our orders. &#160;I am pretty sure there were only 2-3 waitresses for the huge place on a Friday &#160;night! Schedule/hire more people!! We were there for about 3 hours. &#160;The waitress came twice to take our orders. &#160;The guys decided they wanted to leave because they couldn't get drunk at the rate she was serving us. We spent over half an hour looking for her to get the bill. &#160;We finally had to ask a bus boy. &#160;He told us we had to find our waitress and asked us what she looked like. &#160;All of us stared at him blankly. &#160;It had been over an hour-- we didn't know! Needless to say, we tipped 10% and got out of there as fast as we could.The 3 stars was for everything else. This is a decent place to go occasionally, but there is just too much that isn't right to make me want to go back regularly. The beer: It's ok. There is nothing wrong with Elysian, but it's not something I would miss if I left the area. There are a lot of better local brews in this area (and region, if we want to expand out to Oregon). It's perfectly fine, but I have never been really wowed by anything there.The food: Average, at best. The best thing on the menu is the Oasis Platter. I've never had anything on the menu that makes me want to come back, and the last time I went, I had a special that was really, truly average.The service: Usually missing something. It's hipster haven, which is fine and to be expected for what it is and where it's located. Still, it's not an excuse to be so aloof and slightly rude. It's consistent with every server I remember having there. Once we stayed a little too long, and it was like pulling teeth to get anything accomplished. Overall, there are a lot better places to go, but it's convenient for so many people I know that I find myself going back. The service in this place needs to improve. Pronto.First time. We sat down and we were not even acknowledged for about 15 minutes. Then when water came, the server was rude and abrupt. We left.Second time. There really shouldn't have been a second, but well, everyone has a bad day now and then, so thought we'd give it another try. Plus there was a good basketball on that we wanted to watch.This time, I brought a grilled cheese (1/2) sandwich for my 11 year old who has dietary issues. We were very discrete and respectable about bringing in outside food.The server: "We don't allow outside food."Me: "She has dietary limitations so we had to bring something."The server: "Oh yeah. Well, we serve grilled cheese."Rude.Did the server even consider that the bread was gluten free?Anyway, the service here consistently sucks. The food is 3 stars. Please get better. Yes, it's an upscale brewpub, and yes, Seattle has more than its share of upscale brewpubs at this point. &#160;But here's why the Elysian should get its due:* Their homemade list of beers is usually long and there is always a handful of gems on it. &#160;In particular, the annual Nightowl has the distinction of being my favorite locally brewed beer* Great food for a brewpub. &#160;Their nachos are almost always good, and their steak tacos are consistently marvelous. &#160;Not to mention all the standard burger-y type stuff you can't go wrong with. &#160;* It was ahead of its time. &#160;When I first visited it in 2000, it was the only good brewpub I know of in Seattle. &#160;I also am slightly partial to the attitude the servers tend to deal. &#160;Even if the joint feels a little banal by the standards of Lindas, the sassy waitstaff makes up for it and gives Elysian character. &#160;5 star. Peanut sambal=genius, and even though the idea of a spicy peanut sauce as an accompaniment to nachos seemed odd on paper, I was pleasantly surprised. &#160;The beer selection was smaller than I expected, but I s'pose I've been spoiled by places like TapHouse. &#160;I guess the service was okay, although I admit I wasn't really paying all that much attention to such things because of the great conversation I had there, but that's another story altogether... I don't really like this place.The good: -A lot of room - the booths are fairly large. &#160;A handful of booths are by the window and it allows for people watching/anthropological/sociological observations.-The Fries - sooo good!-Steamed Clams are alrightThe Bad:-The nachos - kind of weird for bar nachos (peanut arbol chili sauce) --Some servers are rude but not in the 'wow she's so hot kind of way' but in the 'are you serious? kind of way'The Average:-Chicken Caesar salad The real story in this place is the beer. Cool beer names with unique, creative taste for each: Zephyrus Pilsner, my first, with a light &#160;taste all its own, the medium heavy Immortal IPA, the Elisian Fields, and a few others. When I can, I'd like to sit by the window and enjoy my sips while watching people pass by outside - my real situation in this place. Sometimes I trade smiles with the friendly staff walking occasionally to check on their customers, or I just sit there all spaced out, admiring the cool, open place and absorbing the view in general. Elisian is one sweet place to be if you want some good, tasty, and uniquely-named brews while killing some good time with friends. Check it out sometime.
Yes...come here for the wide selection of beers, but the food is 'eh' at best. I ordered the Mahi Mahi Tacos for lunch and it was not tasty at all and cold. Disappointing. At least the Coke was good and cold! This is my neighborhood bar!I am always pleased with the jasmine avatar ipa &amp; sweet potato fries. &#160;The place is big so it never seems too loud or crowded, which is nice for a happy hour. &#160;The crowd is not the usual young capitol hill hipster type, a very comfortable, casual scene.You can count on a tasty brew here! :) Pubfood doesn't have to be greasy and boring. &#160;This is where I go to drown myself in well-made IPAs (Jasmine laced and non-Jasmine laced) and have a decent burger with sweet potato fries on a rainy day. &#160;My only complaint would be that when ordering a burger order 1 step below what you want. &#160;For example if you want a burger done medium, order medium rare since they tend to over cook it one notch. The hubby and I used to frequent this place often, it was our favorite date night treat. &#160;Unfortunately over the last few months they've begun to change their menu up, and not for the better (I verified the change with our waitress, just to make sure it wasn't just me). &#160;Therefore our favorite dishes, the ones that kept bringing us back, have been altered, leaving us muy disappointed. &#160;I hate when a restaurant starts using cheaper ingredients to cut costs and the prices stay the same or get higher--this does not bode well. &#160;I understand the cost of food goes up, but I'm more eager to pay an extra buck or two then sacrifice quality. &#160;Also, I have yet to have decent service in the last 8 months.I will still go back for drinks, but will most likely never eat here again--Sorry Elysian, but your little changes have added up too much for us, you've officially lost a few loyal customers. My friends and I went here before a show at Chop Suey to grab some dinner. &#160;I'd been to the Wallingford location and was pretty impressed, so I was excited to try this spot out. &#160;It was pretty good, but I came away a little disappointed overall.We were able to get a table for six pretty quickly at 7pm on a Thursday night, which I was impressed with. &#160;Both the hostess and the waitress were friendly and nice and we were seated in a good spot.I love the interior of the place. &#160;It's warm and inviting and the lighting is great. &#160;It's a good place to chat and hang out with your friends and share some beer or cider.For dinner, I went with the Portabella French Dip on the fresh sheet and was rather a let down. &#160;I knew it would be mushrooms and cheese on a french roll, but we are talking MINIMAL mushrooms. &#160;It was the thinnest mushroom I've ever had on a sandwich. &#160;It tasted good, but you could hardly tell it was there. &#160;There was also little evidence of cheese. &#160;The au jus was good as well, but the overall sandwich was just like dipping plain bread into au jus and eating it. &#160;It was sad. &#160;The fries, however, are super good here. &#160;Nice and crunchy with a soft interior. &#160;Love the overall flavor once I added a little bit of salt. &#160;They tasted great dipped in the aioli my boyfriend got with his meal.My boyfriend was super disappointed because they do not have fish and chips at this location. &#160;Previous reviews state they used to have them, so they must have been removed from the menu at some point. &#160;It was a pretty big letdown for him because he'd liked the ones he'd had at the Wallingford location and wanted to have them again.The nice thing about this place is that the waitress automatically split our bill four ways, with a total for each person. &#160;Only problem with that is we were actually splitting it two ways. &#160;She said it was no problem and went to split it...except she put the wrong totals on the wrong cards. &#160;So my boyfriend paid $10 more bucks than he should have and our friend paid $10 bucks less. &#160;He'll pay him back at some point, of course, but I just thought that was pretty unfortunate. &#160;Overall, I was a bit saddened by our trip here, but I would definitely go and try it again. &#160;It has the potential to be much better! I've been here twice on a lazy Sunday and the beer is good, the food is tasty but the service has been lacking. &#160;It took a while to have anyone come take beer / food orders and then closing out the check took forever.So, for the beer - most of the Elysian beers I've tried (mostly hoppy beers and bitters) have been delightful. &#160;Every once in a while, there has been one or two that haven't quite done it for me - but that doesn't mean that they aren't good beers.I've been really satisfied with the food and have tried sandwiches, nachos, specials...nothing has disappointed. I am a fan of microbreweries! &#160;While I only had the seasonal beer sampler and the black bean cake appetizer here, I reasonably enjoyed the experience. &#160;The black bean cake was awesome tasty (4 stars for the food) and the portion was generous. I enjoyed the beer sampler but none of the brew left an impression in my mind (unlike the Big N' Easy Ale from Wynkoop in Denver or the Blonde Ale from Glacier Brewhouse in Anchorage). &#160;I would definitely go again to try some of the other items on their menu to see if I change my mind; 3 stars for now. Elysian is one of those places that will follow you in life outside of the restaurant too; not only can you eat in and enjoy yourself, but also take out boxes of their signature seasonal beers for enjoyment later (four cases of Pumpkin Ale, anyone?). The location is very convenient, right in the main Cap Hill drag (at least for me). The restaurant is fairly dark, and from a first glance, seems more run-down than it is. The wood planking and decor can make it seem grungy, but it's a pretty nice setup inside. I highly recommend getting the beer sampler, even if you've been there before. With the choice of so many kinds, you might need to revisit each tumbler multiple times to 'decide' on a favorite. Of course, you could get pint-sized samplers too... Elysian's chocolate porter is definitely a favorite, although some more uncommon brews, like their jasmine beer, are also surprisingly good. The latter even got a non beer drinker to admit she kind of liked it :)The food is of fair quality, perhaps a tad above your pub average. Nothing wrong with it, just nothing too special. I'll have to say, however, that the portions were very generous. I'm a big eater, but between my friend and I, a nachos appetizer and two entrees ended with a third of the nachos and half an entree being boxed. The sampler also gives you a chance here to find a beer that goes well with a meal. Forget fancy schmancy wine pairings, I'm talking about about the complementing of a good 'ole glass of porter with a burger. What vacation doesn't include some sort of alcohol consumption? And since my BF and I are beer drinkers, we make it a point to go to Beer Bars. I was happy to have been recommended this place by a friend's sister who gave me some ideas on where to go when visiting Seattle.I was glad to see there was a variety, although small amount, of beer on tap. The BF had Dragonstooth Stout which was really great! I tried the Perseus Porter and thought it to be a decent standard. We decided to also try out the specialty sampler to explore what else they had. It included the Maibock, Bifrost winter ale, XOXO chili stout, Ragnarok smoked lager, and Bete noel. 3 out of 5 were good, the other 2 neither of us could drink, and i don't mind experimenting with flavors in beer. The place had a good vibe to it, the bartender was really nice and super helpful. Glad it was deemed a stop on our adventure. Sooooooooo good! I love this place. It is no secret that this brewery has the best beer in town but I feel the need to reiterate. It is Delicious! I love getting the sampler because I have such a hard time deciding which beer to order. &#160;I always leave happy. The food is pretty good and the service is excellent. I am never let down by any one of the wonderful staff.  On my last visit my girlfriends and I had a one of the best dining experience due to our witty bearded server. He charmed the pants off of all of us! He went out of his way to make us all laugh and made the whole night one to remember. I went here during lunch the week prior to Mariners starting home game and it was quite empty which wasn't a bad thing. There where about 14 or us from work and they served us quickly and got our food there promptly. The beer selection appeared to be mostly local with your common "import" (Guinness) and Lagers (Bud). The biggest disappointment was the food, many of us tried the different burgers they had and almost all of us where not very impressed. I had a southwest burger which supposedly was suppose to have pepper-jack cheese and other spicy additions but the burger was plain and I could barely taste any of it. The bonus was that the fries where quite tasty and there was a large amount of them. I'd suggest going here with a friend for a casual lunch or dinner but just expect food to be par.
Apparently this place is called "The 4 B's". I was not hip enough to know that until last night. My friend and I ended up here after a debate over what to do with our night. It was within walking distance of his house therefore it won out above all else. Ballard Grill &amp; Ale House is a bar for blue collar folks. It has a slight wannabe sports bar feel but mainly its a place to get cheap beer after a day spent working at the Locks. There are plenty of pool tables, darts, a modern jukebox, Golden Tee, Addams Family pinball machine (my personal favorite), and a safari shoot out game. On a Sunday night it was empty, just the way I like my bars. No wait for any of the games or for a drink. Food is served here but I have yet to try it. I have no doubt the menu is filled with greasy deep fried foods. The way it should be at a bar like this. Ballard Grill &amp; Ale House is a simple bar for simple folks. No need to impress anybody here. Come as you are, have a cheap drink, and play a cheap game of pool. P.S. There is free pool Monday and Thursdays. I'm very repentant that I didn't check this place out sooner. &#160;Yes, a dive. &#160;But a damn good one, which is my favorite kind of place. &#160;My drinks were strong and reasonably priced. &#160;The fries were great. &#160;Service was friendly, to the point that my bar tender was sharing bits of European chocolate bars with me that another patron had given him for Christmas. &#160;Ha! &#160;Now that's good people.I left drunk, happy, and definitely planning to go again. I used to go here with my friend Joel after a hard day touring the thrift shops of the Aurora Ave corridor, play 70's glam rock on the juke, and get my ass kicked at pool. &#160;We had something different from the menu every time and it always hit the spot. &#160;That was over a year ago, when they had the divey laminated cafeteria menus in fine print, about 30 different burger combinations, and some great fish-n-chips.Last week I got a culture shock. &#160;Tri-fold Denny's style menus. &#160;No peanut butter &amp; pickle burger. &#160;Electronic jukebox? &#160;I has a sad.On the upside: &#160;the bacon &amp; blue cheese burger was still great, the onion rings still gave me heart burn (as all good rings should), and the same 2 dudes with dirty hair and trucker hats with real grease on them were still at the bar. &#160;Glad to see not everything has been so-called "improved".I hope they're not trying to draw the uppity-er patronage over to our beloved dark side. &#160;Because seriously, if I wanted to hang out with people who enjoy paying $6 for a pint and eating hummus instead of nachos, then I'd just walk across the street to Hale's. &#160;Or shoot myself. &#160;Tough call there. Happy Hour. $3.95 for a cheeseburger and fries that make McDonald's cry in the corner. Domestic pitchers $7...that's 2 beers anywhere else.
They deliver to First Hill. &#160;Automatically that means they rock in my world. &#160;Do you realize how hard it is to find restaurants that aren't pizza that deliver to First Hill? &#160;I called a place on Broadway and I live on Boren and was told that's out of their delivery range. &#160;So back to my Laadla review. &#160;I ordered pappadums and chicken tikka masala. &#160;It wasn't so mind numbingly excellent that I can't imagine ever going anywhere else ever again, but it was solid. &#160;I also had pakoras which I usually don't get. &#160;I liked those a lot actually. &#160;I ordered two orders of rice which was way more than I thought it was going to be. &#160;On my first order from a place I always get the middle most star possible because I'm not sure how spicy that will be but with this place I could probably go a star higher. &#160;All in all it was pretty good and since they deliver to First Hill I'll probably order from them again in the future. I love going to Laadla. &#160;The food is consistently good, if not innovative. &#160;The staff are completely earnest and polite. &#160;The decor is ropey and basic in a disarming way. &#160;The pleated fabric on all of the pendant lamps is very "mommy drinks" meets immigrant restauranteur chic. &#160;You just want these folks to succeed because you can feel that they're giving it their best shot. &#160;The young guy who generally works up front is strangely fascinating. &#160;He's the host, the waiter and the bus boy. &#160;Every time I go in there he's front and center. &#160;Same dark slacks with white running shoes. Same buttoned-up white shirt with the herringbone gold chain worn on the outside. &#160;I just want to tag him like a shark and follow him. &#160;His work ethic is the reason jobs are going to India: because they bust their asses over there and don't complain. &#160;Short of that, I'm just glad he's here to bring me fluffy keema naan and spicy chicken tikka masala. The pakora is good too. &#160;Go for the buffet. Or even the take-out. &#160;You cannot go wrong. &#160;Go over to Laadla on Fairview and have a meal and then go down to Lake Union and take a seaplane flight. &#160;Trust me...you'll count it as a good day. Ignore the fact that it's almost always empty and awkwardly silent because the food is awesomely consistent. &#160;The buffet has a ton of choices, even for the non-meat eaters. &#160;They also include yummy naan and pakora or samosas in the buffet. &#160;I haven't tried the bar yet, that will be my next step--though I have partaken in the $1 PBRs on Sundays!
Indian food with no tummyache afterwards! It's a miracle!So I organized a work lunch here and the gang trecked over a little after noony. Plenty of room for our merry band of seven (that's 3/4 of our office). Nice big buffet with the usual selections - chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, curry chicken, the spinach dish, the vegetable dish, good naan, many salads...alas, no desserts.Someone came over to ask if we wanted anything besides water, and the cashier never rolled his eyes when all but one of us (guess who?) paid one at a time with credit cards. Per person came in at $8 something - similar to my last Indian buffet (two this week - whew!), but lots more choices at this one. And it is within walking distance from work! Poori! &#160;That's all you need to know. &#160;Seattle has a limited number of Indian restaurants that actually make this incredible bread and this place is one of the few that does. &#160;And does it well.I was glad to learn there was another Indian place closer to where we live downtown. &#160;So we gave it a try. &#160;The food was excellent. &#160;The sauces were thick, creamy and didn't all taste the same, as so many restaurants tend to do. &#160;I highly recommend the mango lemonade too. &#160;I'm looking forward to future take-out.And it was super easy to bring the kid too. I have been on a half-hearted mission to replace my favorite Houston Indian place in Seattle. &#160;I say half-hearted because after my first few months here without finding anything promising I sort of gave up thinking 'oh well, at least that's about a million less calories my body will consume per week'. &#160;Disappointing, I know, because some Indian food is worth being fat for. &#160;I was excited when I passed Laadla. &#160;It had all the makings of an excellent find: sketchy hole in the wall atmosphere, decent Yelp reviews, and not far out of the way of my usual Sunday routine. &#160;I decided to brush off my cynicism and give take out a try. The chicken tikka masala was about a subtly spiced as a brick wall. &#160;The sauce was so thick I could literally feel it sticking to my ribs. &#160;The chicken was tough and gamey with none of the smoky tandoori flavor that normally makes the dish. &#160;The naan was decent - flaky and buttery. &#160;The tamarind served with the papadam probably came from a jar.For me the true test of an Indian restaurant will always be the curry - it should be rich, decadent, impeccably spiced, and above all made with fresh ingredients. &#160;Laadla simply did not deliver. I walked in at 6:30 and became the 10th human being in the place! "Oh, noes!" I though, "not a good sign." However . . . Lamb Jalzari: Lamb curry with mixed vegetables: lots of peas, a little bit of cauliflower, a good amount of alright lamb, and a good amount of spice.Fried Paneer Appetizer: Tasty! A little bland, but hey, dude, it's FRIED CHEESE. Nan, Plain: Light, fluffy, chewy, crusty. Best Nan I've Ever Had.Basmati Rice: Perfectly acceptable.Mango Lassi: Not so much mango, but it wasn't too sweet either. I'd probably go Salty Lassi next time.All in all, $30 (including a nice tip from yours truly) is a bit expensive, but I have enough leftovers for lunch and then some. The owners are nice and pretty much left me alone, but seemed to get in a fight over the paper napkin situation. I'd return. It's better than the Irish Bar across the street. I don't walk into too many restaurants and immediately think, "It's humid in here!" But it WAS! Humid in there! Laadla offers an $8.95 lunch buffet, and since Cafe Venus was packed, we weren't in the mood for "german pub food" and SOLU has so few dining options, we threw caution to the wind and gave Laadla a shot. The buffet is more extensive than other places I've been to around town (I'm thinking Pabla and Habesha)- many more items to choose from and a lot of veggie choices. I only saw one chicken and one goat dish. Everything was kind of soupy, requiring copious amounts of rice and naan to help sop it all up. The samosa was pretty good- nice and crispy and packed with potatoes. Ate some pineapple for dessert. The thing I liked the most about Laadla was that there was absolutely no pressure to leave. We sat there chit-chatting the lunch hour away and there weren't any servers who were trying to hurry us out by prematurely bringing our check or anything. There were also a lot of solo-diners, which is cool. If I can ever muster up the courage to lunch alone, I might do it here. Found this place by accident one day with a friend. &#160;We weren't sure what to expect, and when we walked in, the place (which is quite large) was pretty much empty. &#160;BUT when our food came, we were pleasantly surprised! &#160;The best indian food I've had since coming to Seattle. &#160;The Naan was great. &#160;The host is also very nice.Now this is a regular place I call in pick-up orders to, after work. Pretty convenient for that, since it's right off the I5. I needed Indian food delivered to the Fred Hutch and they were the only nearby restaurant with delivery. &#160;Turns out they were wonderful. &#160;Sandeep called the day of to confirm the order and dropped it off on time. &#160;Everyone enjoyed the food, including our resident Indian-food-snobs in the group.
Man oh man. The service here is so sketchy. They have yet to get my order right. Where'd your waiter go? Who knows? It's Pho' not a four star bistro. I get it. I know what to expect service wise. But this has to be some of the worst service ever. Lucky for them they have a kick ass happy hour. Two dollar beers? Yep. Super Cheap Appetizers? Check. Good Pho? Affirmative. Two people dining for under 20 bucks with drinks? Been there, done that and lived to tell about it. You win this time Pho Cylco, you win this time. I went into this place, and waited to be seated. This guy working, pointed for me to sit at a table, as I was walking to the table, I realized that it was occupied, turned around and he was gone so I sat myself at another table near by.The lady that served me set tea and water out for me, but never once asked if I wanted something else to drink. I ordered pho with flank only (I don't like fatty meat at all)The bowl that I got came out filled and I mean filled with fatty meat, usually I don't say anything, but I could not eat it, so I asked him what some of the things were, he said fatty flank, and tendon. I told him that I wanted flank only. He asked me what number I ordered, and I told him I didn't order a number, I just ordered flank only. He was acting upset, but he remade it, and came back, saying "it was an honest mistake with an attitude". 1. I was not upset in any way, so why did he have to be so rude. 2. I didn't even ask him to make it again, he just took it, and replaced it, that was nice, but I didn't even ask him to, so again why such a bad attitude?My soup is back out, but he had walked off with the chop sticks, and so I asked a waitress for another set, and she nodded, and got someone else, another waitress came over, and I finally got something to eat my pho with. The broth is so salty, the flavors did not really blend together, and the meat was really tough. It was not aweful, but it was not really good either. &#160;Nobody came to check on me, or to see how I was doing. No one refilled my water or tea, and when the check came, she didn't say thank you, or nothing, she just left the bill on the table and walked off; um no tip, and they were not happy about that, sorry but poor service = NO TIP, and NO RETURN service from me... Definitely one of my top 5 Pho places in the Seattle Area.Their Steak pho is my favorite, pretty good quality meat and excellent broth. The Chicken pho is great too, I like that they give you a good amount of veggies with the chicken pho. These are why the pho is so good at this place:1. Good broth2. Onions served individually - so you can have the option to not stink up your  &#160; &#160;breath if you want to3. Dipping sauce - they work wonders with the meat! Sweet, gingery, spicy goodness4. No bull meat - they give you tons of meat and good qualityI also love their rice dishes. Especially the one with all the barbecue meat. I only hope they make better coffee and drinks. Let me state right off the bat that the stars apply ONLY TO THE FOOD. It. is. delicious and inexpensive. I've had pho around town and this is my go-to joint when I want to slurp down some damn good soup. &#160;Yesterday was a warm day so I tried the lettuce wraps and was very pleased at the flavor, the portion size and was stoked when I got the bill and they were only $4 due to HH. (NICE) I was full and took home half to eat for lunch today (again, all for $4!!??)I live 2 blocks away and have eaten here 10-15 times both alone and with guests. &#160;Each time the service sucked, honestly. &#160;It has been my experience that after the food arrives, the wait staff is not attentive. I always have to ask for refills on my lemonade, seriously: Every Time. If I need anything after I've started eating I have to flag down a server which is irritating. Ordering soup to go is even more irritating. &#160;Forget about a friendly greeting, a smile or conversation. &#160;(Heck, I'd be happy for eye contact! ) I order the same thing every time (#7) and get the same female cashier who is always in a hurry and seems annoyed. &#160;How about some loyal customer appreciation? Nope. She just wants that money so she can move on to the next customer. That said, I keep coming back for more. I'm hooked on that bomb broth, fresh basil, sprouts and chicken. MMMMMMMM YUM. &#160;I feel like Elaine in the Seinfeld episode with the Soup Nazi. Treat me like crap. I don't care. JUST GIVE ME THAT SOUP! I'm not a huge Vietnamese food guy, but something about being in Seattle made me want to try new things.We popped in after seeing what people were eating while walking by, and we're very pleased.Everything tasted so fresh, light and healthy. I'm a regular at Pho Cyclo. &#160;For the price and location, they seem to hit all the right notes. &#160;I like the location right across from QFC. &#160;You can park in the QFC garage and buy "something" to get your parking validated. I like that they have a large seating area with windows along the street front. &#160;The people watching is always interesting in Capitol Hill! &#160;The murals on the wall are interesting.....they depict scenes of Saigon and are worth inspecting if you have a moment. &#160;The food is above average and I give it 4 stars because at this price point above average is remarkable. My favorites are the Grilled Chicken Bun Noodle Bowl. &#160;It's not quite Tamarind Tree or Ba-Bar but it's close and for $7.95 it's a bargain. &#160;My other fav's are the shrimp toast and the spring rolls. On the darkside....the service can be spotty and even snotty sometimes; &#160;the bathrooms are 3rd world so don't go in them-hold it! If you were in Saigon, would you expect anything else?? Pho Cyclo has been the go-to place for a tasty but not too spendy dinner for the boyfriend and I for a couple years now. We do live just a couple blocks away, so this isn't a "drives for hours to eat here" review. -The food is reliably good (hovering between 3 and 5 stars, neither BF or I have had bad food experiences). BF always gets pho, and I've tried a bunch. The rice noodle dishes are my favorite, and their spring rolls are super good. -The service isn't super great, but I think that's largely due to the language barrier. They're all friendly though, and we've never waited too long to be seated, have our orders taken, or for the food to arrive. The worst that happens is that you wave your hand at one of the servers walking by, but they always respond pretty promptly helpfully.-The bathrooms are basic, clean, nothing grody or uncomfortable.-I really enjoy the atmosphere, what with the paintings and the tinsy color-changing/blinking lights, and the paper lanterns. It's a pretty place! Doesn't feel too crowded, even when it's full.-The Vietnamese Sandwiches! They are tasty. Saigon Deli's are cheaper, but &#160;not by much and Pho Cyclo's are definitely worth it. Call ahead and pick up the sandwiches for extra easiness.I was thinking about giving this place 4 stars, what with the service being not-amazing and the food occasionally being worth 3 or 4 stars instead of 5. But then, I realized that we keep coming back here, and haven't had any notably bad experiences, so they deserve all 5 stars. Solid fresh spring rolls with shrimp 'n pork. The chicken salad (lemongrass/charbroiled chicken) was good stuff. Motorcycle parking is just down the street. My table was slightly wobbly... Good broth, good portion size and good service As a Vietnamese who lives in Seattle, I am really enjoy the place. The food is awesome and it's not that expensive too. The only downfall is the bathroom is not the cleanest. This is my default pho place on the hill. The broth is delicious and the sprouts/veggies always seem fresh. The meat seems to be good quality and always heaped high in my bowl. I also have enjoyed their pork/vermicelli bowl and their banh mi in the past. Although I usually opt for a bowl of pho and an iced Vietnamese coffee. &#160;Service is quick - albeit leaving quite a bit to be desired (hence the -1 star). I've been ignored completely for 15 minutes here before and they are usually kind of rude/aggressive. I can ignore the service issues for fast, cheap and delicious any day though. Went here on a recommendation from a Seattle resident and I haven't been really been a big fan of other similar places. Until I went here and had the special bun thit nuong. I was first taken by the charbroiled pork nicely marinated and grilled. The pickled carrot and daikon slaw was perfect complimenting the meat and matchstick sliced cucumbers. I would recommend this place to give it a try. Service was excellent and friendly. Food was served without much waiting. Great place.
Service is horrible! I'm sorry, but you should be better staffed on a Saturday! We walked in and wait to be seated. We stood around like idiots even though there were empty tables that could fit us. Asked for a high chair and they told us they only had 2, but they were being used. They told us that they'd bring one over when it was available. But they never did. We were seated but no menu's were given to us. We waited for a while but no one came back so we walked up to the counter to grab our own. Took forever to get our order in, and to get our food. It took us over 45mins from sit down to get our spring roll appetizers and Pho! This is a Pho shop not a steakhouse! Pretty ridiculous. To top everything off the broth tasted bland. I get that you're busy but horrible customer service and bland food will not bring people back. I will definitely not be going back there. The service in here is highly questionable. Every time I've come here with a friend, it's taken us forever and six days to get our bill. We actually decided to bring out our sleeping bags and pillows last time we came.Not really. Instead, we had to go and retrieve someone to get the bill. Also, I know I'm a soft-spoken person, but not THAT soft spoken and one particular person always has a hard time understanding me. And I'm not gonna yell, right? I don't know if they're hard of hearing, or if they just don't speak much English, but either way, that person should not be taking orders. Coconut juice, dude. That's all I ever want.Anyway, the pho is alright! That's seriously all I got. I was lazy, so gave pho cyclo ANOTHER try. Worst service in town, they forgot our drinks, forgot our spring rolls, and were painfully slow. My food came a full 15 minutes before my friend's, and he was starving. We were finally able to flag them, and, oh, yup. You guys totally forgot his bun. Awesome.My food? Blah. Big, big, big blah. Pho Cyclo had some of the best pho in town. I don't know why they stopped giving a crap about their broth. It's awful.Somewhere out there, baby Jesus is crying because of the shitty restaurant you've become, Pho Cyclo. It's depressing. Holy Pho! Love this place. I don't know I haven't been here before, but it might be my new fav (if not, it's up there!).The difference maker - I love the sauce that comes with the pho! It is sweet but spicy. I also like the ratio of veggies to tofu and the cut of the noodles. The broth is also great.For the price, yes this place rocks. I will be back here within a few days. I'm consumed in the Cyclo now! YUM. PHO. BAM. Have you ever wished you had the power of invisibility? &#160;Well, here's the place to go!A friend and I walked in and stood there for about fifteen minutes before even being acknowledged by staff. &#160;The couple in front of us experienced a similar wait.So, after finally being seated, we wait... and wait... fifteen minutes later, someone brings us water. &#160;We ask for a server, and no one comes. &#160;Ten minutes later, we actually just got up and left. &#160;Worst service ever. &#160;A thirty-five minute wait with no server taking our order when the place is not fully busy is ridiculous. &#160;You are much better off going to Than Brothers a few blocks down, where the food is delicious and cheaper with lightning fast service.A simple search for the word "service" throughout other Yelpers' comments will confirm the horrible service at this place.However, if you ever want to simply die by starvation, this is the place for you. Two things that make me love this place: 1) They take debit/credit cards (I lose cash like it's nobody's business)2) They serve alcohol (hair of the dog never did anybody any harm)The Pho is great here, best hangover cure north of Central America (sopa de pata knocks out the meanest of hangovers!). Service is slow here, don't expect to be in and out in less than half an hour. But I was with great company so it wasn't a deal breaker for me. With Than Brothers being my favorite pho place, it's hard to pass up seeing as it's just up the street, but if I find my wallet paper moneyless and I feel like having a beer with my pho, then this is the place to go. It's cute inside too, which adds to the appeal. Go here for your Pho fix!They make other Vietnamese dishes - banh mi, vermicelli bowls, and combo rice plates, but their specialty and the standout is their pho. They have the best pho broth on the hill, as good as the small pho shops in Little Saigon. I always cringe when I see people (friends and my boyfriend included) adding oyster sauce, siracha, and pepper to the broth before actually tasting it. You might need to do that elsewhere, but not here. Another thing that I love about Pho Cyclo is that they don't skimp on their meat or tofu (if you are getting the veggie pho). They have enough combinations to please people like my Dad who gets his pho with tripe, tendon, fatty flank, meatballs, etc.Finish off with their delicious Vietnamese iced coffee - really strong brewed coffee sweetened with condensed milk to avoid the post-pho coma. This is my favorite Pho place. &#160;It is quick, cheap and delicious. &#160;If I am craving Pho then I hit Pho Cyclo. &#160;It is awesome. I used to like this place, largely because the service and cleanliness was superior to its competitor a little ways up Broadway that I used to go to. &#160;Lately however, the service is so bad and the food so mediocre that they've lost my business. &#160;I'm not interested in spending money at a restaurant in which I feel like I'm inconveniencing this wait staff with my desire to purchase their product. &#160;There is plenty of Vietnamese food in this town, I'm taking my business to a place with better service. Very cold inside in the winter. &#160;Really bizarre and annoying music. Food isnt that much better than the "discount" Pho places nearby. &#160;They lost our order which ended up taking over 40 minutes for us to receive a bowl of Pho. &#160;I'm not planning on returning. So disappointed! Service was so bad: it took way too long for them to serve us especially when there was hardly anyone there. My meal came after close to 10 minutes of my friend receiving hers...they never refilled our water nor tea either. Overall, the food was good but quality of pork on #16 wasn't great. &#160;Wouldn't go back :( Good pho. Love the fresh spring rolls with fish sauce. Quick service. Uppers-Plenty of seating-What I would call, exotic, sophisticated mushrooms (in part, because I don't know the species!)-Speedy serviceDowners-Lacking on noodles for a large-Hard veges as others have noted (I don't mind though)-Price. &#160;You'll walk away down at least 10.-Plastic chop sticks. &#160;I'll keep campaigning for this...bamboo has SO much more grip!The ScoopI popped in here today for the very first time and got what I expected. &#160;Nothing wrong or fantastic about that. &#160;If you're looking for a place to quench your Pho fix, Pho Cyclo definitely has you covered. &#160;*The Vege Pho I ordered had a 'healthy' amount of Tofu in it. &#160;I noticed a review from a year ago noted it was absent! Decent Viet food, if you live in the neighborhood and want quick and easy. I would never drive from another part of the city to eat here. Go to the ID!The service here borders disrespectful. The staff is not friendly and makes you feel a bit uncomfortable. The food arrives at separate times and you do not always eat with your company.2 stars. Meh. I've experienced better. To my admission the pho is decent but the service is terrible. The staff there look pretty unhappy and their misery shows in the way you're being served as a paying customer. The woman who appears to be the manager there seems to dictate the overall mood there. I will never eat there again, it's not worth it. this place......frustrating! &#160;a dichotomous asian eatery of appetizing food manned by an inconsistent wait staff. &#160; on one hand, the food is good. &#160;at times, great. &#160;probably the goodest vietnamese you will find this side of Jackson. &#160;the bun and spring rolls are tasty, the prices are decent, and the won ton soup is the best bowl on cap hill. &#160;they give you so many shrimp!! &#160; but on the other hand, the service is atrocious. &#160;so bad. &#160;the first few times i came here, things were fine. &#160;but for the last year....it's as if the wait staff just gave up. &#160;on my third, vestigial hand, the location is great. &#160;right on broadway, close to my house. &#160;here is my last experience, which, sadly, is typical: after being seated, 10 minutes later we received water. &#160;my friend and i each order a large won ton soup. &#160;so easy. &#160;half hour later we received our bowls of won ton, with one small plate of bean sprouts on the side. &#160; no silverware, chopsticks, or napkins. &#160;i approach the front desk and ask for two sets. &#160;i am a won ton vet. &#160;i know things! &#160; i know that their won ton comes with bean sprouts, basil, lime, jalapenos, and ginger sauce. &#160; with these simple ingredients i can craft a perfect bowl. &#160;no wait staff approaches our table for 10 minutes; i make my way to the front (again) and ask for the goods. &#160;eventually, a waiter brings out one serving of ginger sauce, and nothing else. &#160;i stop him before he leaves the table and i ask if my friend can have one as well....he gave me a puzzled look and asks if i meant chop sticks. &#160;HE ASKED ME IF I MEANT CHOP STICKS. &#160;i pointed at the sauce bowl, he gave a nod and scurried back to the kitchen. &#160;we never saw him again. &#160;we began eating. &#160;it tasted good! &#160;even without basil. &#160;and for a while, things were fine. &#160;after a few minutes i begin to notice that my bowl is almost gone and i am still hungry. &#160;my friend and i look to the next table, and their bowls are MUCH bigger. &#160;their smiles, MUCH larger. &#160;i wave a waitress down and ask if we had received small bowls instead of the sizes we ordered. &#160;she giggles and says yes, and asks if we want some spring rolls (?). &#160; to make things easy on everyone involved, i say yes. &#160;i assumed that these were on the house, to make up for charging us for large bowls. &#160; to their credit, the spring rolls were good. &#160;but after everything that has happened, we are more than ready to pay and leave. &#160;the check comes, and we notice that we have indeed been billed for the spring rolls. &#160; altho my review may sound mocking....i know that this place has the potential to be great. &#160;i used to get good service here! &#160;and the food, when they get your order right, is delicious. &#160;plenty of shrimp. &#160;so, i will be back, armed with the knowledge that nothing comes easy at this place. &#160; &#160;tooth and nail for everything. &#160;on a sidenote: &#160;to the short moustache'd waiter with the chip on his shoulder....the one who mean mugs us every time we eat here....what. &#160;is. &#160;your. &#160;problem? &#160; &#160; &#160;i know you're probably thumbing my soup. Great pho. Awful service. I had been here a couple of times prior to my experience the other night, and while the service was nothing special on these nights it was particularly awful. Took a while to get seated, despite the fact that there were a number of open tables (on a Friday). And once we were seated it took FOREVER for them to take our orders. Food arrived decently quickly, and it was delicious as usual, but the service at the end of our meal is what really has me thinking about not going back. We finished eating. And then we waited.We were chatting, but it was clear that we were ready to pay our bill. I made eye contact with some of the waiters/servers/busses (who do not appear to have clearly defined jobs), but nobody came over. Eventually, maybe 10-20 minutes after we finished eating I went up to the counter to ask for the check and some to-go boxes for my girlfriend's leftover soup. Five minutes later the guy comes over and boxes up the food. But no bill. We wait another 5 minutes, estimate the bill cost, leave cash, and walk out.Did I say I was considering trying again? After writing this review I definitely won't be. I had their chicken sandwich, take out.I figured I'd avoid the horrible service I've been hearing about and do take out. They still managed to basically ignore me the whole time and take forever just to grab my sandwich which was sitting behind the counter.The sandwich was fine. Very thrown together, but it was very cheap so it makes sense. I love this place. The Tofu Bun is delicious and addictive. The portions are huge and I can rarely finish it all. &#160;The decor is outrageously awesome, over-the-top in a fantastic kind of way. &#160;People complain about the service. I've never had a problem but I don't exactly expect the servers to do much more than drop the food off and walk away--it costs like $8 to eat here. &#160;Another reason to keep coming back! I have been coming to Pho Cyclo for years. &#160;At first, just the one on 1st Ave. S. and now the Broadway location. &#160;I love their Pho and their stir-fry's are also really good. &#160;My 'usual' dishes are one of the following: &#160;Pho Tofu (w/ chicken broth), lemongrass chicken stir-fry, or the pork skewers (which comes w/ a light sauce that is perfect!). &#160;The lemongrass is pretty spicy, but the perfect 'kick'. &#160;The food is always consistently good at Pho Cyclo. &#160;It's just too bad the service wasn't the same. &#160;I agree w/ the previous posts that the service is slow. &#160;And it is weird how they do seem to ignore their customers at times. &#160;I can't tell if they just need to hire an additional wait person, or they are just that bad. &#160;In fact now I order immediately when they seat me to avoid any frustration. &#160;The food is worth it, though, as long as you bring your patience with you! Idk where the pho to start with this review,food is ok......the service is is terrible as pho,I went there for my very first time on a Sunday for lunch with my friends,after waiting for 15 minutes we finally got seated,me and my friend we both ordered the coconut bubble tea and some appetizers ,we got our appetizers and I ask our server for our drinks,he said they were coming,he took our orders and after a long wait we finally got our food but not our drinks,I asked(again)Where the pho our drinks were,the server replied again they were on their way,after we finished our food(which was good btw) with no drinks we finally got them with no apologies nothing,the drinks were just as disgusting as the manager's face after we complain about them,they tasted it like someone just douche their asshole with coconut milk and pour the waste in to a cup,the bitch had the nerve to talk back to me,she was like:that's fresh coconut bubble tea I made it myself,so they shouldn't be any problems,I was like You pho-king Bitch!!! There's 2 people complaining for the same shit,I ain't &#160;drinking this vagina water or whatever the pho it is and I better not get charge for it!!!!I'll never return to this pho-king place again,avoid at all cost!!! The rice Noodle dishes are yummy. However service is always horrible here. The guys are lazy and never seem to smile! The older lady is nice occasionally. Don't expect to get additional service once you get your food. First of all let me start by saying that the only reason I was going to this restaurant was because my cousin and I were on a tight schedule and Than Bros. down the road wasn't open yet.We get in, sit down, and when we finally flag a guy he says, "What you want". Uhh, food? We get the food, the noodles aren't that great, and with pho I think this is something pretty important- not to mention not that hard to master! The broth was pretty good, the chicken was better than Than Bros. honestly which is the only reason I'm not completely poo-pooing this place.They also messed up my cousin's order, it could have just been a missed communication but with the feel these guys were puttin' off it's hard to say. All she said was no onions please and she ends up with no meat, double noodle, and onions. If she had been deathly allergic to onions... well we probably wouldn't be at a pho place.All in all there are much better and worse pho places out there I'm sure, this one just isn't my style I guess. I'm more of a three words tops relationship with my wait staff kinda gal, and usually if they give me food really fast and it doesn't taste terrible and isn't completely wrong this is easy to achieve. I don't like being rude to people or people being rude to me. I can understand people have bad days, but everyone in the restaurant?! Who died! I'm torn...The food deserves 5 stars. It's always delicious and fresh. Best pho I've ever eaten. HOWEVER, everything else about the restaurant deserves a 1.5 at best. The service is the worst, and the restaurant always smells like somebody spilled bleach everywhere. Expect to wait 25-30 minutes (at least) for your pho, even if everyone at your table orders pho. As delicious as the food is, it's debatable whether it's worth the wait and loss of valuable brain cells that eating there will cause you. Damn...I dislike the service...and I was near the door this afternoon so whenever people came in or left I got cold...BUT...Damn...their pho is tasty...I should know since I'm Viet...haha...Their cuts of beef and their broth...they are doing something funky and good in the kitchen...their dipping sauce was better years ago when it had more bite...but not complaining...1st place - Pho Cyclo2nd place - Pho So' 1 (see other review)3rd place - Thanh Brothers (on a good day) Personally, I find this is a place for a quick bite Pho. If you are looking for a decent Vietnamese restaurant with great service, I will recommend Green Leaf in international district. Pho doesn t taste like pho I ordered well done Meat , didn't come out well done is not authentic Vietnamese pho,bean sprout come with spiky greenLeaf at other places not this one,bathroom is graffiti All over ,men urinal is cover with a plastic bag
We wandered here for a quick bite before a SIFF film. We had about 45mins before the movie started, so we had to MOVE.I've heard about Pho Cyclo for some time. It's open late'ish for those hankerin' for some pho. But they had other menu items, like rice dishes, noodle dishes, and of course...banh mi.The inside of the restaurant is huge and cute! Large murals paint a Vietnamese street (one of the nicer ones) and the windows open out onto the sidewalk on nice sunny days.The hub ordered lemon grass chicken with rice and I ordered a banh mi. Two fresh spring rolls to share. Of course, I had to ask if they had it 'dac biet' style..and busted out my Vietnamese to ask. The girl regretfully told me they did not. I then ordered pork and politely asked if we could get out of here within 30mins.In 5mins the rolls appear. They do have shrimp, which I am sometimes allergic to, but it was good. The dipping sauce was just okay...I like a nice thick creamy peanut sauce or else my mom's nuoc mam. A few moments pass and our entrees are here. Yay! Thank the hook-up that is using my native language. YUUUUS! (Not really though, I'm sure they are just that attentive, heh.)The pork banh mi was quite nice. The usual ingredients--fresh cilantro, pickled carrots/jicama, cucumber, jalapeno on a perfect baguette. Just enough BBQ pork with some crispiness and char from the grill. It also came with a side salad (did not know this) w/ a lite dressing and a whole sliced tomato. The hub's chicken was quite tasty and cooked to just right (I was a little skeptical because it came out so fast). We were in and out in 35mins, and it was about $15. :)
I love this place, it is in walking distance to my house, so I stop by sometimes on the way home. There is no seating and sometimes the parking lot can be a little sketch, but it is worth the food. When I go here I usually get the fried oysters. It comes with 6-7 really large cornmeal rolled and soft fried oysters, a large portion of fries, a small salad, and french bread for $10.95. I never finish my food. I have also had the shrimp po'boy, and being that I have actually eaten po'boys in New Orleans, it is pretty dead on the same. I cannot complain. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I came one night thirty minutes before closing and they turned the fryers off. :-( But the food always calls me back. C'est Si BON !!! (it is GOOD) First visit was good. The chicken wing dinner was excellent,served with beans and rice. Also, very good. &#160;Second visit the joint wasnt open at 11am had a sign saying open at 12..wtf? Third visit prices all changed not in our favor of course, and the chicken has been eliminated from the menu! wtf! dont get my taste buds rollin then flake off!! I got the chicken and sausage gumbo with mac and cheese just to try it out. I'm pretty impressed. Tastes good and not too expensive. I hope they can expand to more options and maybe have a sit down option soon. Hope it stays around!
In wandering my new neighborhood this evening while trying to find an uncrowded restaurant to celebrate my New Year's Eve as a single chick, this is what I stumbled across. &#160;I was very, very pleased in my selection here!9:15pm, managed to be their last customer they served for the evening and yet they were just as courteous and non-rushed as if I wasn't one of the few people keeping them from closing up earlier. &#160;Cozied up to the bar originally planning on placing my order to-go, but because of the comfortable atmosphere, I decided to stay. &#160;NYE revelers were filling 95% of the place, and yet not the annoying, "Woo-Hoo!" type that I'd wish boiling soup to spill on. &#160;Just a quaint, more mature crowd than what was wandering outside-- and I very much appreciated that. &#160;Plus in sitting at the bar, I had the full-on entertainment of watching the open kitchen and cooks work their sweaty magic, plus a television tuned into the last 5 minutes of the Sonics game (something I haven't seen in weeks since I don't have a TV yet) and surprisingly comfortable bar seats, so I was hooked.The food was a bit greasier than I would like (and thus the one less star), but it was none-the-less delicious. &#160;My plain-Jane taste buds ordered &amp; fully enjoyed the starter of bite-sized spring rolls (the sweet &amp; sour sauce accompanying it was SO tasty) and the tofu pad thai, which surprised me in being just a bit different than most I've had before and thus more delicious. &#160;More vegetables speckled about, things like shaved carrots and steamed broccoli and the like... things that I normally would NOT be touching unless, like it was here, they are deeply enhanced in flavor by the sauce they are soaking in. &#160;Thank you, I almost feel as if I ate a healthy meal!Portions on main meal are large enough that I took half of it home in a baggie-- probably to be my first warm meal of 2008! &#160;Washed down with a Pyramid Hef, and the appetizer, beer, and dinner including tax &amp; tip came to $21. &#160;I was very pleasantly surprised with the impromptu decision to eat here, and most importantly I cannot wait to return soon. Great ambience. &#160;I like this place mainly because you can see them cooking the food in the center of the restaraunt. &#160;I love the layout and think the food is good. &#160;This is a great place to eat before going down to Seattle Center for an event. &#160;The food is good, the portions are perfect and the price is right. &#160;My favorite dish here so far has been the beef salad. &#160;Very tasty and with the lime it is just right. This is not the best Thai restaraunt in Seattle but a very good one for this area. &#160;It is competing with Racha down the street which is much more pricey but has a more interesting menu. I've always loved Thai food. My friends and I would always joke about the pronunciation of the name while we passed it by on our way to Easy Street Records, Dicks, or The Vera Project. &#160;We finally tried it last summer, and the food was delicious. The portions were precise, just enough to fill you up. The booths were funky,and &#160;the cushions were comfy. Overall, loved it. I'm a big fan of their lunch menu...two main dishes, a side salad and rice for only $8.99....swweeeettt...I usually go with the chicken Panang and Phad Thai, but pretty much all the dishes are equally good.Let's be honest though, LQA (or Uptown as the yuppies like to call it) has many Thai options and while Phuket is pretty good, for Phad Thai I prefer Rice 'N Spice and for everything else I prefer Tup Tim Thai. When I can't decide on one or the other though, I just use Phuket as my compromise. Pretty good tasting thai, nothing super special like triple T down the street, but they are closed on Sundays so what are you gona do?Just be warned, there is a dinner combo special on the menu where you choose 3 dinner entres for $17.50 as opposed to the $9 per plate. Now while I wouldn't expect the portions to be as big as the normal ones, three tiny pieces of chicken on the Garlic Broccoli dish is a bit crazy (we each got one, so at least we each TASTED the chicken). Ah well. This place inspired me to plan my trip to Phuket next spring! NO JOKE! well, not really, but it definitely helped.This place is awesome. I first went on my birthday last year. Was a Saturday around 6, and there were 8 of us. No reservations (i know, we are bastards). They sat us NO PROBLEM! in their funky cool booths up top. The food is amazing. The staff is a bit odd--not super friendly, but i think it may be a cultural thing ... they always look at me like they want to ask me really personal questions but are too embarrassed to. It's funny, really. Every time i visit this place, i grow more and more obsessed with the food. I'm typically a 'sweet and sour' type girl (AND that's the dish i typically order, too) ... but this place is so good, i trust that every dish on the menu rocks, so i am able to try different things every time. And am NEVER disappointed. Mmmmmm Thai food. Phuket is so convenient to where I live, I don't know why I don't come here EVERY day. Probably because Tup Tim Thai is closer, and I don't want to get fat.I haven't had a bad dish here. The servers are considerate, but last time we came it took an extremely long time to get our check. Maybe because we had beers left. Who knows.Spring rolls are good, everything is just awesome. Thai iced tea, I love you. I like to pronounce the U as an O because that's how I roll.It's cute, and the foods pretty yum too. Most amazing Thai food I've ever had. We ate here as tourists and now we eat here as locals. Love love love the pad gro pao (or however the hell you spell it). The pad se ew is amazing too. They have an open kitchen where you can watch your food being prepared, which is neat. It's clean and has dim lighting and good service. Hot in the summer, eat outside if you can! Average thai food, decent prices. Had the phad thai. Nothing spectacular but still good and big portions. Also tried the fried tofu, yummy sauce! I just got back from Phuket. &#160;The food was satisfying and good, however the restaurant was FREEZING. &#160;We got hot tea which was lukewarm. &#160;The restaurant was so cold that our food cooled almost immediately. &#160;Luckily we got 3 stars so the spiciness made up for the cold a little. &#160;I would definitely get food there again, but I now understand why so many people were getting takeout, it's not a great place to dine in.
Good thai food in the Queen Anne area of Seattle. Though the food is good, the choices are minimal. You'll find your usual curry dishes and a few noodle dishes thai there. Thai experimental eating this isn't. Phuket! &#160;Foooo-kette. &#160;This is my favorite Thai food in Seattle. &#160;The food is great, the prices are totally low, and everyone who works there is SO NICE. &#160;The restaurant has gold walls, I mean, how much better does it get? &#160;They have booths with comfy pillows so if you scarf a few too many noodles, you can have a rest. &#160;Most of the food is prepared in an open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant, so if you sit on the right side of the space or the counter, you can watch the chef in action. &#160;I highly recommend the Tom Kah soup, Pineapple Curry Fried Rice, and any of the noodle dishes. &#160;Good, easy, and reliable. I love this place so much! It's so cute, and I always feel like they are so nice whenever I come here. I love the name, for obvious reasons! I'm well aware that Phuket with an American pronunciation might suggest cutting corners, but rest assured this Thai restaurant is customer pleasing, fulfilling every expectation. &#160;Great atmosphere with authentic decor, flying dragons and all...Great service...Unique booths with wedged cushions and elborately stitched pillows...and of course, absolutely amazing food. &#160;Finish it all off with mango and sticky rice and you'll be happily surprised with the extremely reasonable price. &#160;I found my new favorite Thai, jet set not necessary. &#160;Cheers!
It wasn't quite what I had remembered from studying abroad in Kenya, but it was still good. I was only there for 10 weeks but seeing as I gained 10 pounds eating Kenyan food during that time, I'll give myself some credit and say that I know at least something about Kenyan food.For $35, we had chai (Kenyan black tea with milk and sugar), a beef samosa (which was a delicious appetizer and flavorfully spiced), samaki (a whole fried tilapia) with githeri (a mix of beans and veggies) and chapati (fried flatbread), and goat with collard greens and ugali (a cornmealy lump of starch meant to be eaten with veggies and meat). I'm not sure if I'm being entirely objective here, given all the raving reviews but I'd give the food just 3 stars -- the goat was kind of bland and the fish was very flavorful but a bit too oily and the yellow coconut sauce that it came with was very heavy. The githeri was most certainly not authentic, since it looked like a bag of frozen mixed carrots/corn/beans that had been reheated with a few kidney beans thrown in. However, Safari Njema gets 4 stars despite the 3 star food because of their great music, the fun paintings decorating the restaurant, and the friendly service of the waitress and the chef who came out to talk to us. Note that is a little hard to find: going South on Rainier Ave, it'll be on your right in the middle of a strip mall, about half a block after you pass the The Royal Room. Amazing. &#160;Amazing. &#160;Amazing.While the menu isn't extensive, everything on it is so good. &#160;The beef is fantastic, the goat is pretty darn good and everything is authentic and delicious. &#160;I will definitely be going back as often as possible. Really great home cooked meal!It takes a while for Jane to prepare everything, but that's OK because it is all prepared fresh on the spot! Get an appetizer to hold you over.Lovely hospitality and lovely food - highly recommend! When you find a place that cooks like your mom you really have to just relax and enjoy. First of all just want to say this is a Halal place so you can enjoy without asking.So as usual I try and get out and experience places I have not been exposed to in my community. We went and the place is right beside Full Tilt Ice Cream so it was easy to find because who out there does not like a find a cool ice cream shop.The place is very non assuming but what it lacks in decor it makes up with the owner Jane coming out and editing your order. Jane is by far an important part of the shop and her coming out and really connecting to the customers.. quickly making them family.As soon as I went in I saw items that were part of my youth. All that yummy goodness was there to eat and all of it was there but I only had a small stomach to take it all in. We had the Mandazi and it was very good snack I was looking on the menu for some Barazi to dip the Mandazi in but did not find it. But the Mandazi was so good and I recomend it &#160;to all of you to try, its not too sweet but has a subtle sweetness.Then the Somosas, with the house hot sauce was all together very very good. The beef in the meal is well spiced and subtle with its flavors.Next was my dear moms favorite dish Badjia, again dipped in the house hot sauce is very good. You might wonder if you should try this but please honor my mom and &#160;your taste buds this is a very nice treat. Sliced potatos dipped in seasoned gram flower and fried goodness.Now for what I had for my main meal. fried whole fish (yes with the fish head) seasoned nicely with a cocunut sauce. I took the fish apart from its bones and enjoyed every bit of the while fish meat. Please take the time and visit this gem in the city and enjoy and let Jane know your tastes becasue she will make it to order. Going back for sure. You could cite the spicy rice, generous portions, boss-of-me hot sauce, or the pre-prandial bouquets that waft and delight as your meal is prepared. But you'd miss the main dish on this place. Above all, the Safari serves hospitality. The tasty and exotic food is generously seasoned with extravagant cheer and energetically welcoming wait-staff. That combination will high-five your taste buds and tickle your soul. Perpetual sunshine in Seattle---who knew? WOW!!! &#160;This place is incredible. &#160;We showed up in a group of 10, completely unannounced to discover that the owner was all by herself for the night (it was super bowl sunday). &#160;Despite this, she was amazingly friendly and energetic. &#160;It did take a while to get our food, but not only was this understandable, I think she did it surprisingly fast considering how much food we ordered. &#160;The food was absolutely incredible!! &#160;I've tried home cooked Kenyan food a couple of times before, and this was spot on authentic, and prepared with wonderful technique (the owner told me she was a Cordon Bleu graduate). &#160;I would highly recommend this restaurant (and already have many times) to anybody, even those who are picky eaters. &#160;My mother is a self-proclaimed picky eater and had a ball here. &#160;Try the chicken. &#160;It is prepared so well, that despite being a red meat fan, this was my favorite dish! &#160;And don't forget a Kenyan tea (think Indian chai with more cardamom). Delicious and authentic food, and they have an excellent home-made hot sauce. This place is excellent!! The owner is very friendly, the food is fresh and well-prepared. My 12 yr old son proclaimed the fries the best he'd ever had. The meat and vegetables were delicious! Amazing! &#160;The food was delicious. &#160;However, the service was a little slow &amp; the menu small. &#160;But it was great! Great food, and the people were wonderful. Will definitely be coming back! Having lived in Kenya, I can testify that this is not only authentic Kenyan food, but some of the best we've had. &#160;Jane is a master chef, and like other reviewers have said, you feel like you're with family when she comes out to greet you. &#160;Seriously, the fried whole tilapia (fish) tastes so good I felt like I was back on the shore of Lake Victoria in Western Kenya. &#160;This is now a regular place for us. We had a large group, so pre-arranged for a "family dinner" that included appetizers, 3 starches, 3 veggies, and 3 meats, served family style. Wonderful food, freshly prepared. Very friendly service. A family run operation. Free parking in the lot. Have the fruit salad at the end of the meal before you go for homemade ice cream at the shop next door. The food was amazing and so was the service! I had to try it out and everything I've read on Yelp about Safara Kenyan restaurant is true. It's a bright and comfortable restaurant and you're immediately made to feel welcome by the owner/chef, Jane. &#160;She's genuinely warm and friendly when she takes your order and thoughtfully points out when something else on the menu might go better with a main dish. The Beef samosas are out of this world. &#160;I had an idea of what the samosa might be like (like indian samosa) and it's not -- the beef is delightfully sauteed with scallions and some magical, secret combo of hot spices and herbs. I haven't had anything like it before. &#160;The collards/spinach side dish is cooked perfectly. And the chicken is served in a delightful and light sause. I also really enjoyed the Kenyan Tea. Like another reader remarked, it's like Chai, and a real treat to drink a big, piping hot cup of it. &#160;I'm looking forward to go back again. &#160;What a fun night and neighborhood. &#160;-Thank you!
A friend and I came for lunch to try out Kastoori Grill for the first time. We were both impressed! I had the chicken tikka masala medium spicy. The portion size was generous. I also got garlic naan and a mango lassi. Lassi was $3.50, naan was $3 I think and the tikka masala was $15. Prices are pretty standard for Indian food.The sauce was really good. The only thing was that the chicken was just a tiny bit rubbery. This could mean it was a tad overcooked. Other than that the dish was very good. Great flavor in the sauce. I would order this again for sure. I liked the rice and naan, too. Lassi was good, nothing out of the ordinary. I tasted my friend's tandoori salmon and it was amazing. I think I'll get that next time! Service was pretty good. Service often times is hit or miss during the buffet hours. There were lots of Indians eating here which is a good sign. I'll definitely be back when in the area. This is the best Indian food I've had downtown! The kitchen is near the entry and visible from the dining area, but without adequate ventilation. &#160;There was a constant smoky spicy haze in there, and our clothes absolutely reeked like a freakin' Indian household afterward. &#160;Also, felt kinda grungy in there for some reason.. Food was good though. &#160;Excellent tandoori-cooked meats. &#160;I'll agree with other reviewers that the sauces are less sweet and creamy than many other places offer (it's probably more authentic, which is good) &#160;A 3-out-of-5 stars on the heat level in the curry was spicier than I anticipated. &#160;Service was friendly. &#160;Value-wise, average. Go here, not for the ambience, but for the best Indian/Nepalese food around. You get the aromas a block away! &#160;Treat your palate to a gastronomic flavor party. We had two different curries, the mango and the coconut cilantro and both were amazing. The people who work there, especially Suda, were very warm and friendly. It will be first on our list when we return to Seattle. This place has me craving Indian food as I type. Not much to look at from the outside or inside, for that matter, Kastoori Grill shines where it matters most - with delicious Indian and Nepalese/Tibetan fare.This review if for their buffet only. We haven't quite made it to dinner yet.The open kitchen as you enter the restaurant reminds me of kitchens back in India - warm and full of delicious aromas teasing one's already rumbling stomach. It never fails to entice me.The service is warm and friendly, and attentive enough. You are always greeted with a smile, no matter how rushed off their feet the two servers are.The buffet is *perfect*. Over my many visits, it's been consistently good - the flavours, the selections, and most importantly, they keep it hot and filled. They offer hot naans made fresh and brought to your table - no leathery, cold naans here. Their lamb curry is perfection. As are their dals and tandoori chicken.Do try the mango lassi. Perfect accompaniment to the meal - a touch tart, but just the right amount of sweetness.While it may not be a big deal for most diners, but the fact they they have cloth dinner napkins makes me SO happy. I really have a problem with eateries that offer sit down meals with paper napkins. Unless you are a fast food joint offering plastic ware - do refrain from doing that.But back to Kastoori - I am in love with their food. And I am so happy that they exist. Wow this is good food. &#160;Everything I've had here has been very good. &#160;I would have to say the best item I've had is the chicken tikka. &#160;The chicken comes out covered in a red dry rub that smells and tastes incredible. &#160;I brought in leftovers for work the next day and everyone was asking me where I got it. &#160;Also I'm a big eater and I had no problem getting full twice off my order of one dinner entree and one order of naan bread. &#160;I took a picture of it but that was after I had already taken a few bites. &#160;The service was warm and attentive. &#160;I'm always a little nervous about the cleanliness of these kinds of restaurants, but this one seemed pretty clean. &#160;You can see the kitchen line as soon as you walk in the door. &#160;The decor is not fancy, this is a casual place by the market with a dinner for one ranging $17-24 after tip. &#160;Highly recommend this place for a quick dinner or a night where you just don't feel like getting dressed up to go out or cooking. Tasty food, good service, and pleasant atmosphere! Had the buffet for lunch ($10 + includes a fresh individual naan) and they had a nice selection. There wasn't a huge variety but it was good quality. This will definitely be a regular spot for me! From scanning the other reviews on Yelp I saw that few focused on the happy hour menu. In town for a training, I saw a Living Social instant deal for here ($14 for $20). I decided to cruise by before committing to the deal. I'm glad I did, because I discovered it was happy hour and the menu looked promising. I wound up ordering the Chicken Chilly and the Chicken Mo Mo. I've said this before in other reviews, I don't necessarily know "authentic" with a lot of foods, so I tend to judge simply on the basis of how much I like it. And yes, I liked it! The flavor of the Chicken Chilly was fantastic and it was beautifully presented. I loved every bite. I had never had Mo Mo before, but will certainly have it again. The dipping sauce was good, but I became addicted to the tamarind chutney, so mostly used that. About the service: Fantastic. I was actually served by two people, a man and a woman. Both were very helpful and attentive. I had ordered the Chicken Chilly medium spicy. I tend to sweat profusely, and when she saw how much I was she became concerned the chef had made it too spicy. She was about to whisk it away and bring me a milder version! I assured her it wasn't the food, it was me, so they were VERY on top of keeping my water full.Ordering only the two happy hour items at $5.00 each and drinking only water I came out stuffed and my taste buds and wallet very happy. I highly recommend Kastoori Grill for their happy hour. I want to try their lunch buffet, but sadly, that will have to wait until my next trip to the west side. amazing tandoori - great service and staff. Mmmmm....yes.After one of my coworkers found a staple in his food at Pabla, we all knew the time had come to change Indian buffets. &#160;How can you effectively gorge yourself into a naan coma when you might be swallowing staples? &#160;Gurgle.The staff were all SO nice and pleasant. &#160;They refilled our water continuously, brought piping hot, fresh naan to our table, and smiled every time we got up to gorge ourselves again.Be sure to try the mango moose [sic]. &#160;It's delicious! &#160;:) The only option at lunch is the buffet. I assume they have a much different dinner menu, but I can't really confirm that.The lunch buffet is okay, but nothing terribly remarkable. Nothing was bad, but nothing was particularly fabulous, either. They do seem to have a decent selection of food - curries, butter chicken, paneer, veggie dishes. The naan was served steaming hot, and tasted really fresh, which I appreciated. Our water glasses were filled frequently, but there's not really much else to report upon. It looks like a decent place to grab lunch during the weekdays if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of your way for it. i would really say 3.5 stars but am bumping up because our appetizer was among the foods i would want to eat in heaven, were heaven a place where all your gastronomical wishes came true.the place is charmingly located near pike's place market and was a brief walk from our hotel, so ms. kim and i set out with good cheer, and upon entering kastoori grill, we were delighted at the pungent aromas wafting around. service was not good, which is why i really want to go to 3.5. we were seated promptly, and our water glasses were filled nonstop, but other than that, i would say the service was not good. yes, the place is busy, but it was nigh on impossible to make eye contact with any of the staff hustling by, no one ever checked in on how our food was, and this was indeed a problem, because even though i made a point of asking about dairy in the ordering process, it turned out there was dairy 2 of the dishes we ordered. granted, i asked about dairy in the appetizer, and the dairy showed up in 2 other dishes, but it doesn't take a brain surgeon to make the connection. if the girl doesn't want dairy in one appetizer, odds are she doesn't want it in her other one...back to the food. &#160;if you come, you simply MUST order the lasuni gobi--golden fried cauliflower florets in a sweet and sour garlic sauce. this was simply phenomenal. imagine your taste buds singing hallelujah as precious chunks of cauliflower dressed in this most flavorful, amazing sauce enter your gaping mouth. yes, that was what we experienced. BUT, along with these most precious cauliflower babies was a side of coleslaw. it took me over 5 minutes to get a staff member to confirm there was mayonnaise in it.my dinner, the mixed vegetable jal farezi, arrived with cubes of paneer in it. this was not mentioned on the menu, and again, it took almost 5 minutes of me trying to get someone's attention to verify that this was the only dairy in the dish. i'm not super picky, so i just made sure all the paneer was plucked out and given to ms. kim. when i finally did taste my dish, it was indeed tasty and appropriately spice. i would give it a 4.the garlic naan arrived some 10 minutes after our dinner; the garlic was suspiciously yellow. again, i tried in vain for a good 10 minutes to flag down a waiter to ask if the garlic naan was prepared with butter. turns out it was. ms. kim had a few bites and said t was too puffy and not chewy the way naan should be.as far as ms. kim's lamb vindaloo, which she has consumed at ample indian institutions over the years. she felt the preparation was classic; the lamb was well prepared and the dish had sufficient spice.we waited an excruciatingly long time for our bill as well. Solid deal! $9.95 for a buffet, and naan is made fresh and delivered shortly after you get back to your table. I enjoyed the lamb curry, the tandoori chicken, and the well done mint chutney. I am absolutely going back.
Killer, killer, killer lunch deal. You can't beat 12 humongous dumplings for $4.68. Seriously?! Seriously.The owner laughed when I ordered ice water instead of drinking the tea, being the ABC that I am (A stands for Arabian, hilariously). But in a nice way. She went over the menu with me, and was happy when I picked out the pork and napa cabbage dumplings.They were SO good and filling, and the sauce that came with it was homemade and VERY garlicky. The owner was so hospitable and warm, I felt like an aunt was feeding me until the bill came. Ah, reality.I want to try their beef noodle dish next. I love me some Northern Chinese comfort food! The first time I had dumplings was about a year ago at another restaurant in the ID and they were absolutely disgusting. But I decided to give dumplings a second chance at Ping's because I walk by every day and the place always has very satisfied looking diners...."omg so these are what dumplings are supposed to be like!? delicious!!!" An order of 12 dumplings for $5 is very filling....can't beat that! Anywhere I can buy a huge bag of frozen Xiao Long Bao gets five stars from me regardless of what else they do or do not sell, though admittedly I did pick up some nice dark black "Shanxi mature vinegar" and some premium Japanese sesame oil (according to the owner the Japanese brand was "superior") ;-)*I also had some delicious pork dumplings though admittedly the restaurant aspect of this shop isn't fully open yet, and I think they also go by Ping's Dumpling House as well. Can't wait for them to open then they'll be serving fresh made Xiao Long Bao! The dumplings were great. &#160;They came with a garlic sauce that was made right then that was amazing. &#160;And the people were really friendly, and for $5 I got a very filling meal.
This was a random choice one evening out. I figured Hawaiian food would be a somewhat interesting venture; I wasn't impressed by the food at all. The menu lacked in variety as did the drinks. The place just seemed slightly on the cheesy side for me. I will give props to the fantastic + attentive waitress. Overall the food just seemed bland to me. Like a stir-fry from a box. Plus white rice and fried tofu/fish. Meh is bleh. After finally trying this place I was amazed at the quality of the food and the service. It's perfect, and I'll be coming back for more. If you like your Hawaiian food fresh and served by friendly people, this is place to go! Hawaiian BBQ mix is amazing. Got back from Hawaii about a week ago and nothing even came close. Breeze simply has better quality ingredients and you can taste the difference. Great service as well. I live in woodinville and I make the journey multiple times a month to get my fix. Highly recommended This was my first time having Hawaiian food ever, and spam. &#160;I was pleasantly surprised at how well the spam complimented the soup I ate. &#160;The barbecue ribs were very tasty and the pasta salad was also a great compliment. &#160;Finally the coconut cream pie was amazing. &#160;I would recommend this place just for the desserts.All in all, the price was comparable to other restaurants in Wallingford and the food was satisfying if you are in the mood for something beyond pizza or thai. &#160;I will be back sooN! I used to have a craving for hawaiian breeze once or twice a month (ok sometimes more). &#160;I would get the combo and I loved it. &#160;Ninety-nine percent of the time I got a stomach-ache after the fact but it tasted so good that I put up with a little pain :) &#160;So that was my love/hate relationship with the place. &#160;Before my last visit, I probably would have given the place 4 stars.However, this last time I went, I wanted to make an adjustment to the combo plate. &#160;I really hate rice--I never eat it, and it goes to waste every time. &#160;So I wanted to see if they would replace the 2 scoops of rice with extra mac salad instead (because it's delicious). &#160;I checked out the prices, and a side of rice is 1.50, and a side of mac salad is 1.75. &#160;So I figured that since I was getting NO rice, they would charge me .50 cent more (.25 extra per scoop) for replacing the rice with the mac salad. &#160;Or, at the most, an extra 1.75. &#160;I understand that it can cost a bit more to be accomodated. &#160;Instead, they charged me 3.50. &#160;I got zero rice, and they still charged me the full price for the dish as well as an extra $4 for the change that I asked for. &#160;I don't think this was a fair charge--as I didn't get any rice and the price different b/t the rice and the mac salad was only .50 total. &#160;I am disappointed in the...customer service? of this business and I will never recommend it to my friends/coworkers (in fact I do the opposite). &#160;A stomach-ache and being gouged by the owners is NOT worth it.**I forgot to add that I had tried to call in advance to see what the price difference would be, and their phone was busy for a full 30 minutes. &#160;When I went there they realized it had been disconnected for about 30 minutes. Another annoyance. Scrumptous Hawaiian Barbecue mix. Super tasty with sweet BBQ glaze sauce that paired really well with the rice. Not so well with the macaroni salad that also came with it.The BBQ chicken yakisoba had a wonderful variety of non-mushy vegetables. Great flavor and just the right amount of tasty BBQ chicken.The Kalua pork was mushy and &#160;a bit salty to eat on its own or with the rice it was paired with, it might have been better in a bun to help the absorb some of the moisture and give a bland counter part to the salty flavor. I saw that they had a shave ice machine but it may be only a seasonal dessert as it didn't seem operational. I am looking forward to going back in warmer weather to check.Great video was playing when we were there of hula performances and Hawaiian musicians. Makes me wish I was in Hawaii again! Whenever I visit this place it is pretty empty but I think its because of the location. It is hard to find parking. The macaroni salad makes up for it. I love Kona Kitchen but I think the mac salad is better here than anywhere else. A cute restaurant, pretty small, has a cafe-vibe to it. I ordered a random dish, the ginger pork (was trying to err on the healthy side..ha). It came with two scoops of adequately cooked white rice, and a scoop of mac salad. &#160;There was a hefty serving of pork stir-fried with onions, laid on top of cabbage (eh? Am I supposed to eat this, or is it a part of the elaborate decoration?), garnished with some greens and a flower &#160; The pork was a tad on the dry side, and a little heavy on the ginger, but tasty enough for a famished customer. &#160; I did really enjoy the mac salad, though, which is usually my gauge for how good a hawaiian restaurant is. &#160;So, given that, the abundant rave reviews on yelp, and my admittedly poor order choice, I will have to give this place a second try. &#160;Next up, short ribs. i don't know why as i try more and more hawaiian restaurants, the bill seems to baloon bigger! on average, all item was about $9+. kind of expensive. spam musubi was $3. good thing was the waitress allowed us to be billed separately! that's superb!ordered the chicken katsu and spam musubi (a staple for hawaiian rest, at least to me!) and they taste pretty hawaiian and pretty standard. the dipping sauce was a misture of ketchup and the bulldog sauce. how i figure this out? it was not mixed evenly; there are 2 layers of sauce! i only realized after finishing the upper layer of the sauce, finding out that there's ketchup at the bottom!fried rice was not too bad, a tat sweet IMO. i got kind of sick of this after switching with my friend.. the pork katsu with curry was too salty IMO...however the BBQ chicken is worth mentioning! it was tasty! it's similar to teriyaki but tastier! must try IMO. also they're pretty meticulous in decorating their plates. each single plate has a fresh orchid on it. i was pleasantly surprised!however, i might return to this restaurant if i got bored of others due to the slightly expensive items... i'd do kona kitchen anyday!
Now you shouldn't jump to conclusions. &#160;Consider...if you like to argue with the wait staff when you claim something is not right (IE the wine tastes vinegary) and you like the extra protein a fly adds to your second wine to replace the first, then you might love Gordan Biersch. &#160;Add to that your salad not only doesn't deliver but tastes...uh..awful. &#160;I do like their beer but out of principal I wont be back. I love their garlic fries! The mushroom burger was mediocre. Service was pretty good though. Cocktails were pretty good. I have some of the coolest friends. &#160;Really. &#160;They are super awesome cool.Sometimes, they just don't wanna get wet.After a mandatory meeting at work (translation: severe group chastising), a couple of us decided that cocktails were in order. &#160;The one of us least likely to wander around in the rain suggested Gordon Biersch."But, I don't even LIKE beer.""Shut up. &#160;They have a bar."And, so, off to the mall we went.The Lemon Drop and Appletini were pretty good. &#160;The calamari was really just fried rubber bands.The steak (New York Strip) was unseasoned and a little gristly.The potato type side dish was almost inedible.Our waiter was really nice. &#160;He had a perma smile. &#160;He was young and fresh faced. &#160;I would like to meet him again in ten years just to take in the result of time on unmitigated joy. &#160;But, I digress...Decent place to wait for a movie to start, I guess. I just drank 3 Patron margs in 1.5 hours at Gordon Biersch- $5 each. They have four different margs to choose from- standard, fruity, classy. The Patron marg was delish- served UP in a martini glass. Apparently I made the same grimace on the first sip as I would have made with a first shot. Strong. &#160;I coupled them (is that still coupling?!) with &#160;the HH chicken wings and it was great. BONUS! It is Tuesday, and we sat on the "patio" and people-watched the people lining up to see "Baby Mama" with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. Apparently lotsa movies get released on Tuesdays? Who knew? Five stars for people-watching. &#160;My friend thought he was witnessing a "rehab club on a field trip". It was highly entertaining. The Service is OK, and the Food is OK. &#160;Nothing here is over the top. &#160;The service took too long, ordering drinks took too long, ordering our food took too long, getting refills on drinks took too long, getting our food took too long, EVERYTHING here just took too long. &#160;I have had &#160;my fair share of dine-in restaurants and man they sure do like to take their damn time. &#160;I honestly don't even know why Im giving them two stars. &#160;I ordered their sliders($10), came with some union rings. Thought they were going to be the size of a coaster like all sliders should come, but man these things were quarter sized burgers. &#160;I swear to god, if I wanted to, I could have eaten each slider in one bite. &#160;And on top of that the union rings were WEAK! &#160;I've had enough, and this is the end of the review. &#160;:/
So, I haven't actually been inside El Paisano, however, I have tried their carne asada and al pastor at barbecues with the Seattle Spanish Society, most recently last weekend. &#160;This is one of the places to go for organizing a carne asada on the beach or for picking up some quality meat. &#160;I'm sure when our group goes camping in the San Juans this summer we'll be getting some meat from there again. &#160;El Paisano and Carneceria Azteca are the best in town that I know of...Provecho cabron! The Al Pastor I got there was great. The Chicharones were good, but not the kind I like (it turns out there's a big difference between what they have here and the Chihuahuan style I'm used to from when I lived in NM). I will be back in the future. Agreed! This is the best place in Seattle to get good meat for a good, authentic Mexican meal. The chile sauces/salsas they make/sell are also amazing. I'm DYING to get the recipe for their green chile sauce. Does anyone have it? Know it? Willing to give it up? I don't care who I have to sleep with, I need to get this recipe!! Please share...
Still amazing, but BEWARE! If you used to get the yummy dense thick homemade steamed dumplings, they've changed the wrapper! &#160;We got loose, watery, thin, bad steamed dumplings the other night... &#160;Worst case scenario bad. &#160;When we asked them about it, they were happy to remake them the old way. &#160;SSPSR, the new dumpling wrappers are a travesty!!! &#160;Don't change something that was incredibly perfect to begin with!!! Great food. Servers can be hit or miss, like most Chinese places, it's in your interest to take charge and not be scared to flag down the waitstaff. But I've been there multiple times with a party 20, and they were able to handle us with reservations. Really enjoyed the food. &#160;Good value. Very good. Very spicy. Decadent and rich dishes. Amazing flavors. I love the onion "pancakes", hand-shaved noodles and mapo tofu. This is one if my favorite placed to go for hot pot in Seattle. The food is always good there. That's why my husband and I come there 3 or 4 time per month.However, this is a big however, the service has been terrible in recent at least two weeks. Don't know where the usual sweet polite and service-knowledgeable young lady goes. Instead, a rude, never-water-refilling and eager tip-asking lady serves there. We always leave very decent tips but we don't like people hinting at us in front of our face. At one moment I really decided not to leave tip for the 1st time. But then I thought of good food and usual good service so we still left what we usually did. Yummy yummy I do enjoy spicy food! They are quick and delicious seriously a must if you're in the neighborhood! How have I never written a review of this place? &#160;I just ate here after Hong Kong Bistro was unexpectedly closed. &#160;I always have their hot &#160;pot, which is solid. &#160;It might not have as an exotic selection of foods to dump in there versus other places, but it's been consistently great. &#160;Sometimes I wish service was a bit snappier, but it makes for a great leisurely meal. The green onion pancakes and the shaved noodles are amazing. Just amazing. I even got brave and ordered a seaweed and tofu soup that was surprisingly delicious! They give you tea and little nibbles of seasoned peanuts and spicy greens (cabbage?) while you wait. Loved every taste.The decor is a little like American Psycho meets Joe Versus the Volcano, but the service and food make it worth coming back to!Oh and we were the only ones not eating the "pot" meal, so we'll have to check that out next time. Nummy nummy. Across the street from one of my other favorite szechuan places in the ID (Sichuanese cuisine restaurant), Seven Stars is another great entry in this cuisine, particularly for hot pot. Can't really go wrong with either. The food here is outstanding! &#160;Inexpensive, too. &#160;It's a bit tricky to park underground (there is a place where you can and can't park), but you take the stairs and then elevator up to the second floor, and you're in a nice restaurant with a good view and friendly people and great service. &#160;Just talking about it makes me hungry...going there tonight, I think! I came back here the day after Thanksgiving and they said they don't have lunch special because it's holiday (that was Friday). That was like additional 4 dollars per order! ugh.The server this time is pretty annoying, we were not on the same page. Good food though. finally we gave in and tried one more stop there and they were open. It was alright although i have to say I like their hot pot dip. It is a thick peanut butter kinda sauce that you add chili oil to and ends up tasting very well together. We didn't do the all you could eat because it was just the two of us and we rather would have some extra seafood instead of all you can eat meat. I also like their dan dan noodles. they are spicy and made in the restaurant daily. Overall good service this time. FINALLY!!! The hotpot is awesome. &#160;Green onion pancake and spicy wonton make for good appetizers. &#160;Service is good and friendly. &#160;Don't waffle around about which kind of broth you want or they might bring the wrong kind. &#160;Really, if you get the non spicy broth, you shouldn't be eating hotpot to begin with. I've been here a multitude of times and after a recent trip for a birthday gathering, I realised that I hadn't reviewed them! &#160;Shame on me...If you like spice, you will not be disappointed here. &#160;Four stars IS four stars and the flavours are beautifully complex. &#160;We ordered a LOT of food for the birthday party, in essence an entr&#233;e a person. &#160;The food began to arrive, the table groaned under the weight of the food and we realised that we over-ordered! &#160;Each dish was enjoyed however... from the tame stir-fried long beans and ground pork to the spicy beef soup riddled with red pepper flakes like confetti! &#160;Try the hot pot if you have several people. &#160;It's a lot of fun and a nice way to spend one's meal time. &#160;The staff was very accommodating during the birthday gathering (and during other visits), keeping the cake and cupcakes safe for our dessert. &#160;And our waiter kept providing us with those lovely little saucers of spicy vegetables and checked on us often. &#160;They have their own parking lot which can be a bit tricksy to maneuver. &#160;The spots are snug and half of the lot closes by a certain time. &#160;Be mindful of the signs as best as possible. &#160;You can also find spots on the street provided it's not a game day, then avoid the ID altogether. &#160;There's an elevator that runs from the garage to the second floor. &#160;There are stairs also if you prefer. There are many styles of Dan Dan noodles. The meat isn't visible in the one here. But it is good enough. Lunch looks like a good deal. Everything costs around $6. The problem with a lot of reviewers is that they don't know what they're talking about with Chinese cuisine. China is a lot older and lot bigger than America - the natives have had centuries without mass transportation and the internet to develop their little cultural regions, including their food.Seven Stars is Szechuanese (spelling?), so don't come here looking for General Tso's Chicken or Sweet and Sour Pork or BBQ Humbow. If those things are on the menu, chances are they're not going to taste exactly how you'd like them to taste. Each region has a different taste and of course each chef cooks differently.That all being said, Seven Stars has some of the best and most authentic Chinese I've ever had in the Seattle, Portland, and Boston areas. (The only places that have it beat would be Vancouver and San Francisco.) &#160;First off, the Pot Stickers - Szechuan isn't exactly known for their pot stickers, but I make it a point to try them at pretty much every Chinese place I go - just to compare. ****THESE WERE THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD FROM A RESTAURANT.***** The filling was perfectly seasoned and had a good mix of ingredients. The dough was perfectly thin and chewy and crispy at all the right places. Heaven!!!We also had the famed Dan Dan Noodles, Mandarin Chicken, and Mapo Tofu. &#160;Everything was delicious and all of the ingredients tasted fresh and light. The hand-shaved noodles were delicious and full of flavor. The chicken was moist and deep fried just right. The tofu was spicy enough to practically take my head off, which is just as that dish should be! Everything was wonderful and we are it with gusto, knowing for the first time in a long time that the food we ate truly tasted like authentic Chinese restaurant fare and not street vendor-like or Panda Express-ish. We will definitely be dining here again, not to mention recommending it to everyone who possesses even a single tastebud.Next time: Twice-cooked pork (Szechuan cooking style speciality), the crab, green onion pancake, string beans, crispy fish. Can't wait! Ahhhh! Now that is what Sichuan food is SUPPOsed to be like. I cant live without the spicy sichuan mungbean jelly. &#160;My wife is (fairly recently) sichuanese and says this is as close as it gets to home. The hot pot is not only delicious, get the lamb for sure, but really fun for multiple people!Cant get really excited about the service, but consistantly not bad.Honestly , after nearly 3 years of regular eating Ive never had a bad meal. I admit it: &#160;I was so looking forward to checking this item off the Seattle Foodie 100 quest list that I only killed 24 people on the day leading up to my visit. &#160;I love me some hot pot.I'm not sure whether I left impressed or disappointed. &#160; Just getting to this place is something of an adventure, since it requires you to park in a tightly routed underground parking garage full of stereotype perpetuating female Asian drivers. &#160;Seriously, the Deathstar almost didn't survive the journey with all those people down there who don't get the concept that it's not a game of bumper cars, or that you can actually use the steering wheel to maneuver or the mirrors to look around. &#160;I should just get a couple of thousand of them and unleash them in Rebellion shipping lanes. &#160;The carnage they'd cause would absolutely dwarf what I could do in a star destroyer.But, finally, we did...only to be greeted by a puzzle of how to get to the top level of the complex to actually get into the restaurant. &#160;The decor inside was something of a contradiction unto itself. &#160;It was 1 part school lunchroom and 1 part hip post-modern lounge seating. &#160;The place was literally empty, yet somehow we drew the lunchroom card. &#160;Ordered the half-and-half hot pot from a server who obviously didn't speak much English. &#160;Part of the package in places like this, but still provides a challenge sometimes, since the only Mandarin words I can say are "Never underestimate the power of the Dark Side", "I'm Darth Vader, bitch!" and "I like big butts and I cannot lie". &#160;None of which would have gotten me very far with this guy. &#160;At least I hope.Few minutes later, out comes a single burner hotplate plopped in the middle of our table without a word. &#160;This is a new one to me. &#160;Shortly thereafter comes a bowl of mystery paste. &#160;Also not something I encountered in my previous hot pot dining experiences in China. &#160;Then comes the big bowl, also without a word. &#160;As this was Lady Vader's first foray to hot pot, she was completely lost. &#160;As I was used to being served it in a hot clay vessel complete with meats and veg, I was only slightly less lost. &#160;But hey, being versed in The Force means never being able to say you are somewhat confused, so I dutifully added the paste and wondered what the hell I was supposed to do next without any actual physical food. &#160;It took about 10 minutes for it to arrive and everything to make sense. &#160;The dish itself is absolutely delicious. &#160;It's not quite authentic (see above), but it's great in its own right. &#160; You know, once we actually got to eat it, since we were angrily scolded for overfilling the pot with food. &#160;As if we were supposed to know, given the unusual delivery method. &#160;The spicy half...they aren't kidding, that thing has some KICK. &#160;I wasn't expecting that. &#160;It was too spicy for Lady Vader's taste, and spicy enough to where I didn't feel inclined to add any heat to it. &#160;My mouth hasn't been that on fire since Obi Wan triple dog dared me to eat lava. &#160;You can never turn down a triple dog dare. &#160;The appetizer we ordered (some sort of spicy wonton) was not very good. &#160;There's plenty of food provided in the hot pot, so you're going to leave full. &#160;It was a bit pricey for what was provided. &#160;I wasn't expecting a meal for 2 at a half-dive restaurant to run 50 bucks. &#160;Service *highly* questionable - but again, that's to be expected when you dine in an area where even the signage is in another language. &#160;All in all, this place was a real mixed bag. &#160;The food was excellent, but everything else was a bit of a bummer. &#160;I'm gonna split the pipe, and give this place 3 Deathstars. I was super excited to come here (my co-worker and I even skived off work one day when everyone was on vacation and drove all the way from the Eastside just for lunch) but my experience was sadly underwhelming. The place was nearly empty, with only one other table there and another party that came in after we were seated. The service was perfunctory. I didn't really care because I was so psyched for the food, having read all the rave reviews... but then the food let me down.We had the hand shaven noodles and the fried fish with string beans. Both dishes were bland - not at all spicy like the name and reputation suggested. The gravy on the noodles was fairly tasty and the breading on the fish was crispy and air-light, but overall flavor was lacking - as were the green beans (there were like, three on the plate). I had to douse my food in hot chili oil just to feel anything. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, or maybe they were having an off day. I'll give them another chance, but my initial experience was rather meh. I didn't try the hot pot.But it was lunchtime and we didn't want to order the hot pot.We ordered cashew chicken and some tofu noodle-y dish thing instead.$5.95 per meal! &#160;WHAT! &#160;That's unheard of anymore unless you visit the taco trucks!While we enjoyed our meals, they weren't mind blowing or anything to write home about. &#160;They were exactly what we were looking for: &#160;good, solid, Asian lunchtime-y foods.Thank you Seven Stars...I'll be back. &#160;PREPARE YOUR HOT POT. I don't know if I've ever had a bad experience at Seven Stars Pepper. Ok, maybe once it was less stellar than it normally is, but it was still pretty good. Situated on the second floor of a strip mall in the ID, Seven Stars Pepper is a Chinese restaurant that specializes in Szechuan cuisine. You know, spicy dishes. &#160;The extensive menu has recognizable if not all that authentic dishes (Mongolian Beef, etc.) as well as more exotic entrees, if you know what you're doing. It's a testament to the consistent quality of this place that I have no qualms ordering something about which I have no idea because I trust it'll be delicious when arrives. One thing I learned early on is that if given the option, always choose the handshaven noodles and always, ALWAYS ask for a 'watermelon drink', which is essentially just blended up watermelon. It's the perfect counter for the spiciness of dinner. They also offer hot pot but I've never gotten it here. I'm sure it's awesome.The service is good, the portions are large and the prices are reasonable. In fact, come here for lunch and you can have an awesome meal (and probably take some home with you) for around six bucks. I met this really nice couple out at the Waterwheel lounge in Ballard around six months ago and we started trading stories about great places to eat and this was one of their high recommendations... &#160;why it took me six months to get here I don't know, but I'm glad I went! &#160;First off, the location is little tricky to figure out at first, when we got there it looked as though it was closed, all we saw was an empty storefront, but we then realized it was up on the 2nd story (the space below it was empty). Next was trying to figure out how to get up there.. &#160;this place must have really good food because only those that know the secret entry and password can get in! &#160;..there were no visible stairs or anything from where we were standing, but we finally found an elevator (and later even found actual stairs!). &#160;According to http://cidbia.org this area isn't actually listed as part of the "official" Chinatown/International District, even though it has a lot of the real deal Chinese/Asian ethnic groceries, shops and restaurants (this might actually be the real "Chinatown"). &#160;;-)So, on to the food: We came with a short list of things to try based on my friend's recommendations, as well as from looking at some of the Yelp reviews:1. Appetizer - Sliced Beef/ Omasa In Hot Oil: How have I never had this before, it was delicious! Cold slices of beef in a spicy sauce with sesame seeds and cilantro. I have no idea what part of the cow this is, but the waiter felt compelled to say it was "muscle", though my understanding is that all of the red stuff we usually call "meat" is a muscle, it's the other parts we give different names to and Google didn't help any as the only close word was 'omasum', which is one of the stomachs, this didn't look like it was stomach.. to quote Monk, "I could be wrong but I don't think so".2. Egg Drop soup: Delicious, but not orgasmic, though admittedly I don't know that Egg Drop soup is supposed to be orgasmic, or if it &#160;can even achieve orgasmic properties, however, if you do know of an egg drop soup that meets this criteria please enlighten us all! ;-)3. Dan Dan (hand shaved noodles) in a peanut sauce with chicken: This was really good, the noodles were great, and although the sauce was delicious I wasn't totally in the mood for a peanut based sauce. According to Wikipedia (insert possible grain of salt comment here), and the one 'Dan Dan' picture posted on Wikipedia, the version we had might have been a little "americanized?, but then again what is considered authentic or "traditional" probably depends more on who's mom cooked it for you when you were growing up (in China), and what part of China you were from! ;-) &#160;Nonetheless I'm intrigued by what was posted on Wikipedia 9and eager to hear from others who have first hand knowledge from back home: From Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;: "Dandan noodles are a classic dish of Chinese Sichuan cuisine. It consists of a spicy sauce containing preserved vegetables (often including zha cai, , lower enlarged mustard stem, or ya cai, , upper mustard stems), chili oil, Sichuan pepper, minced pork, and scallions served over noodles.Sesame paste is sometimes added.[1] This is particularly true in American Chinese cuisine where it is even sometimes substituted with peanut butter. In American Chinese cuisine, Dan Dan Mian is often sweeter, less spicy, and less soupy.*We definitely had the peanut butter version. I want to try the version shown in the picture on Wikipedia, without peanut butter, I bet I could ask them to make that style next time!4. Steamed pork dumplings: Very good, though I think I'm getting really spoiled by the thinner skins of the Xiaolongbao - Shanghai Soup dumplings, but delicious nonetheless.5. Broccoli in garlic sauce: How can you do broccoli in garlic sauce wrong? &#160; *See my review of Bamboo Village in Wallingford, that was some seriously mushy broccoli.I'm looking forward to heading back to Seven Stars to try their Hot Pots and some of the other menu items, it looks like it could take quite a few visits to come close to exhausting all they have to offer. Great hot pot, good service. I found a part of a finger on the way to this joint the other day. &#160;Okay, it wasn't a finger, it was part of a hot dog, but still it was disconcerting. &#160;Why am I saying all this when I gave this place 5 stars? Because, that's how good it is. &#160;I would be willing to take the risk of losing a minor body part to eat here.The Szechuan Dan Dan Noodles alone make this place worth the trip. &#160;These hand-shaven noodles in peanut sauce with pork is a must have for me whenever I go. &#160;Their flavor-packed chicken in hot garlic sauce is also something to behold. &#160;I haven't tried their hot pot dishes but it's something I plan on partaking in on one of my trips.Now I wouldn't give up a kidney or my liver, but like the risk of losing a toe or maybe an earlobe wouldn't keep me away from Seven Stars. My boyfriend and I were introduced to this place by another couple. &#160;We came here on a rainy Saturday afternoon and had a serious feast! &#160;We ordered 5 things to share between the four of us. &#160;All of the food was fantastic! &#160;I have had cravings for the spicy garlic eggplant several times since eating it here.Service was good. &#160;And everyone was friendly. &#160;I can't wait to go back! Been here several times for dinner. &#160;Reliably good, greasy, and spicy, true to Szechuan cuisine.I really like hand shaven noodles, and the ones here are pretty good. The green onion pancake, dan dan noodles, spicy wontons, baby bok choy sauteed in garlic, and fried chicken have all been good. (About the chicken, we actually &#160;ordered fried fish. Luckily, we have no dietary restrictions. The staff were polite about the mistake. We.received multiple apologies from different staff and an offer to remake the dish, but we kept the chicken cause it was goood.) Seven Stars has been busy every time I have been here for dinner, whether early or late. Nonetheless, food is served surprisingly quickly. Definitely recommend this place for Szechuan lovers. I like it much better than Spiced in Bellevue.No website, but menu can be found on websites such as allmenus and menuism. Unfortunately for my fellow Chinese readers, the websites have English menus. Also, if I recall correctly, the in-store menus have more options than the online ones.
Impeccably great food. I'm pretty sure I'm somewhere around 100 visits for lunch. Every dish is always prepared slightly different (fresh) but inspired every time. &#160;If you don't consider the whole lunch menu to be a no-lose selection, which it is, &#160;then go for the dinner fish in black bean sauce. &#160;I feel like I've stolen from them each time because of the insanely low price for the quality. 2 star price for 5 star food. awesome! i loved everything that i had here but i have to say, the broccoli in smokyey sauce was amazing. great location for people watching also (which i love). don't miss out on the spicey szechuan style dumplings, oh my god they were so good. the parking situation is a little bit funny, i watched a few near misses on the one lane enterance and exit to the underground parking garage during my meal, and then experianced one myself on our way out, but it's not enough to keep me from coming back, thats for sure! the plus: &#160;tasty house special pancake. &#160;ants on a tree--delicious for us aardvarks. &#160;lamb and tofu--very good, but see below. &#160;lastly, the service was fast and friendlyminuses: &#160;what happened to using any szechuan pepper? &#160;it was absent from everything. &#160;the kung pao sucked. &#160;everything was a little lackluster. &#160;this is the first time we've been back in over 2 years, since we were turned on to szechuan chef. &#160;i think the flavors here have faded, and are less deep than the chef's. &#160;still, pretty good overall. One of the better Chinese restaurants I have been to in Seattle. &#160;You get a ton for good food for your money. &#160;Everything's flavorful and very filling. &#160;Our table of 5 ordered way too much food and unfortunately I don't know what the dishes called. &#160;You have to try the cold szechuan noodles, dumplings, fish and hand shaved noodles. I'll definitely be ordering food to go from here and trying the hot pot next time.If you drive, make sure you don't park in the grocery parking lot underneath the building. &#160;A section of the lot closes at 8pm and they lock the gate at that time. &#160;Let's just say, trying to get your car out of a locked parking garage is not the a good way to spend the evening after a delicious dinner. I had hot pot here for the first time with a group from work a couple weeks ago. Getting up there is an interesting experience, you have to go to the stairs in the back and find your way up.We got the all you can eat hot pot and they gave us two different broths (one spicy and one not). We all preferred the spicy one after trying both. It comes with potato, bamboo shoots, different types of noodles, cabbage, tofu, and various thin cut meats (not even sure what they all were). We had fun cooking everything together and attempting to figure out how we were supposed to be doing it in the first place.All in all, the hot pot was more of a novelty for me. That spicy stuff also made my usually bionic stomach pretty pissed later that night.Other people that got regular plates were not very excited about them.For a laugh to work off your meal, walk to the corner of 12th and Jefferson and look at the posters in the window of the store there... If you are into green onion pancakes, like I am, you might want to know that Seven Star's pancakes are real light on flavor. &#160;Still, the dipping sauce was very good. &#160;Compare Seven Star's pancakes to Bellevue's Szechaun Chef's green onion pancake and taste the difference!The Mongolian beef is decent but not noteworthy. Except I just did note it, didn't I?The elevator you take up to the restaurant is creepy. &#160;It is dirty. &#160;And inexplicably, it has a torn pin-up picture of a lady named Bao Lin taped to the inside of the light fixture.If I seem grouchy, maybe it's because I got a letter from the IRS today that didn't exactly thrill me. If only I could give seven stars to Seven Stars Pepper. . . I recently visited SSPR for the first time with a new group of friends. Before I even had a chance to look at a menu, the leader of the pack proclaimed to the waitress, "Hot Pot for everyone." With those simple words, an unbelievable and unending procession of perfectly pink piles of pork, marbled mounds of meat, cornucopias of cool cabbage, a table full of tasty tofu, oodles of noodles, pints of peanut sauce, bunches of bamboo shoots, and piles of potatoes began. The procession marched into a lovely pot of boiling broth (one side spicy the other not). [Note: The use of the term unending is not an exaggeration. Their hot pot is served as all you care to eat. Additionally, did you know the nice folks at the Beef Board created a list of beef adjectives? Check it out: http://www.beefandvealcu&#8230; What marched out the other side of the pot was a delightful 2 1/2 hour meal, leisurely in its pace and singular in its focus -- decimating hunger while warming body and soul. You might think that it would cost a small fortune to participate in such a spectacle, but you would be incorrect. All this can be had for the low price of $17.00 per person (including tax and tip). Now, go forth and hot pot! Hot Pot is a Hot Hit! Seven Peppers was an unknown secret for a year or two and once word got out this place has found itself a loyal following. The restaurant is now on it' second owner and the food has not changed much. They must have sold the cooks along with the restaurant. Many things are tasty here at Seven Peppers, but if you like to have a fun more hands on experience of eating, take a shot at the all you can eat hot pot for two or more guest. You will not be disappointed at the fresh food and lean meats brought out for you to cook. I normally split the hot pot into two soup styles, super hot and regular, this way you have an opportunity to vary your dining experience. First dump your vegetables into the Pot to help Marinate the broth, then your tofu, Noodles in your provided cooking nets, then your meat, a bit of the bean sauce and you are good to go. For an appetizer, try the green onion pancakes to start. Bring a couple of friends and enjoy the food, you shouldn't be disappointed. When I first walked in the bubbling cauldron "Hot Pots" on the tables nearby called to me.. I mean come on, to have your own lil gas stove 'fire' on your table is pretty hard to resist.But, I chickened out at the last minute as some other dishes called to me.The meal:- They offer free hot tea and a nice lil cold pickled veggie &amp; cabbage appetizer which was a nice touch.- The green onion pancake. Best appetizer ever! Order this.- Spicy crispy pork served with rice. Very tasty, I'd say best in Seattle.- Ant on a tree- great noodles, also w/ just the right spice!We loved our food and had a ton of leftovers! I had it for lunch two more times! I will need to go back for the Hot Pot experience someday.Tip: Bike or bus. If you must drive, Park on the road not in the lot or garage, it has odd hours and is crazy busy anyways, a sure way for a door ding. Still the best hotpot in town. I've been to Seven Stars Pepper Restaurant... four times now, I think... and man oh man, I've been a happy, verrry full person every time (no matter how hungry I am). My favorite thing is probably one of the most odd items on the menu, but I find it irresistible... it's got octopus and prawn in a "wild pepper sauce" which has some lotus roots (I think) or bamboo shoots in a white sauce with awesome little peppers, some purple... the seafood is so yummy in this. I've also had ant on a tree, which has some shaved noodles and pork and is pretty yummy (I love the noodles, not so crazy about the pork, but pork I'm quite finicky about)... The green onion pancakes are pretty tasty... their sauce is awesome (I'm pretty sure it has an *aged* soy sauce base, since I use aged soy at home all the time)... the pancakes have varied between not bad and awesome, usually somewhere around the "I'll do that again someday" level...There's a gen...something... chicken dish that has fried breaded chicken and green beans... it's spicy, yup, but it's missing something, I think, since dipping it into a little hoisin helped... some layering of flavor would do that dish well...Hot pots there are an interesting experiment that I want to do more often... and plan to... the only time I shared someone else's, I liked what I had until they added something (didn't see what) that made it taste too salty for me. Still, I could tell the quality was superior to most places.The most recent visit was this past CNYE, the 25th of January, 09... and I got a special that was just for the holiday: "sweet duck." Oh man... man oh man... the tender duck, in all its massive massive size... was so wonderfully basted that I wanted more, more, more of the glaze... I had to settle for a little hoisin (cause the parts that were far from the glazed skin were inferior to the parts near the skin)... but wow... they do know how to celebrate... makes me wish I had gotten the spicy crab rice cakes instead of the green onion pancakes. The complimentary tea is wonderful, too, and somehow ... sweet... I wonder if it has a bit of jasmine flower petals or rice in it to make it so sweet without sugar... but in any case, I went through the entire pot all by myself, which means... it's some good tea overall. The little appetizer of cold spicy pickled cabbage and carrots is also yummy and whets the appetite perfectly. This place has me won over... admittedly, the weird weird first dish that I had (which I've repeatedly ordered) with the wild pepper sauce really did surprise me and make me yearn for it... but there's a whole lot on their menu I'm still itching to try, and that... is a good sign. The fact that it takes me a substantial amount of time to decide between yummy sounding thing number one and yummy sounding thing number 3 or 12 or 16 is a great indication of my likelihood of going back (so long as the bus goes there, I go there!)Anyone wanting authentic Chinese in hearty portions with wonderful service will find this warm second floor restaurant welcoming and very likely soothing to a hungry soul (an elevator goes right to its door from below, and there's parking underneath the building, though the entry is a little hidden between rows of cars in the lot). They're also very kind to seat people at window tables first so light and the views of the area are part of the experience. The tables and chairs are also clean and comfy, and it's been very sanitary every time I've gone there. They are also very family-friendly, and I have seen a pleasant increase in curious young kids there with their families. I enjoyed a wonderful lunch at 7 Stars Pepper with a friend a year ago, which included the beef shaved noodles, green onion pancake, and spicy tofu. &#160;It motivated me to try recommended hot pot on a next visit. &#160;I ordered the seafood hot pot on my last visit, and I was extremely disappointed. &#160;5 prawns, some calamari (rubbery - I know I know - it usually is), several fish balls. &#160;I guess the fishballs were the big seafood item, which disappointed me even more. &#160;How about some more prawns and a better selection than a shaving of white fish? &#160;And when was a seafood hot pot's focus supposed to be a big portion of frozen beef? &#160;I didn't order the somewhat seafood/lots of beef hot pot. &#160;Not good. &#160;No seasoning in the broth (just some chilli oil one the spicy side of the hot pot container.) &#160;We walked away very disappointed. &#160;Stick to the lunch deals. &#160;Skip the hot pot.
Although I am completely bias since I live in "The OC" and the heart of "Little Siagon" where there is a pho cafe is literally on every street corner. &#160;Therefore, I guess standards are a little higher.As far as pho goes...Pho Ha is less than average. &#160;Although the broth is decent, the quality of everything else completely falls short of authentic. &#160;The quality of the meats were pathetic, the brisket was cut way too thick and the beef slices completely fell apart in the bowl. &#160;We ordered steak beef on the side in the raw so we can add it ourselves and they basically put two slices on a plate. &#160;Not to mentioned that the noodles were completely overcooked.I had ordered the shrimp spring roll, which looked like one long poor attempt a &#160;some sort of a roll, but far from a spring roll. &#160;We also ordered egg rolls...it looked like something frozen pre-made rolls that tasted like card board. &#160;Moreover, I ordered basic raw onions in vinegar, this is part of pho basic and is pretty much like ordering a condiment. &#160;Saddly, I had to give them instruction of what to do.Yes my pho snobbery is coming through loud and clear, but there are really good Pho in Seattle; Pho Cyclo is pretty good and very traditional. Convenient (work wise), cheap, and not bad as far as Pho in Pioneer Square is concerned. &#160;I still tout Than Brothers as the best, but I can't get there during work hours, so I hit Pho Ha instead. &#160;I like it. &#160;It's pretty good when I'm craving it. &#160;And the location works for me.There you go. &#160;The most boring review I've done yet. I was summons to jury duty which meant lunch in a new part of downtown. &#160;The first day during orientation we were told we'd be getting about an hour and a half for our lunch break. &#160;All kinds of thoughts went into my head of where I could go. &#160;All morning I was thinking of places to try in the ID, my mouth was beginning to water. &#160;I get called for a panel, I get sent upstairs to a court room with 40 other people. &#160;I sit and hear hardship cases people are using to get out of jail, I mean jury duty. &#160;I'm watching the clock...it's 12:15 pm the judge finally releases us and tells us we have to be back in the jury room by 1:00 pm, um what?!?! &#160;Where's the hour and a half lunch I was promised earlier?!?! &#160;Anyways I make due, I finally get out of the building and head down James to Yesler, thinking Mitchelli's for lunch would work than I passed Pho &amp; Bubble Tea and went in there instead.I thought Pho might be what I wanted but when the waitress lady came to take my order my &#160;mouth spoke one BBQ pork Banh Mi NO CUCUMBERS and one fried roll. &#160;I receive my Banh Mi and it appears to have extra cucumbers, not a good thing, the fired roll arrived and it was black with spots of brown. &#160;So far not good. &#160;I picked the cucumbers out and took a bite, yuck, the bread was too big for the Banh Mi and the BBQ pork was meh. I found a not so black part on the fried roll and took a bite, it was all grease, I ended up tearing it apart and ate some of the filling inside, that was good the black 'wrapper' wasn't. &#160;I don't think I'll come back to try the Pho I'm a little to scared at what I might get. Value. &#160;Friendly folks. &#160;Unfortunately, they were out of bun noodles (what?!?), and the Pho noodles were the most al dente versions I have ever had. &#160;Broth: &#160;OK. &#160;Meat: &#160;OK.There is better in town, but if you were sick at work and needed a bowl, OR you were psychoglycemic and mangry...this would be just the thing.Also: &#160;they close at 8pm. This place does pho the way I like it... cheap and full of scary bits. It's the only place within close walking distance that has tripe, tendon and rare beef in the combo. If they'd throw in meatballs, I'd throw in a star, but since they don't...Oh, and I will say that I've never found the place dirty, so maybe that is an improvement. Maybe they read yelp. If they do, add meatballs to the number 15! And quit skimping on the tripe! Oh yes, my lovely lunch spot.My coworkers call this place "Dirty Pho" because it's not exactly spic and span clean. But their veggie pho is AWESOME-o. seriously. It's got loads of thick cubed tofu, which soaks up the yummy taste of the broth. The plum sauce is great in the soup, and the veggies are plentiful. It seems like a healthy alternative to, really, anything else I would eat.The girls that work there know what I order and put my order in as soon as I walk in the door (I was going there about twice a week, if not more, for a few months). It's not cheap- about $7.45 for a large (plus tip!) and about $7 for a regular. But it's worth it.A couple of things that kind of weird me out is the fact that it doesn't seem all that clean, and also, although they are semi-sweethearts, the waitresses yell at each other throughout the restaurant in Cantonese or whatever language they speak (forgive my ignorance). It's almost like watching a TV show... built in entertainment! The short, stockier girl bosses everyone else around and yells at them.My favorite part is when I order To Go, and the lady cook comes out with my order and says, "You're so pretty!" and then scurries back into the kitchen. It's cute, and who doesn't love a little flattery? I've never set foot in this place... perhaps the vibe would win me over?Based SOLEY on the bahn mi that a co-worker brought me from here this place is BLAND. Dry bread, no jalapenos and very little sauce... PLUS it is more expensive bahn mi than most places. I will not be back... unless someone else pays. I've been here a few times, and yes i would go back. &#160;But most of the time i &#160;take the extra walk (about 10 minutes) to get up to Pho Bac. &#160;The Pho here is fine, the bubble tea is fine, and nothing is wrong with the atmosphere. &#160;But after eating pho all over this city, this one doesn't make my short list. &#160;If you're in the area, stop in and check it out. &#160;I wouldn't go out of your way to get to it though. The hot and sour veggie pho is packed with celery, carrots, mushrooms (both button and shiitake), onion (both white and green), pineapple, tofu and noodles. And a tomato wedge. Oh, and possibly some broth flowing around the objects in my bowl.Pho is a gift from Vietnam and God: eating a bowl screams "THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELS YOU!" at lurking cold &amp; flu demons. After lunch, my throat was soothed and my coughing subdued. Glory Be!Too bad I've spent the remainder of the day running into the bathroom. What manner of evil are they cooking with over there? I always get veggie pho to go. They use tofu, mushrooms, celery and carrots. Than Brothers only uses tofu and mushrooms. I am pretty sure that ordering veggie pho in the first place is not very 'authentic' but I'm always down for more vegetables. This place looks like an old building that was repainted to look 'like new'. &#160;The main reason we came here is because it was raining outside and we (my bf and I) felt like eating something warm and soothing. &#160;The pho bowls were smaller than what I'm use to and it was average priced for pho (approx. $6 small, $8 large). &#160;The service was good and that might be because we were the only people eating there. &#160;It was just another bowl of pho, nothing special. &#160;Although we can get pho anytime we went here because of the weather.
I went here on a spur-of-the-moment trip with a person who was knowledgeable about Seattle's Ethiopian cuisine. She says it's one of the best, most authentic places to eat Ethiopian food in Seattle. She says that it gets really fun around 11 on Friday nights. We went in the early evening on a Wednesday. It's a hole-in-the-wall place with drab decor. We ordered the combination plate and shared. I liked mixing the red and green stuff together as well as the lamb. It was a ton of food, and we had quite a bit leftover between us. It was my first Ethiopian cuisine experience, so I have a hard time comparing it to anything substantive. The food was good and plentiful, the prices cheap, and the service reasonable given where you are and what you're eating.
Oh Lottie... you are sooo cute! I love your homey cozy feel... you feel more like a good ole' friend than a lounge.I love that the tables are scattered near one another and in the back is a nice nook with set up like a living area with two chairs and a couch. &#160;A nice seating area outside at the front of the lounge on the main street is a nice touch too.Full bar is nice so its not limited to just beer and wine =D &#160;My friend and I came here for drinks, but we peeked at the food menu and it offers a nice selection of nibbles that I would definitely try. &#160;They even have grilled cheese which is my favourite homey feel food dish!!! &#160;And for you breakfast lovers, they do offer breakfast which is good to know because it gives me another option in my hood!Overall, a great place to kick back and enjoy company. &#160;One drawback for me this visit was the inattentive service. &#160;However, it was a friday night and around 7-9pm so it was pretty busy. &#160;Other than that it was a good solid experience! Oh Lottie's. How I really do love you guys. Your yummy soups. Your cozy, homey seating. I read in Seattle Weekly that you were voted Best New Neighborhood bar last year.But your service... ugh. Every time one of my friends mentions going to Lottie's, I immediately gasp with excitement. Only to recoil, as I remember how horribly slow your service is. Even when it's not busy, it should never ever take 15 minutes for 2 drinks to be delivered. And then there's the process of getting and paying the bill. Holy ish. No joke. It's a process.Lotties, I want you guys to be awesome because actually, you really are awesome but could you actually BE awesome? I want to want to go back, not dread to go. My friend took me here while I was up visiting Seattle for the weekend for some late night drinks. The drinks are awesome. And strong. Very strong. I'm very disappointed that I was too hungover the next morning to come in for Sunday brunch. Next time it's a must since it's right by Friend's house. Rating is for brunch. More specifically for one essential brunch menu item. Chilaquil&#233;s. is. amazing. &#160; I'll try to get a picture here someday, but for now picture mexcellent lasagna! This small neighborhood lounge in the revived historic South Seattle neighborhood of Columbia City is awesome. They serve up great food and stiff drinks here. I like going here for happy hour for a beer and to meet the locals.This place has a small outdoor seating area which is great for soaking in the sun (during the Summer) while watching people get mugged at the Bank of America ATM down the street. Haha, just kidding. That would've been the Columbia City of the past. Friendly people go here and there are great local businesses in this fun and eclectic community. I obviously need to make it out to Columbia City more. Last time I was here was a ~year~ ago, and drinks were really the only thing on the menu that night. Fast forward 12 months and while drinks were still on the menu, we all wanted some food to go with our pitchers of beer. Being me, which is either naively optimistic or just a plain sucker -- I opted for the french dip. Yes; most places disappoint me, but I always hold out for the rare occasion that they actually make me happy. And guess what? Lottie's did NOT disappoint. Crispy on the outside bread, hot roast beef and awesomely melty cheese accompanied with a rather tasty mushroom ju. While not as robust as I normally like, the ju was flavorful and leaps and bounds above the watery brown meat juice you get at a lot of other establishments. The bacon mac &amp; cheese was also ordered, and I stole several bites of this as well. It came out in a weird wedge with a literal strip of bacon on top -- but it was super cheesy and delicious!Tap list is ok, nothing great but nothing horrible either. That was probably more my timing and my beer snobbiness coming through though. The art on the walls is good, the atmosphere comfortably cramped and loud with locals, and the service sassy and friendly. I remember being gently teased by the bartender last year, and on my most recent outing the waitress was friendly and on the ball. Manage to time it right and you can have the table in the back corner with comfy couches and a living-room type feel to your night. I thoroughly enjoyed it. &#160;Good sandwiches, good drinks, good company, good place. I really wanted to like them but unfortunately the service is terrible and the food is eh. &#160;It was super crowded in there too...and I am not really sure why. &#160;Plenty of servers too so the wait shouldn't have been that bad... The new owner brought in draft beer! i love this place. the staff make me feel like one of the cool kids and i alway see a friend or two. the food is bar food and it does it's job well. the soup is always great and the sandwiches kick ass and take names.during the day it's all ages and my kid loves it there! the make him fell like a king! they have been great at throwing something together for him to eat, like noodles with butter, or some fruit as a snack. the beverages are fantastic where you are a drinker or just one or no booze at all... just great!love you guys, keep it up! this is the closest bar to my apartment, so it gets two stars for that. &#160;the drink selection is small (three beers on tap), but that's not a bad thing! &#160;hyperchoice is bad! the food is good, but a bit pricey. &#160;the service is also pretty good. &#160;everyone that works here seems to be having a good night when they are at work, which makes this place really comfortable to have a drink with friends or to get hammered and play cards at the couches. &#160;so, that's the third star.the fourth star is for finally taking that tacky shit off the walls (fake protest signs with stupid generic slogans on them). Great neighborhood bar! &#160;Love coming here casually for drinks and the food is good too! I love having a neighborhood bar, and this is a great one. The service is usually good and the food is always very tasty. My favorite thing to eat here is the french toast during weekend brunch, I think they make it with magic or something because I can't get mine to be as tasty. The new bar is fantastic! The waitresses are soooo cute! AND when I left my phone there, the bartender totally helped me and got it back to me...what more can you ask for? The food is super cool, the vegan option for all of their sandwiches is GREAT!
For their seafood congee: five stars doesn't cover it, man.i got some to-go after bringing my Mum some lunch across the street at Hamilton today around noon. I didn't remember much about the congee i had that one time last year when I'd come with my dad, but decided to treat myself.They are so generous with their seafood in the seafood congee. Mussels, shrimp, squid, fish, and...scallops?? I think i just ate one! I added century egg for a buck, and it's not a skimpy portion...little black chunks everywhere (i'm eating it right now!). And it's a different style than the Chinese i've been getting in the ID: it's thicker, with chunkier rice, and really has a nice, delicate sweetness. Lately i've been getting watery stuff from the I.D. so this was such a nice change.I also ordered the thousand-layer-pancake, which was like a flaky, oniony, warm pastry. I payed $3.95 for it and ate it on the way home because i couldn't stop myself. It was doughy and chewy in some parts, flaky and crispy in others. WARNING: you will get little flakes all over your lap and car!*sigh* i am falling in love with congee all over again.*joy Oh my gawd, I went here everyday in high school and it was delicious. Very authentic and I loved the staff (helped that all my friends were Taiwanese). I keep meaning to come back to bring my husband so he can get a mouthful of Taiwanese goodness. Yummy, AUTHENTIC Chinese food. &#160;Yes, it's a hole in the wall kind of place, but if the food is good, the place is clean, you really don't need to pay extra for the decor. &#160;Prices are much better than Facing East in Bellevue but I would say the food is just as good, if not better. &#160;(That's where you bring someone new to the cuisine or who would be squeamish about hole in the walls.)We had the stinky tofu, Taiwanese meatball (which is more like chopped meat and mushrooms in a glutenous shell), beef noodle soup, and leek pancake (that we could have done without). &#160;Otherwise everything else was solid. &#160;Besides us, there were also few other tables of Chinese-speaking patrons - always a good sign!Can't wait to go back to try more! Facing East in Bellevue is one of my favorite Chinese/Taiwanese joints to eat at. However, they're ridiculously busy (too busy for their own good) and they're closed on Mondays.If you're burned out by the incredible crowding of Facing East, may I suggest that you try out Rocking Wok? The menu and the food quality are very similar. The pai guo fan (pork over rice with vegetables) and beef noodle soup are impeccable, and both dishes are under $7. My wife and I got out of here for just over $15 with tip and tax. That's unheard of for such a good, filling dinner.Drawbacks? There are few. Service can be a bit leisurely even when the restaurant is less than 25% full. The interior's a bit dingy (but not unclean/gross). Street parking only, which can be a little ridiculous in Wallingford (where each house seems to have cars that all park on the street).But these aren't enough to detract from an awesome little neighborhood restaurant in white-bread (well, granola) Wallingford. Four stars. The first time I tried to try Rocking Wok was a Tuesday after I first moved to Seattle. &#160;I distinctly remember because that is the day that Rocking Wok is closed. &#160;Yes, closed Tuesdays!! Imagine how upset I was. Well I went back again and it was very good. &#160;I think they have the most consistent Beef Noodle Soup with Shaved Noodles I have tried and they have really great Taiwanese dishes. &#160;I have no idea what the gravy is that they use in their Squid Pottage with gravy or their Seafood with gravy, but it is pretty delicious! &#160;The popcorn chicken is also worth a try.Service is pretty timely. &#160;I will warn you that the booths and chairs are a bit old and can be sticky, but it's a Chinese restaurant, so I'm sure you expected that. &#160;3 of us went for dinner once and got about 6 dishes and the total came out to 40-50 dollars (without tip). This restaurant is located in a quaint setting in the middle of a neighborhood. It is small with a couple of large round tables in the front for large groups and some booths in the back for smaller groups. They have at least one high chair. The Good: the food is great! Their pancakes are worth the trip alone. They are buttery and flaky. Comfort food at its best. The honey beef was crispy and my husband was a huge fan - while I wasn't a fan of the crust. We had their crispy noodles which had a thick flavorful white sauce with chicken, pork and shrimp. The last thing we had were their pot stickers which were fine. The Bad: The smell. If you are at all bothered by the smell of kim chi, stay away. To me it smells like a mix of moth balls and a poopy diaper. I kept checking my toddler to make sure she wasn't the source of the odor. It turned out to be the tables on either side of us which had ordered it. The aroma hangs in the air and hits you as soon as you walk in. You will stop noticing it the longer you sit there and the food is worth it. I rarely trust the reviews of Taiwanese/Chinese food on Yelp. &#160;It seems people order one dish not suited to the American palate and give the restaurant a bad review.Rocking Wok is a surprisingly authentic Taiwanese comfort food restaurant located in a residential part of Wallingford. &#160;We haven been going there for years and almost always order the same thing: honey dew beef, wontons in chili sauce, hot and sour soup, green beans, and thousand layer pancake. &#160;I know, we need to branch out--but try those and it might be hard to order something else!Last time I went with a Taiwanese friend of mine she just couldn't believe that such an authentic Taiwanese joint was located in Wallingford! This place is legit. It really felt like I was in Asia somewhere - which mainly could have been from the Taiwanese "American Idol" - esque show that was on in the background. &#160;I had see this place before because my dentist is down the street - but we ended up here because of a random phone search for Chinese food.Pretty good, I'd say - from my unschooled white girl perspective. &#160;Nothing for atmosphere or cleanliness, but the food was really good. &#160;We started with slippery pork dumplings which were probably the best part of the meal. &#160;Followed by orange chicken, and mixed veggies - and 'sticky rice'. &#160;Which was definitely not the sticky rice I am used to. &#160;What I could tell was it1) was brown2) had chestnuts (yum!) and peanuts3) had some unrecognizable brown meat-like stuff, which may or may not be the stinky tofu I heard about.I was glad I tried it. I may not have it again.I loved the mixed veggies were FRESH with capped mushrooms, bok choy, string beans, water chestnuts ....awesome.I definitely recommend this for an authentic culinary and culteral experience. Let's get to the star attraction first: &#160; Anyone who has tried to look for Shanghai soup dumplings in Seattle has known the heartbreak. &#160; Well, the drought is over. &#160; I'm unclear if there is a difference between Shanghai style and Taiwan style but we're talking really yummy soup dumplings full of flavor and broth. &#160;I might quibble and point out that you have to ask for spoons and I'm assuming that the idea is that you pick them up with your chopsticks, dip them into the vinegar/ginger dip and eat them whole. &#160;I asked for a spoon but ended up eating it whole anyway. &#160; Thing is, if you're a klutz you could break the skin and loose the soup. &#160;This would be a tragedy of immense proportions so ask for a spoon. &#160; The spouse was more dainty so I don't think they've thought this one all the way through.... but who cares.... it's the real deal and I'll get them into my mouth one way or the other.Great hand-cut noodles with seafood. &#160; Perfectly done green beans. &#160;Chicken with garlic sauce was spicier than expected but a great portion of chicken with a slightly vinegar-based hot pepper sauce.I can't wait to get back there and try the seafood congee. &#160; Nice people, great prices. &#160; This is a must-go place for Chinese foodies.Peter The Rocking Wok is a delectable destination. I love their menu. It's &#160;where I go to rondevous with a great plate of Taiwanese food.They make the best wonton / pork dumpling soup, chocked full of garlic and love. It's beyond good! I love their delightful spicy green beans. Check out the appetizers, try the cold jelly fish, the pickled baby bamboo shoots, 1000 layer scallion pancake or stinky tofu. Be adventurous, step outside the box. try the salt and pepper squid, the salt and pepper pork chop or the smoked tea duck. I love the honey dew beef. This place is a dive! It sits on a residentual street in the middle of Wallingford. Decor? What decor! You cant eat the decor! But the Rocking Wok serves outstanding food. JR
Three of us hit Duke's at my friend's request. It was her birthday, and she loves the steamers and blueberry lemon drop on the happy hour menu. There is a small parking lot behind Duke's, and street parking around the building if you can find it on a sunny summer day. Upon entering we were looking forward to soaking up some Vitamin D on the patio, but were told happy hour fare and prices required us to sit inside. I tried to sweet-talk our server, explaining it was our friend's birthday, and was there any chance we could move outside (especially since it was a Monday, there were many free tables, and there was 1/2 hour or less remaining of happy hour). No dice. I guess I don't have the skillz.Orders were taken promptly, and all beverages--the notorious blueberry lemon drop, a strawberry lemon drop and orange mojito--proved to be tasty and the right price, $4.99 each. Happy hour fixin's were $5 and tasty, but if you're gluten free, there's nothing on the HH menu to eat, so be warned. I ordered the "'Killer' Prawns," eating the seafood but gifting most of the bread to one of my table mates. Prawns were tasty. Birthday girl reported the steamers as divine, though she was disappointed there was only one chowder choice on the happy hour menu. The third in our party ordered calamari steak strips and did not complain, though did not rave about the dish, either.Our server did extend us a nice courtesy by taking my friend's blueberry lemon drop off the bill. Aw, he was nice.Will I go again for my friend's birthday if she wants to? You betcha. Will I go because I want to? Well, since I waddled out of there with my gluten-sensitive tummy quite bloated, probably not. Ordering a salad for $10.99-16.99 while my friends partake of the warm sourdough bread and gluten-ful $5 HH menu choices just makes me want to cry. Which is better than passing gas from a gutful of flour, I suppose. Went here for happy hour. Had the tuna wasabi quesadilla and some clam chowder. The quesadilla was so-so and the clam chowder was flavorful but very gritty. You should probably not order it if you don't want a mouthful of sand....Also had a cocktail. It was ok but not as stiff as I would have hoped :(The server was very attentive and pretty nice though. I probably won't return here. Seriously, Duke's? A hundred bucks (BEFORE Tip!) for 3 cups of chowder, a club sandwich, an order of crab cakes and some salmon? Really? It wasn't even very good when all was said and done...upper mediocre at best.Yeah, you got the view and our server Tim was very nice- but next time we'll walk around the corner to BluWater- better atmosphere, better parking, better food and better prices.Come down to earth, Duke's and get over yourself. This isn't the usual kind of restaurant that i eat at but i did go today and was pleasantly suprised. I had the veggie burger which isn't on the menu so you have to ask for it but the waitress told me about it and said that a lot of people like it so i tried it. I wasn't expecting much but this burger was actually really really good. I liked the avacado, tomato, and cheese on it and the sauce was really good. My dad had the chefs special which he says was good but didn't like the sauce that it came it. Maybe something to try, but the place isn't too unique or anything. It's good for what it is Went here after a wonderful run at Greenlake. The service was quick, friendly and the food was sizzling. I had the Mahi Mahi tacos and Duke's awarding winning clam chowder. &#160;My friend had the Chowder sampler where a small scoop of Dungeness Crab &amp; Bourbon Chowder, Cajun Chicken Corn Chowder, NW Seafood Chowder, and Lobster Pernod Chowder are put into adorable little shell shaped bowls. &#160;We both came to the conclusion that the Original and the Cajun Chicken Corn Chowder were the best. &#160; Must try: Cajun Chicken Corn Chowder and their Mojitos! I got some chowder besides the Dukes Chowder chowder. WHY would I do this. My boyfriend kept waving his Dukes Chowder chowder in my face while I slurped miserably on my bourbon crab chowder. (A tasty chowder but still a second-class chowder.)Would I go here for anything else besides chowder? Probably not. Duke's will only be my go-to place when I crave chowder. Just like I go to World Wrapps down the street only when I want a global wrap.I know nothing about Duke's - I know this is probably not the original Duke's - but this was a pretty cosy, family style place. Love the decor which puts you in a chowdery mood. Dukes is a classic for us, whenever we have people in town it seems like we always end up at dukes at least once. They have a really good selection for seafood eaters and non-seafood eaters alike. I am the latter. I myself generally get one of their burgers. Which are very good. Today we ate there and I got a slider burger which is a smaller portion of the cheeseburger, very hood portion. I also usually get the Cajun chicken and corn chowder which is also very good. I have been to this location as well as south lake union and alki, all are very good. We where seated in the bar. The bartender bitched the whole time about how busy she was. Our appetizer was disgusting, absolutely disgusting. She took forever to refill our drinks. Then when the food came out one of the orders was wrong, extremely wrong. They brought out some slice of fish when the person ordered crab cakes. This Dukes location provided poor customer service and poor food. Take the time and go to the one at the South Center Mall the food was amazing and great service there. Amazing! &#160;I have heard good things, and this place definitely lived up to the reputation. &#160;I am a sucker for good bloody mary's, and it's defintiely a plus that these ones come fully loaded with green olives and shrimp. &#160;Yum. &#160;I had the salad and chowder, also delicious. &#160;My husband had the jr. burger and fries, and they were gone in a second. &#160;The view is beautiful, and the food is great. &#160;We will have to try it for happy hour though because it was a little expensive. &#160;Also, the parking is terrible. So I go run around greenlake like I have a purpose. Then I see the chowder house on the first lap. I'm like mmmmm I should stop in there some day for happy hour. Well that day is always the day when I'm running around greenlake. Nothing more satisfying then getting my happy hour on after a long run to negate all the calories I just burned. And boy oh boy is the happy hour bomb. Spicy Ahi Quesadilla's. Yes tuna quesadilla's. Freaking delicious. 3 dollar cup of amazing chowder. By far the best chowder. And its 3 bucks. Can I get 3 orders of that please? Yeah I just ran around the lake. I'm hungry. Oh and can I wash it down with one of your duketails? Like the delicious 10cane sugar mojito. Because we all runners know. Nothing hydrates you like a delicious rum beverage. Great food. &#160;Better happy hour. &#160;$5 REAL cocktails (not Kamchatka vodka with sugar water - fresh juice and decent booze,) $5 size-able appetizers. &#160;I don't understand why more people aren't in here for happy hour. &#160;Late and early happy hour 4-6 and 9-close. &#160;They close early in the winter.Some of the chowders are too sweet for my taste, but they have great flavor. True confession? &#160;I've never made it past the chowder at Duke's. &#160;So, perhaps my review is a bit unbalanced. &#160;Nonetheless, the chowder is definitely worth writing home about.We went to Duke's with some friends last night and we all ordered various versions of their award winning soup. &#160;The word 'bourbon' had me at hello, so I went with the Dungeness Crab &amp; Bourbon, two friends had the original clam chowder in bread bowls, and another friend had a trio of sampler cups (crab &amp; bourbon, cajun chicken corn, and the original). &#160;We were all left speechless. . with delight. &#160;Our server was attentive and efficient, and he kept the sourdough loaves coming. &#160;Did I mention their tasty selection of beers on tap and their Duketails? &#160;The cucumber mojito is a-mazing! &#160;To our pleasant surprise, we received free chocolate chip cookies and vanilla ice cream after our dinner. &#160;No strings attached. &#160;The perfect ending to a perfect meal. Two stars to Duke's itself. The place--decor, furniture, schtick--is wilting and probably still successful due mainly to its proximity to Green Lake and ability to bring in tourists. It's also pricey, given the need for a rehab and, I think, the overall quality of the food.But FIVE TWINKLING STARS to their seafood chop salad. My mouth is watering as I type this that damn salad is so flavorful and memorable. Mild, never rubbery (in at least a dozen tries) shrimp and baby scallops with romaine, avocado, cashews, feta, and a lemon juice based dressing...an awesome mix of fresh and light ingredients with some more substantial, filling ones. The only thing that makes it better is its arrival in already-bite-size pieces. No knife necessary! Less work for lazy me!I can also tear into Duke's hunks of ultra sour sourdough bread like a caveman tears into a turkey leg. Very good chowder! 3.5 &#160; I round down. &#160; &#160;We came here on a Friday night and surprisingly it wasn't that packed. &#160;The patio was full..but plenty of room on the inside. &#160;Initially, I was impressed by the cocktails. &#160;We had a cocktails with grapefruit zest and a hq vodka and it was very pleasing. &#160;Then came the food... &#160; &#160;  &#160;I always get calamari as my appetizer. &#160;That is my go-to. &#160;The calamari was a solid B, but the fact that all of the pieces looked pretty uniform made me question the source of this calamari. &#160;The clam chowdah was pretty good....but a few days later at Ray's..I think I found my fave. &#160; The lady friend had the bourbon and dungeness chowdah and it was far and aways better than the "famous" clam chowder.  &#160; The service was meh, the drinks were good , and the halibut and Caesar Salad with crab) were a solid Three stars. &#160; If I'm in the neighborhood and want a few drinks...I'll swing through and get my GQ on...but if I'm hungry and want some great food, I'll keep on driving. I love this place, it's in my neighborhood. One of the best happy hours imo. Love the happy hour food/prices, and their scratch margarita's, is probably one of the best!! But the service isn't the greatest. It seems like after the employee's work shift, they all hang out in the bar and chit chat with the ones that are still working (even the manager) and customer's who are paying full price for food are overlooked.Still an alright place to go once a month for happy hour, but their full price menu is pricey. Some of the best food for the money in the Seattle area. &#160;I love their Mac and Jack Beer Battered fish and chips. &#160;Their crab chowder is also delicious. &#160;Great drinks also. One of my favorite restaurants. &#160;Great food, especially if you are a fan of fresh seafood or their well known chowder. &#160;Friendly staff, comfortable laid back atmosphere and one of the best deck's to hang out on if the sun comes out. I came here on my 21st birthday with my boyfriend and to be honest, I was a bit hesitant about going to Duke's after reading the reviews on how poor the service here is, but I did anyway!To my surprise, everything from the food, to drinks, to service and even the complementary warm sourdough bread &#160;was on par! He ordered the 3 course meal which comes with a chowder of your choice (lobster chowder), salad (wild greens), and an entree (fish &amp; chips) ($19). I got the dungeness crab &amp; prawn gnochi with shiitake mushrooms in a creamy sauce ($20). It was all so delicious and we were more than satisfied. THe chowder here really does live up to its reputation as the best!They also have good drinks here and most are about $8. Best of all, when I ordered my first drink, I didn't get carded! Yay for finally being 21 :)Dinner came out to be about $55, which is not bad for all that food! I will be back! Every time I've been to Duke's before (and it's been years) it seemed like it was just so expensive. Good, yes, but who has two thumbs and doesn't want to pay $10 for a bowl of soup? This girl!But after today, I'm seeing that happy hour might be the way to go. They have quite a selection of specialty drinks like margaritas and mojitos for $4.99, well drinks and draft beers for $2.99, and appetizers and burgers for $4.99. We got a blackened chicken quesadilla and the crab dip. The portions were small, but we weren't looking to get filled up so that wasn't necessarily a bad thing. The quesadilla was good, made with a tortilla that was crispy and had fake orange cheese, like a cheez-it! The crab dip was good, but maybe a bit too heavy on the dip and too light on the bread. Do you want to know who has two thumbs and will now go back to Dukes often for happy hour? This girl! I went to this location this past week while traveling in Seattle. I was very impressed with the lobster chowder. I only wish I had gotten a bowl rather than a cup. It's one of the best I've had. I like Duke's more and more with every visit. &#160;My biggest complaint is that you are practically guaranteed to leave in a food coma whether you are there for happy hour or dinner.This time we went to the Greenlake location for happy hour. Draft beers (including Mac &amp; Jack) for $2.99. Hecks yeah! $4.99 appetizers are a good deal for what you get (both quality and portion size). We shared the Dangerously Killer Prawns and my boyfriend ordered the Tuna Wasabi Quesadilla. I thought the prawns looked better than they tasted, but they were still good; my fav part was the bread the prawns are served on. I didn't try the quesadillas but my BF quite enjoyed them. I decided to go out on a limb and try the chowder (when in Rome...). A cup is $3.99, a bowl is $5.99, add $1.99 for the sourdough bowl. I went with that cause as I mentioned in my review of the Lk Union location, the sourdough bread at Duke's is the bomb. I hadn't had chowder in years cause the creaminess usually grosses me out, so I was a little nervous about my order. Well, I shouldn't have been cause it was awesome and perfect. Not too fishy or creamy, just really really good. I was impressed. We both left stuffed and had to walk around the entire lake to justify the meal. High five to the Duke.Get coupons for registering online. &#160;Outdoor patio is nice in warm weather. &#160;Indoor fireplace can leave you roasting. &#160;Decent service. &#160;Happy hour is in the bar only. &#160;Nice view of the lake. &#160;Parking can be a pain depending on time of day. &#160;While we were there a couple employees from the Lk Union restaurant were hanging out, which I take as a pretty good sign that employees like their jobs and the food. Absolutely phenomenal! They made a believer out of me. The best gourmet burgers, fried calamari, and gourmet chicken sandwiches in the northwest. You like Red Robin fries? Try Duke's...the competition will be over.The best dang happy hour period. And, easy on the wallet. I love it. It's got a view of Green Lake and on sunny days the deck gets incredibly packed. Luckily I've never had to wait long. The chowders are all scrumptious especially the cajun chicken corn chowderGet on the birthday club so that you can get a free dinner during your birthday month and they also email u coupns and tell you about other discounts You really can't beat sitting out on the patio on a warm afternoon or evening. &#160;I of course had to try the chowder sampler seeing as this was a chowder house. &#160;It was SOOOOO tasty! &#160;I also split a crab and avocado sandwich which was just ok. &#160;The sauce that came on it just didn't taste right. &#160;The warm sourdough bread that they start &#160;you off with is really yummy and warm. &#160;Very easy to stuff yourself on this before the meal comes. &#160;I'm not sure what the inside is like, but I'm already thinking about another lazy afternoon on the patio! Nothing brightens up a rainy day in Seattle like sitting next to a window hunched over a bowl of clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl. When a friend of mine moved closer to the Green Lake area, we found ourselves frequenting the restaurant for happy hour with the usual Mac and Jack compliment or a Blue Moon for those days when we felt we needed something a bit lighter. The prices for happy hour are decent with a cup of chowder at around four dollars while a bowl is about seven dollars plus an additional two dollars or so for a sourdough bowl unless you happen to have an inside track with the waitress. Although the service is a bit slow, it was often nice to settle ourselves in with a few beers before our chowder anyhow. There are a few other locations, but we swear by this location for its local charm when compared to some other locations such as the odd one located at the Westfield Southcenter Shopping Mall though that topic will be dealt with in our next review. Their clam chowder is good, not excellent. &#160;It's supposedly award winning. &#160;In my opinion, it's a copy of Legal Seafood's.I like the ones in Maine, the thinner, more broth-y, more chunks of meat chowders more.If you like the thicker chowders, you'll like Duke's.Oh yeah, their fish and chips could be better. &#160;Fish wasn't really that good. &#160;Fries were wedge-cut. &#160;Just kinda ok. I'm not big on soups, but Dukes Chowder House is definitely worth a stop. &#160;Their chowder is very tasty and fulfilling. &#160;I wish they had a place like this in Hawaii for those "cold" winter nights. &#160;Oh well, I'll have to settle for it on my visits to Seattle. &#160;Good thing, I only come during the winters. I don't think anything else here is good except the chowder and maybe the seasonal clams they have, which is hard to mess up unless you're a really bad cook.. We've tried a few main courses but we've never liked any, we've had better..When you first sit down, you get sourdough bread to start with.. I don't enjoy their sourdough because it always feels stale.. I've tried the Cioppino, which has a good serving of seafood but the flavors were bland and after a few bites you get bored.. Salt and pepper helps..Their stuffed halibut with crab and shrimp came to my table looked like it was a splat of crap on the plate.. There was no presentation at all, flavor-wise it was okay, not great.. The sauce over-powered the sweetness of the fish.. The bf had the mahi-mahi tacos and it was too sweet for our liking.. The tacos also came out of the kitchen looking sloppy, and it was dripping wet on the tortillas and it didn't look very appetizing.. Bold flavors, but once again, over-powering..The fish and chips are nothing to shout about either, I'd rather go to Spud if it was not because Duke has a full bar.. The service isn't great either on a busy day, our server never refilled our glasses of water and I was left on a busy warm day sucking on the ice on the bottom of my glass..Otherwise, go ONLY for the chowder and steamed clams.. Really good clam chowder options! Duke's has a great happy hour, with both indoor and outdoor seating, which is something I absolutely love whenever the sun is shining. Unfortunately I can't comment on their entrees, since I only come here or happy hour.If you haven't already, you must try their clam chowder, even moreso since it's in the restaurant's name. Ivar's famous clam chowder is still my local favorite, but Duke's clam chowder is a close second. In reality, I can't really choose between them since they have different flavor profiles and consistencies, so try both and you'll see what I mean. Aside from that, the food is also really good and the portions are plentiful. I'm a big fan of the manila clams as well as the quesadilla. Made a trip to Duke's something of a farewell dinner for my dad who came to visit Seattle. &#160;We had tried a lot of the U. District staples, like dirt cheap Thai food, but still felt we hadn't that enchanting Pacific Northwest take on seafood - something entirely mystical and magical to most native Coloradans. &#160;He suggested we try a restaurant he had passed by a few times: Duke's Chowder House. &#160;When we went for dinner there was no line, and no problem getting a table by the edge, with a charming urban view of a couple of streets, and beyond those, Green Lake mobbed by fitness gurus and commuters. &#160;We started the meal with the bread, a delicious but simple coupling of sourdough and a flavorful butter. &#160;Then we moved into an appetizer of the "Steamers" - a plate of clams served something like meuniere mussels. &#160;Delicate, flavorful, and for me, a first time eating a dish where clams were the primary ingredient. &#160;Then came the chowder. &#160;Dad got the world famous chowder while I opted for the Northwest seafood chowder. &#160;His was the standard white and creamy chowder, which while passing itself as a snooty version of a street food classic, seemed somewhat too aloof. &#160;Mine was more of a Manhattan style, heavy on tomatoes, and generous with bites of salmon, Alaskan halibut, and even more clams. &#160;Spicy too, and definitely gave the white chowder something of a run for its money. &#160;This, and a couple of rounds of bread and soaked up steamer sauce made for a hefty, tasty meal. &#160;Ambience is good too, especially for someone in the market for a new bike. 3.5 stars actually.EXCELLENT service. Very prompt and courteous. Drink refills + regular checks on us to see if anything felt amiss. Food - We ordered - their famous clam chowder, fish + chips, fisherman's favorite (mussels, shrimp, salmon in rosemary broth), a salmon entree (sorry don't remember what this was, they all seem the same), and the seafood cioppino (the same as the fisherman's favorite but in a tomato base). I thought everything tasted normally, but nothing very unique. I thought their clam chowder WAS pretty good though. Price - each entree we ordered was about $15, which I think was okay but a little pricey for fish + chips+ chowder. Ambiance + space is cool + quarky. I can dig the paddles with santa hats on them. I mean, who can't? =D I've never been here for dinner, but Duke's is a great little lunch place-- I've been to the West Seattle location as well, but the Green Lake one is a lot easier.Definitely get the chowder, if the name didn't all ready tell you that. &#160;All of them are good, but the lobster pernod chowder is to die for. &#160;My order has usually been the chowder and salad combo with mixed greens. &#160;Their fish n' chips and crab dip are both pretty tasty, but I wouldn't recommend the crabby patty-- it's not as good as it sounds.The birthday club email list is a good deal, because you get good coupons every once in a while and not much in terms of spam and newsletters.
- Locale Destination - It's on 45 Th St and Latona Ave NE in NE Seattle. (Wallingford)The restaurant was a house. Unless you see the big sign at the front, you wouldn't notice as a restaurant. Decor is very chic - white, woods, splash of pink - like a cafe. Very cute. Bathroom is upstairs. No parking, so park on the streets by the restaurant. Nice and friendly service.- Gluttony Expedition - Spicy Ocean: Tons of seafood (mussels, salmon, squids, shrimps) and vegetables (bamboo shoots, bell peppers, mushrooms, green beans, Thai basil etc.). Seafood was cooked very well - very tender. The sauce was spicy and sweet. Good. I tried #3 spiciness (out of 5), which was maximum for me and very good/spicy. For $15, the amount of seafood and vegetables were amazing. Good dish. - Conqueror's Deduction - This was unexpectedly good. It's a bit strange to see "gyoza" (Japanese pot stickers) at Thai restaurant (they call themselves "Contemporary Asian fusion cuisine"), yet my dish wasn't so Americanized and got a good Thai flavors. For the quality and quantity, this was very reasonable. Great find ;) Yum Yum YumYum Yum YumYum Yum...errr...all the way?Sorry - I just, really loved the food I had delivered from this place on Friday night. &#160;The appetizer platter came with fried veggie rolls, crab rangoon, fried tofu and gyoza, all of which were awesome and fried and awesome and not healthy! &#160;The pad see ew and panang curry were both fantabulous as well - I had the pad see ew with shrimp and there were at least 15-20 good size shrimp in it! &#160;Way generous compared to the norm and plum and tender - plus the size of the dish as a whole was ridiculous - easily would feed three. &#160;The panang curry had tons of chicken and peppers and onion in it and was deliciously spicy and also made for three good sized plates. &#160;All in all I'm super bummed that they only deliver to my buddy's house and not all the way to mine, but I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it and will probably get take out from them in the future. My roommate and I order from Djan's at least once a week (through Eat24) and we love almost everything we've tried, especially the crab rangoons and fusion noodles. Super delicious. We really like that their spice levels are consistent and the 4 and 5 levels are HOT. More hot than a lot of other Thai places.Also: NO styrofoam delivery containers. Very important to me. Had the Penang and it was top notch. The samurai phad Thai was also groovy. Ambience was casual but upscale. If you are looking for some good Thai look no further Djan's Dining is the best Thai food I've had in Seattle so far. &#160;My husband and I have been to the restaurant once but mostly order our food. The place is a cute, minimalist, white space (which I liked) and the service was on point.. &#160;They have a particularly delicious egg plant dish (I don't remember the name), and tasty Pad Thai and garlic chicken mmm. &#160;In certain days the delivery took a bit longer than expected, but these orders were during peak hour times on rainy days, any other time the delivery was on time (this time delay is why I gave 4 stars vs. 5 stars in rating). I have only ordered from Djan's once and it was take away, but based on this order I am reluctant to order again. I ordered Pad Thai so that I could compare to Sea Thai, where i have ordered in the past. Boy, what a difference. Maybe tonight was an off night for Djan's, maybe they have a new cook or something. I will probably give them another try, but this order was seriously sub par. No spice, no condiments, no peanuts, no scallions, very few bean sprouts, no flavor, just a pile of noodles and some over-cooked meat. Way too little care for $13. Sea Thai is way ahead of this.I want to point out that the food was on time and the staff was friendly and polite. Still, I had to get into the kitchen and finish this Pad Thai myself. I love this place, great food and they deliver to me which is even better. The garlic beef or tofu if awesome as is the djan fried rice and it comes with curry chicken pieces on top so it's a meal. Don't &#160;order the pad se ew for delivery, it gets mushy, not sure how it is in house. My biggest problem with this place is the inconsistency on the spice stars. I've order 4 stars and 1 star on the same dish and it was exactly the same. Other times 1 start was 1 star. There's no way of knowing what you'll get at each visit. This is a major problem when sharing with a child or if your personal tastes are for the mild. If you like spicey then you'll have no problem. The restaurant itself is an old bugalow house on N 45th in Wallingford. Would be good for a quiet dinner but not great for kids as you can hear everyone else and kids would be heard for sure. Overall great food and service. Worth a try. Cute Thai restaurant with a nice clean, warm atmosphere. My friend and I ordered from here last night (delivery). Usually, I get Thai food from a place down the street, but we needed the food delivered and had limited options - good thing. I'm glad to have finally tried Djan's, after driving by it for years. We got the Pad Khee Mao and the Pad See Eiw (both of our favorite noodle dishes)? We agreed that they were the best we'd ever tried in Seattle. The veggies were flavorful and cooked just right and the tofu was excellent. We were impressed that the noodles were not all glued together, like often happens with delivery food. I thought the prices were reasonable for the Wallingford and the delivery was so fast for a Friday might. They said 45-60 minutes, but they arrived in 20! The portions were also generous. I will definitely be choosing Djan's from now on. When you need some Pad Thai and you need to eat it in your jammies within about a half hour... look no further! I can only offer delivery rated opinions, but I asure you my palate is as fine tuned at home as it is in person. The spring rolls are fresh, the (fried) tofu is crisp, and the pad thai is delightfully flavorful. Definitely a go-to in Thai delivery! Definitely the cleanest and freshest tasting thai food around the area. &#160;I order delivery from here every couple weeks or so and the food always comes on time and hot. &#160;Only complaint is that soemtiems I'll ask for 4 or 5 start spiciness and it's still not strong enough for me.
This is a converted house with linen napkins, pleasant decor, tea light candles, and a reasonable amount of off street parking for the neighborhood. I asked for recommendations and was thrilled by the Saute Eggplant with chicken. The mango rice was an excellent dessert. The wine list was a good balance of depth, tastiness, and cost. Quite an exceptional experience at the same price as those cheesy strip-mall, noisy, plastic table cloth Thai joints. Great value. Great meal. Whenever people ask me for Thai recommendations in the U-district or Wallingford, I recommend Djan's. It's the best quality Thai food, the most affordable, the best atmosphere, and the best service. It's in an old, white house on 45th, and the food is perfect. It's spicy, made with high-quality ingredients, and carefully prepared. Great food. Great atmosphere! My favorite Thai place in the City. &#160;You can dress up or dress down and fit in. The staff are all very nice and the food is always great. They have a couple of private rooms up stairs you can reserve which are great for birthday parties etc... very intimate. My only critique is they are slow to deliver..give them at least 45min to bring your food. Thai cuisine offerings are such that even the mediocre tend to be acceptable. The recipes rely on combining, contrasting, and complementing taste components, particularly spices. &#160;Widely regarded as a Thai food veteran among my colleagues, I traveled to the ostentatious land known as Wallingford to fortify my familiarity with the rarified upper reaches of the art. I actually have no idea what I just said, so I'll move onto my review.Djan (translates to "moon" in Thai, I believe) is a comfortable place, made cozy by such touches as swags atop the windows. The restaurant actually resides in what used to be a house. You'll find bedrooms turned into dining areas, and a bathtub in the restroom. For starters we had Chicken Satay, a signature Thai chicken skewer dish served with a peanut sauce. &#160;For the main course, we had Duck Curry and Drunken Noodles. &#160;Both were fatty, but oh so delicious. &#160;The Duck Curry's rich coconut flavor won our hearts. &#160;The Drunken Noodles were flavorful combination of salt and sweet (but a bit too sweet for my tastes, though). The portion size was generous, and promised leftovers for my lunch the next day. Djan's takeout: 5 starsDjan's Dining: 4 starsThe food is really delicious. My Panang Curry was perfection: thoroughly cooked but not rubbery veggies, tasty curry, and the chicken was tender (though pretty mild for a level 3 spiciness) and the Fusion Noodles are to die for. The curry puff appetizers are good as well and the sauce for them was delicious and flavorful. My favorite is the Tom Kha soup. Salty and sweet, with a thick broth and fresh ingredients. Yum!However, nearly an hour passed between ordering and getting our food, where we observed people who had come in after us get their food. Maybe a mix up in the kitchen? Their delivery is always prompt so I was disappointed to get slow service while dining in. I never thought Thai food would evolve into one of my comfort foods but Djan's has filled a void I never knew existed. &#160;Chances are if you order takeout, you will squeeze 2-3 meals out of a single entree. &#160;They don't skimp on the to-go orders and this single girl appreciates that! &#160; I'm borderline pescatarian but stick with their tofu dishes. &#160; Their pad thai, panang curry, and pineapple fried rice are fantastic. &#160;3 stars (on a scale of 1-5) could make you break a sweat...and I like that. &#160;Crab rangoon ain't too shabby either but let's face it, anything fried with cream cheese stuffing is going to be tasty.Dining in at Djan's is decent but the atmosphere isn't much to get excited about. &#160;People just come in for quiet conversation and good food. &#160;The house is cute but definitely has wear and tear. &#160;It doesn't take much effort to notice all the walls are scuffed. I'd hoped to rent the room upstairs for a birthday party in May of 2009 but they wanted to charge a pretty steep price for it on top of the food. &#160;That was a dissapointment. &#160;Plan to park on the streets around the restaurant. &#160;They have one or two spots in the &#160;back but you can't tell if there's room until after you pull off 45th and drive up the teeny driveway. &#160;It's just not worth even checking. After trying all of the Thai delivery places in the Wallingford area (all three of them) this place takes the cake. Sure, not everything on the menu is 5 star quality, but for everything that is so so, there is something fantastic on the menu. &#160;Also, this isn't one of those "greasy Thai" places. You know, the ones equivalent to getting Chinese food from the Safeway deli. The food here is fresh, spicy and usually very good. Definitely Order: &#160;I love all of their curries. Every one. The Cashew Chicken is great, as it the Pik Khing. The Papaya Salad is A-MAZING if you get it 3 or 4 stars. I think it would be boring any less spicy.Pass: Chicken Rama, Pad Thai, any of the fried rice. I have never dined in the restaurant (it is always take out and delivery for me) but it is a cute space and usually fairly empty. Don't be scared. I would guess that 70% of their business is delivery or take out. You can even order online (perfect for my phone order averse hubby). Oh my god this place was good. Went last weekend for a friends birthday and we rented out one of the rooms upstairs. Even with only one waitress for 17 people, service was timely and nice. The food was amazing but beware of their star system. I ordered a 2 star item and it was more like 3.5 The waitress was so awesome to even split up our checks!!! "Joel Anthony," - Charles Barkley"That's Jo-el," - Ernie Johnson "Whatever," - ChuckI can't even pronounce the name, but I didn't need maalox, pepto or tums afterwards. Maybe some prevacid. I had a wonderful dinner date here tonight, mainly cause the food was good and almost inconspicuous. Definitely a cut above other Thai restaurants with it's decor, design and ambiance, and I didn't feel like I had to question if the employees washed their hands. It's not the best Thai food I've had, but pretty good. Just a tad too spicy for my ruined stomach. Now, usually when I eat Thai food, I do like it about 3 stars and expect to sweat. Well, that doesn't work when you're out on a date. Yeah, sweating is no good. Thus I played it safe and got white-boy level 2-star. We got the Djan Fusion noodle dish and panang curry. She got 3-star, trying to kill me. The service was great. Stopped in for lunch one day and a decent Thai place. &#160;Now for those of you who live in Wallingford you know that every Thai person in the neighborhood owns their own restaurant. &#160;So it is in the context of competition that I give three stars...it competes on par with the majority of the other 17 places on 45th without standing out.Lunch specials are about a dollar more than the other places but are plentiful. &#160;The Pad Thai is not as overly sweet as some other places as well.The atmosphere is nice, in a quaint house with a nice decor. &#160;I am planning to go back for dinner with a Groupon so will update after that experience. I love any restaurant located in a house! They really optimized the coziness of this turn of the century home, maintaining the integrity of the structure while maximizing its best features. The decor is lovely and the staircase leads to a private dining area for groups upstairs. The food is excellent as well which can be tough to do in a city filled with Thai restaurants. This one is definitely worth the trip! Great food - checkGreat atmosphere - checkGreat service - check I have been in Seattle for 6 months, and so far this is the best restaurant I have found. The food is perfectly cooked for a fresh taste. A nice mix of vegetables with the meat dishes. The Pad Thai Fusion (I forget the exact name) is excellent, and the curry dishes, chicken/broccoli and others. Good appetizers and some great happy hour specials.
Djan's, I'm sorry it has taken me so long to write this review. Please don't be offended...I have ordered from you so many times there are no hard feelings, right? My affair with Djan's began last November, when I went here for my birthday dinner. The 9 us got a private room upstairs, all candlelit and perfect, for no additional cost! How wonderful! We had one waitress the entire night who was very attentive (and got a workout going up and down those stairs flawlessly with our hot plates!) I ordered eggplant and basil because it said "EAT ME!" while everyone else ordered family-style as to share. We got chicken pad thai, green curry, egg rolls, and something else. Basically everything was delicious. The thai iced coffee was also appropriately sized and priced, something which is very uncommon. I've been booty-calling Djan's for a late night fix ever since. Free deliveries over $15! Ok, it's pathetic I don't just bus but sometimes you just want something delivered to your doorstep so you can just continue being lazy. Everytime I call they say "45minutes" but they always come within 20! Now that's what I call "underpromise and overdeliver (literally, ha.ha)" -- it's a work ethic I like very much. I usually get the same fare every time: tom ka gai, pad thai, green curry or eggplant basil, and brown rice. This more than enough for 2 meals for me and my boyfriend combined.Their pad thai is seriously THE best in Seattle. It makes Thai Tom's mess of stomach-churning, rule-violating noodles look, well, like just what I described...disgusting. It is the perfect texture and sweetness. Mmm. I know I'm not very authentic in my Thai food but hey it tastes damn good. Their tom ka gai is always perfect (though I have to say my own recipe is pretty good also) and the little button mushrooms floating on top always gets my appetite on. Eggplant is consistently tasty, but still isn't quite as good as Sichuan Cuisine's...but that's just on a totally different level.Anyway.The green curry is delicious and definitely not curry paste stuff (I have the curry paste, I know how it tastes) and once I also got spicy basil chicken but that took my tongue off. I'd say the 5 stars is really 5 stars so I actually go for 4 [insert look of shock here] which is just enough spicy and just enough mild so I can actually taste the food without crying. Now I just reserve the crying for happiness when I get my Djan's delivered :) Such a cute and peaceful atmosphere. The private dining upstairs is intriguing for a birthday dinner or other celebrations. We had Fresh Spring Rolls, Cashew Nut with Tofu and the Djan's Fusion noodles, brown rice and a side of peanut sauce. I thought everything was perfect in flavor balancing and texture. They don't kid around with the spice. I am a big fan of the heat but would not order more than 3 or 4 stars next time. Great flavor in all the dishes we experience this evening. We will definitely return.**EDIT** I upgraded this tasty place to 5 stars after seeing that SeaThai across the street had 4 stars. That place is disgusting and dirty. This place is okay, but not great. My wife and I had lunch here -- she ordered the pad thai and I ordered the green curry. The pad thai had way too much sauce and was very sweet tasting -- overall not something we'd order again. The green curry was good, but I was a bit bothered that we were charged an additional $1.50 for rice to go with our $10 curry. I'm sorry, but curries should include rice. Nothing on the menu indicated that rice was not included, the waitress asked what kind of rice I wanted -- not _if_ I wanted rice. Curry without rice is like a sandwich without bread. Overall, I found the food to be okay but overpriced. Service was okay, but nothing special. I doubt we will return.On reviewing their website, it appears we were given the dinner menu and charged dinner prices even though we were there for lunch (at noon). One of the most important things about moving to a new city or neighborhood is finding good frontline take-out service for the three most important delivery food groups: pizza, Chinese and Thai. Fortunately, for those who live in North Seattle, Djans qualifies as a good choice to occupy the first chair for Thai take-out. First of all, Djans is flexible with delivery and take-out service with free delivery for orders over $15. The delivery range is 2.5 miles, which due to the strategic location in Wallingford, covers most of North Seattle. Second, the food is consistent and at the upper range for the Thai food genre. I confess that I haven't tried the entire lineup of Djan's take-out, usually ordering the Pad Thai/Fusion Noodle/Chicken Cashew Nut/Spring Rolls, but I've never been disappointed. They also do a good job with the spices and I'm a little wimpier here: they range their spices from 1 to 5 (5 being the spiciest) and I typically pick the "2". Prices are reasonable with the entrees in the $9-10 range.As for the restaurant itself, I've never actually dined in here, but I've stood around and wandered long enough to pretty much get a good feel of the place. Djan's is a converted house and the dining area is one room on the side. It has a minimalist design with a simple white background that seems to work. They also have gone with the eternal-Christmas approach of decorating by winding small holiday lights along the outside of the building.The check-out area is at the foot of the stairs and you'll be standing in the front hallway while you're waiting for your carry-out. In these converted houses, I've always wondered a little bit about what they have in the upstairs rooms. Storage? Banquet rooms? Secret meeting halls? I'm not a pyromaniac, but I've been tempted to start a small fire in a garbage can to distract them so that I can run upstairs and find out. I suppose I could also ask, but where's the fun in that? Good take-out restaurants are usually just that, for take-out only. Their atmosphere leaves much to be desired. Not so with Djans, Djan's is located in what used to be a house on 45th. It's all white, both inside and out, and had a very comfortable, airy, contemporary asian feel to it. It's a great place for a "date dinner" that won't break the bank but is romantic and intimate. They also have a party room upstairs that holds about 30 people. Oh, and the food? fantastic. Never too oily, great balance of flavors in the currys and a mix of standard thai fair (phad thai, phad see iew) as well as some signature dishes. Their prices are extremely reasonable, rivaling those of the cheap, atmosphere-less thai places everywhere else. Plus, they have a lunch special in which you get a mountain of food (curry, rice, a stir-fried noodle dish, a gyoza AND an entree dish) for about $7. Try this place immediately! But don't tell too many people, I still want to be able to get my take-out in under 10 minutes. I ordered Tom Yum soup for delivery. &#160;It came in about 40 minutes, which pleased me; however, there were no utensils or napkins! &#160;I just moved into a new apartment and have yet to buy silverware. &#160;This made it very difficult to eat the soup. &#160;I know most people have silverware, so I understand if Djan's is trying to cut cost by not handing them out to everyone, but at least ask the customer if they need them. &#160;As for the soup, it was okay, but I've had better. &#160;I think it could have used more lemongrass, or something. I first heard about Djan's from members of my department at the UW who'd had it delivered for meetings. Word was it was yummy, reasonably priced and that the delivery service was very reliable. When I was dogsitting in Ballard I could think of no better a kind of restaurant than this to order a bunch of food from and split into a couple days meals. It turns out word of mouth was correct - tasty food ordered online and delivered prompt, hot and well packed.I can't say the Djan's Platter blew me away, but I liked having an array of nibbles without having to by a bunch of sides. The Rama had a solid quality peanut sauce and the ingredients were of a pleasing quality. The runaway hit was the Saute Eggplant. Most restaurants violate the good name of eggplant with the gooey, lumpy dishes they put out. Djan's eggplant was flavorful and had just the right texture. It was firm without being undercooked and tender without being soggy. Yum!If you're looking for good delivery I much recommend Djan's. It's a nice break from pizza and so easy to enjoy. This thai food is as good as it gets, no doubt. &#160;Just watch out, the spiciness is the real deal! &#160;I recommend starting out with a 2. &#160;If you go with a 4 as I did the first time, you will be screeching like a 13 year old girl at a Jonas Brothers Concert. &#160;I'm pretty sure a 5 would cause you to incinerate your tongue.I recommend any of the pad thai dishes, particularly the Pad Khee Mao. &#160;The crab rangoon are excellent appetizers as well! &#160;Also, the curry is great! &#160;Service has always been outstanding (I have eaten in once, but mostly do take-out). &#160;Everybody is friendly, the place is pristine, and the food is outstanding, no place more deserving for a 5 star review! The pad see ew left me rather disappointed -- it had an unfamiliar smokey flavor to it, and the beef tasted so strange and "gamey" that typically carnivorous me opted to pick out the veggies and eat those instead of the beef + noodles. Recently the bf's been on a fortunate streak of picking out dishes I like better than my own -- in this case, he went for the special crispy trout fish which had a very good tangy/spicy/sweet sauce and was served on a bed of lettuce. Though you do have to pay extra for rice (*disapproving frown*) the jasmine rice was perfectly cooked which is (sadly) always a pleasant surprise when I go out.Unless you're really, REALLY craving chocolate and cheesecake, I'd advise against getting the toffee mousse and the lychee cheesecake. The mousse had the shape and texture of a slice of dense cheesecake, and neither of us could taste the Kahlua. Way too chocolatey. The NY cheesecake had the quality of a frozen grocery store brand, and the lychee component was little more than pureed lychees spooned over the cake, so the combination was a little jarring. The desserts were much too overpriced for what we received.The service was great though, and the cozy ambiance of the artfully decorated interior is enough to entice me back. Went here with the husband Saturday night for dinner and was very pleasantly surprised. I was a tad worried upon parking as it's pretty far down on 45th but once you go inside, it's pretty cozy and cute. We ordered the seaweed soup with chicken as a starter and it was really delish. Very nice smoky flavor to the chicken and the seaweed wasn't mushy, the flavors were great. Then we shared the Fire Scallops w/brown rice and ground chicken spicy salad. All were very good! The scallops weren't overcooked and had a great sweet and spicy flavor to it. Overall I was really pleased with this place and happy to discover a new great neighborhood thai place to go in or get take out from. When I first decided to move to Seattle, I knew I would make it my mission to seek out scrumptious Thai food. As my favorite type of cuisine (besides pizza ... and I'm not so sure pizza counts as cuisine) I was thrilled to hear Seattle was a keeper in the realm of Asian dishes. I have only ordered delivery from Djan's so far, to which the service was prompt and very friendly! Reading some of the other reviews I know I'll have to give a sit-down meal a try =) The ever-so popular pad thai was absolutely delicious, and I loved that I could choose my own spice intensity! For appetizers we got crab rangoon and dumplings which were fantastic. We also got scallops with vegetables as well which did not fail to satisfy and curb our mouth-watering hunger for the aromatic scents emitted from the tin countainers. Djan's just became my new top Thai. not the best ever, but a solid 3. &#160;I got it delivered, and it came faster than the website said it would--on a Friday night of a holiday weekend, that's pretty impressive. &#160;So obviously I am only rating it on the food, not on service or ambiance. &#160;I had fried veggie rolls (not terribly greasy and I liked the glass noodles inside) and the garlic lover with chicken--the chicken was grilled, which was tasty, but I could have used a few more veggies, it was kind of salty, and the heat factor was lacking. &#160;I ordered a 3, which is usually plenty for me--this barely registered. &#160;Overall, not bad--I'd try it again. Tasty food and important for some, delivery is offered. However, the restaurant failed to mention about a "delivery" charge, even though we were in the radius. That was a little annoying. I don't mind paying for it, I just didn't want to find out via a deliveryman while waiting for our food. Overall good quality and with prices were relatively reasonable, about 8-12 dollars for most dishes. I always thought this place was a catering only place - as it was in a somewhat awkward location, and the huge sign on the yard &#160;looks so industrial and the tables never seem to be set up outside.One adventurous night, we decided to try it. &#160;It wasn't too crowded but the table next to us was quite loud - which was awkward in such a small place - a converted house.I have recently decided that I would start eating darker meats again, so why not start with duck? I forgot how duck tastes. Therefore, I did not especially enjoy the fatty duck with bones. But the sauce was good, and I enjoyed the spring roll appetizers, and the wine.Nothing phenominal, but it was refreshing to have a clean modern atmoshpere that wasn't typical for Asian food. The food is good at this place, but it is definitely pricier than most Thai places in Seattle. It's an elegant place, but I usually order for takeout (one of the few Thai places I can find that will deliver to my house).They have been good about accomodating vegan requests, which is important to me. &#160;We just don't order from them very often because of the prices. I can overlook that more if we dine-in, but for takeout it's hard to justify. We eat here a lot and I have never had bad food here. &#160;The pad thai and fusion noodle dishes are the best in the neighborhood. Although I just had fairly good take-out from Djan's, I am annoyed that their website does not reflect their current menu prices. I was confused when the total bill was several dollars higher than I expected. The fusion noodles are very tasty and at 3 stars have a fair amount of bite. The eggplant with beef is mild and good over perfectly steamed brown rice. Unfortunately, the eggplant seemed greasy like it soaked up the oil in the fryer. I would have enjoyed this dish much more if the eggplant had been prepared with more care.I ordered two appetizers: crab rangoon and tempura tofu. They both left something to be desired. The tofu was not very good at all. It lacked the light crispiness definitive of tempura batter. The peanut sauce was fairly terrible. &#160;The crab rangoon was mistake to order all together. It's made with imitation crab.Djan's is somewhere between a 2.5 and 3.0 star take-out experience. I plan on making some better menu selections in the future and I will probably steam my own rice at home. 2 dollars per person for brown rice is ridiculous. Wow this place is cool. I was not expecting the interior to be the way it is from walking up to the house. It's really nice. I ordered the fusion noodle which is their specialty mix of pad khee mao and pad thai. It was delicious. I also enjoyed their tofu. It was hearty and came in good size chunks. Sometimes at thai places they fry tiny pieces of tofu so long that they get huge and puffy - and filled with oil. I wish this place were on the ave so they could be closer to me! Definitely give them a try. On the outside, it looks like someone's house and you question yourself if you came to the right place. The inside has a nice, romantic atmosphere with some modern Asian style...even the bathroom! The food is always so good with perfect portions and low prices. I had the green curry and my friend had the Djan fusion noodle...both of which I recommend. The service is very friendly and they even come check up on you which is nice. Makes me wish I lived in Wallingford so I can stop by here and order take-out whenever I want. Love it :) I can't find any thai food in seattle better than Djan's. &#160;The dishes are very tasty, and vegetables are never overcooked. &#160;I am a big fan of the pad kee mao and all of the curry dishes (especially green)! &#160;Service is generally very fast and attentive unless you are caught in the middle of an unexpected rush. What sets Djan's apart from other Thai places is not the quality of the food but the atmosphere. &#160;It is situated in a little white vintage house off 45th. &#160;Hardwood floors, strategic and soft lighting and a spare, modern aesthetic make this place feel much higher class than your average Thai restaurant. &#160;That being said, the food is decent. &#160;Nothing ever tastes bad here but you can get better at other places. &#160;I have enjoyed their fusion noodle (a mix of phad thai and phad kee mao), green curry and recently, the garlic lover's stir-fry. &#160;If I am craving good Thai food and don't care if the atmosphere is up to par, I would go elsewhere. &#160;But if I am craving decent Thai food to be enjoyed in a low-key, relaxed atmosphere I'd pick Djan. &#160;I like that you feel you are having dinner in someone's home, like a dinner party. &#160;And I agree with a reviewer below who mentioned that they charge for an order of rice even if you're ordering curry. &#160;And we all know that no one eats curry without rice, so it's annoying and stingy of them to do this.
i only eat at two thai restaurants. thai siam is one of them. super yummy food, excellent service, great atmosphere. i would recommend it, but i want to keep it to myself. thanks thai siam! Thai food &#160;which 95% of the time is done right here. My only complaint is that the spice/ heat level is the most intense I have experienced. The difference between 2 and 3 stars will get you in trouble fast if you " think" you can handle it. A pedestrian dish like phad thai is excellent and always a good entree option. My mouth drools when I think about ordering out or dining in there.Laid back ambience and nice decor. Never had a bad experience with them even when busy. It's good food done well. Try the chicken delight! &#160;It is awesome. &#160;Chicken, peppers, onions, cashews in a sweet-savory sauce with rice. &#160;Mmmmm.Their salad is pretty good...I think it has blended up hardboiled egg yolks in it and a touch of mustard. &#160;These guys make a kickass Tom Ka Gai. &#160;Small is plenty for two as a starter!I've had several things on the menu - all good. &#160;Very nice people and quality ingredients. &#160; I sure wish they delivered.One caveat: &#160;BEWARE THE STARS. &#160;Their stars increase heat by an exponential amount. &#160;One star is one star. &#160;A little kiss of heat. &#160;You can handle this one no problem.Two stars is two stars. &#160;You should like a little burn, but it won't kill you or make you cough.Three stars is FOUR stars. &#160;This is the "fuck you, roundeye! Ha ha ha!" rating. &#160;Four stars, at Thai Siam, is like SIX FRIKKIN STARS anywhere else. &#160;Or, as my Mr says, it's the "Face the fury of my ancestors!!!" rating.I really like hot food. &#160;Their 3 star was at my LIMIT. &#160;Most people who like it pretty darn hot like it 2-1/2 stars. &#160;Be careful, be very very careful.If you order anything above 2 stars, the server is likely to raise his/her eyebrows and ask, "have you had (whatever) stars here before?" &#160;When they ask this, don't be macho. &#160;Unless you want to be shooting fire outcher butt later. PS &#160;Now they offer a side of Pad Thai at lunch for a measly $2. &#160;This is not bad, considering there is no spice in it. &#160;This can be your dinner or lunch the next day. &#160;Super happy deal! Amazing food, service is... almost as good as the food; nothing exemplary though. The building doesn't look like much, I sure didn't expect a lot when I saw it from the street. But I guess Thai Siam is a true hole in the wall in that regard. I've never had a bad meal here, their phad thai is amazing, as is everything else I've ever had the pleasure of tasting and ordering there. Be aware that they do really crank the heat up on dishes when you get beyond 3-stars. I usually get 4-stars at other places, but 3-stars here is equivalent to most others 4 (and even 5) star spice ratings. I tried the 5-star phad thai there (I don't know why, don't ask) and had tears in my eyes; 6-hours after my meal was no picnic either, beware! Katie S. broke down their star rating system a hell of a lot better than I could ever hope to; refer to hers.Prices are typical Seattle-thai, expect to pay around $12 a plate (on average). The food is totally worth it and the portions are large. Just remember you're coming here for the sheer deliciousity as oppose to saving a bundle. Don't be surprised if you have to wait a bit to get seated on a friday or saturday night; I would just hang outside as the waiting area right in the front of the place can get very crowded and you'll have people stepping on your feet on their way in and out of the place.I don't make it up to this part of town too often, but Thai Siam is definitely one of my favorites when I'm in the area.
I love this place. It is one of the best Thai places in Seattle that I have tried. &#160;PLUS, it is only a few blocks from my house. BONUS!! :) It is a spicy star though so be careful when adding &#160;the heat. Yeah so this place is pretty much awesome. I said I wanted my phad thai HOT and for once, it was freakin' HOT! This place isn't watered down for white people taste, so order a rating of 5 and expect it to taste like a 5.The building is awfully unassuming, but inside the decor is actually really nice. Friendly staff and really good phad thai that is more on the fish sauce flavored side and not the sweet side. Really awesome portion too! I had to take home a box and then even though I wasn't hungry an hour later after getting home I ended up eating the rest anyway because it was so good.
Closest thing to authentic Thai food in Seattle. Since traveling to Thailand, I've struggled to find 'real deal' &#160;here in Seattle. I've still yet to find the perfect Thai joint, but in the mean time, I can be found here.Everything on the menu is great- a few of my favs:*the happy boat*garlic shrimp*fresh rolls*phad see iew*chicken satay appetizerAhhgg.. Starving! I'm about to call in my order right now.. Spicer than most places, so order down a star if you're uber sensitive to hot-ness.Two 'happy boats' ahoy! Thai Siam opened in 1987 - I was 6 years old. I was also the only one of my siblings who enjoyed spicy food, along with my dad, so we would go on father-daughter dinner outings at Thai Siam, living not too far away.It probably says something, that this has been my favorite Seattle restaurant for 21 years. (: The food is always fresh, and they are very accommodating about my food allergies. My boyfriend and I were there a few weeks ago. We ordered the spring rolls, and requested peanut sauce instead of plum sauce - you know how most restaurants bring a tray of peanut sauce that is either cold (because it has been sitting in the refrigerator) or room temperature? Ours was WARMED. Warm peanut sauce for dipping. Brilliant! Our dinner dishes were absolutely delicious, and their dessert menu will make you do a double-take. If you frequent Thai restaurants (in any city or state in the US), you're probably familiar with the standard desserts - black sticky rice with coconut milk, sweet sticky rice with mango, coconut ice cream, sometimes banana fried in coconut milk. Well.. I don't want to give too much away, but Thai Siam has a few DELICIOUS surprises up their sleeve - creative desserts that I've never seen anywhere else.I give 'em five stars, because they rock! They rocked when I was six years old, and they have rocked ever since. For me this was the spiciest Thai I've had in Seattle, normally I have to ask for the chili tray and add more spice to my dishes but that wasn't the case here. &#160;I went with the Phad Prig King Shrimp, green beans and shrimp sauteed with red curry paste and I'm glad I was a wimp and only went with 3 stars because this stuff was spicy, it made my nose run and my eyes tear a little all in a good way of course. &#160;The leftover however were a little too spicy for me but I still ate them.The service was great they were very gracious and helpful with our large group. And made sure we had plenty of water around to help with the heat. Mamma-Mia! Thatsa spicy Pad Thai-a!!*Four stars of Thai heat and my mouth was burning. Burning so good, so very good!However, hotness doesn't equal taste, and, sometimes, is used to mask sub-par cooking or seasoning. This pad thai - a safe bet when trying a new Thai place - was tasty AND hot. Also, ordered and eaten, the fresh rolls were excellent and the peanut sauce was delicious.My dinner companions seemed to enjoy their entrees also, based on the grunts of ecstasy or pure silence due to food was devoured. I know the line at Thai Siam gets pretty long, so account for that if going during popular dinner hours.*Sorry, I don't know any culturally-stereotypical sayings from Thailand. This will have to do, for now. I remember a conversation the group over at Laadla had in regards to spicy food was that flavor was important and shouldn't be covered up in red pepper flakes. Well, the garlic pork I had was definitely covered in it. It actually wasn't bad, but it just didn't look right. I couldn't taste much of the garlic either. I think my four star was ratcheted up a couple more stars because it looked like the dishes that the six star people had. Even Michael O. made the same observation when it arrived. Mitzie H's three star green bean and prawns was very good too, but I really couldn't gauge its spiciness since my mouth was on fire. Thank god for that delicious Thai iced coffee!The service here was very good and were accommodating for our large group. Thanks for keeping the water glasses full! For a little place on 15th, this is delicious. I eat a lot of Thai food, and this place ranks in my top three. Delicious sauces= mmm. The dining room is small, but what you sacrifice in ambiance, you receive in taste. This place is absolutely delicious! I just went here this afternoon and was pleasantly delighted by their customer service as well! If you love spice, then this is the place. &#160;Be very careful on how many stars you get. I love hot and I got three stars on my Phad Thai and was relieved that I didn't go any further! If you love Thai, go here! It is pretty damn good thai. &#160;The food is always good and so is the service. &#160;I am unhappy with their lack of fish sauce. &#160;They do a lot of take out service which is great if you are doing takeout (highly recommended) &#160;but the layout and size makes the takeout customers part of the dining experience which is why I docked them a star...but for a thai place off the beaten path it is good stuff. You might miss this lil' shack by the side of the road if you're not looking for it. It's pretty non-descript. However, the food - and its presentation - is anything but. For instance, they bring your soup in something that looks like a freakin' rocket engine. We got some Tom Kah Gai served up with a thirty-foot flame shooting out of the top. (I exaggerate only slightly.) Also, my wife, who is Asian, pointed out that the native-to-colonist ratio in the house was about 30 to 1, and she thinks that's always a good indication that the food is the real deal. This place is sort of hidden along the stretch of 15th Ave NW between 80th and 85th. &#160;In fact, I had never seen it before until I happened to be looking closely for restaurants in the area while I was driving by. &#160;When I did see it, I actually laughed to myself, thinking that the place couldn't really be that great, because the building was hideous.I don't know how I could have judged a book by its cover, but I did. &#160;Luckily, a friend of mine who was in town visiting told me that it was her favorite place to get Thai when she's in town, so we decided to go there. &#160;Thank goodness we did because it is fantastic! &#160;The servers are friendly and attentive and the service is so very quick. &#160;Our food was delicious and some of the best Thai I'd had in quite some time. &#160;Since I will be moving to Greenwood next month, I'll be sure to go to this place often! &#160;It was great.A quick warning: Be careful when ordering spicy food! &#160;For even my friend, who loves spicy food, 4 stars is far FAR too much spice. &#160;Reading other reviews, it's clear that Thai Siam uses more spice than other Thai restaurants in the area. Went here recently for the first time with my wife and our 3-year-old son. &#160;We ordered coconut milk for our son, which they serve in the coconut, ala "Gilligan's Island" style, which was a hoot! &#160;Meanwhile, we enjoyed several of our favorite Thai dishes, all of which were very tasty and reasonably priced. &#160;If you're looking for a good Thai restaurant in Ballard/Crown-Hill, you can't go wrong here. Non locals often find it hard to find a good spicy asian cuisine in the Pacific Northwest. &#160;Thai Siam is your answer. &#160;The food tastes great and they know how to make things spicy. &#160;They rate in 1-5 stars and 4 stars is really the best. &#160;It's got some serious kick that will melt the pasty white folk up north but provide just the right amount of burn for those of us accustomed to flavor. &#160;The tom kah gai is very good indeed.The restaurant is quite small and can fill up quickly. &#160;They are kid friendly but only have two high chairs. We eat here at least twice a month. I ALWAYS run into somebody I know here because it is that popular!~ Great Food Great Service - Always consistent! That's an A+ in my book for any restaurant!Our faves are the Tom Kha Soup and the angel wings for appetizersFor the main dish, they have good pad thai and also good yellow curry but the absolute best is the Top of the World Beef - what do they marinate that with - whatever it is -- MY GOODNESS!I've actually ordered some of that sweet chili oil they serve with the angel wings and top of the world beef &#160;---to go. It's good on salads - nice and fresh.My dishes have typically been spicy even for a &#160;2 star so order accordingly. Located right on 15th across the street from Safeway in Ballard/Greenwood. I can usually &#160;find parking but there is also street parking. When I lived in Ballard I would get a to-go order of Tom Ka Gai from Thai Siam a few times a month. &#160;It's the perfect cold weather soup - especially if you have the balls to order it spicy.Even now that I live closer to Wallingford and Greenlake I'll still get a to-go order from time to time. &#160;But it's not just the food that keeps beckoning me back.Thai Siam has been hosting an annual fundraiser that has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for local non-profits. &#160;It's been written up the various newspapers and the owner has received accolades left and right . . . as she should. &#160;If only all establishments were this visible with their support of the community where they make their money. 'Twas a disappointing first go. I ordered the Garlic Lover and asked for 3 stars spicy. The woman taking the order took a half step back and asked, rather shocked, "Have you had three star here?" I said I hadn't, as this was my first visit. I've never had a particularly high tolerance to heat of the Scoville variety but I do appreciate a dish that can make me sweat, especially when the heat accentuates the flavor as good Thai food often does. I mistakenly backed down from my 3 stars and she said she'd bring me 2.5.The dish arrived and I didn't even think about how bland it was spice-wise as I asked my companion why something with garlic in its title would not have a hint of garlic flavor. It was only after 4 or 5 bites that I realized I wasn't going to need a second napkin to dab my forehead. This was some bland pork atop lettuce, accented by what appeared to be red pepper flakes. Alas, the spring rolls were good.I appreciate the woman looking out for my tongue, but if this is what passed for almost 3 star spicy I might have to stick to making my own. I'll hope this was an aberration and probably give 'em another shot, but I'm going in like Tom Petty. I won't back down.***Update: I went back and ordered some kind of seafood curry that was very good and pushing my heat limits as I finished the bowl. They've earned a third star. Great thai food and naughty art on the walls too! &#160;We were sitting under a picture of well, we weren't sure, and when our waiter noticed all three of us transfixed on the landscape of bodies tumbling over one another and some kind of rope thing going on, he goes, "ohhh! &#160;That one's kind of naughty!" &#160;Half dressed tug of war/orgy is what we all finally decided on. &#160;So entertaining.Anyway, so - the food. &#160;Love the Lard Nar, described only as having broccoli, tofu, and 'delicious sauce' (I'd say it's more like gravy... yum!), the fresh rolls, and all of their soups. &#160;The small soup size is huge! &#160;I've never seen the large but imagine it could serve 6. &#160;The hotness factor is high here. &#160;I am a medium spice kinda girl, but was hungover last trip and got one star only. &#160;It was still really hot but it hurt so good and actually cured my hangover. &#160;Prices are totally reasonable. &#160;Apparently the naughty art is for free! I eat here about 3 times a week. &#160;Seriously, it's up the street from my house. &#160;And why cook when you can get fabulous Thai food with friendly service? &#160;Thai Siam is casual and homey, with quirky touches like mismatched plates, a statue holding a dish of Mike &amp; Ikes by the register, and cool costumed dolls at every window. &#160;Every time I visit, I try something new. &#160;I've only been disappointed twice, due to personal tastes. &#160;So f ar my favorites were the lemongrass chicken, chicken delight, and tom kah gai. &#160;Their menu is so vast that I haven't repeated a single dish yet... and I still haven't had to order pad thai. &#160;Amazing. &#160;And, you MUST save room for the desserts! &#160;The mangoes with sticky rice is simple, yet to die for! Not my most favorite Thai food restaurant in Seattle, but a close second. Thai Siam has excellent food, quick service, and affordable prices.Parking is decent, but the booths are a tight squeeze. Also, it might be a good idea to make reservations if you're with a large group of people (over 4 people).I recommend getting a few different dishes and sharing. My favorites? The chicken satay appetizer and Phad see iew. Yum!
I usually never go out for Chinese food because it's usually not very good/Americanized. I guess I'm kind of a mama's boy since I love my mom's cooking and have become snobby about it.Anyway, the point here is that Chiang's serves the real deal. The food is authentic Chinese. They cover all styles from Taiwanese to dishes from the mainland. Funny thing is that there are two menus, one for those who can read Chinese and one for those who can not (English menu). I'd suggest you go with somebody who can order from the "expanded" version or have your waiter/waitress do it for you. You'll have a better meal.Good luck! Five-star, authentic Chinese food in this unassuming restaurant right off Lake City Way NE. This is the best Chinese food I've had in Seattle yet, and is highly recommended if you want to get away from the bland, Westernized Chinese food that abounds elsewhere.Ask for the traditional menu for some of &#160;the more unsual items. It has &#160;English names for the dishes and Mabel "Sexy Li", the manager, was very friendly and suggested several things to try. HIghlights for me were the Shanghai noodles with tofu, vegetarian "spare ribs", and shrimp fried rice. Wicked-looking spicy fried chicken was wolfed down by the carnivores at our table. Hot, salty soy milk and a hotpot with pig's intestine were the strangest items others tried, and looked good.
I am impressed by this dark little space. I usually use Yelp but I stumbled upon this joint on a different app and am so happy I tried it out not knowing anything about it, but that it had a new killer happy hour. My boyfriend and I went in and got a seat at the bar, the place had only a handful of people in it. It's super dark romantic lighting (a little brighter at the bar top) but it &#160;makes for a great date! They had a long list of signature cocktails, but I hadn't drank a Manhattan in a minute and I was feeling fancy plus.. it was only like 8$. It was SO delicious! The bar tender definitely knew what he was doing. From a long day of shopping the boyfriend and I had worked up quite an appetite and got a full taste of many different things from this menu, here it goes! (I'll make this easy) Caesar Salad: This is a REAL Caesar, sardine fish across the top of the bed and all. The dressing was good. And i'm a Caesar connoisseur so that's saying a lot. Shrimp Tacos: Corn tortilla was a little rough - didn't keep all the ingredients in, but the shrimp alone was citrus and tasty. Margarita Pizza: mmmm my favorite. Fluffy crust, oozing cheese and plenty of basil and tomatoes. They did a fantastic job on this dish. Feta Fries with Truffle Oil and a Garlic Aoilo. Need I say more? With all that food - plus a cocktail and a beer, we spent less than 40$ and were perfectly full and satisfied. I highly recommend this place! Everytime I come here I looks so cool inside I wonder why I don't come more often. The lights are cool, nice music, the menu looks yummy. About a year ago I came in for a drink. i sat down and the bartender never came over. I assumed i needed to go up and order it so I did. then as I sat Iat the bar I watched him serve other people. Maybe I was to eager. He never came over to see if i wanted another drink. I eventually had to interupt him, walk over and ask for another drink.Last week i came in and sat at the ba and we ordered drinks. They came pretty fast. We drank our drinks and then tried ot flag down the bartender to get more. He litterly walked by us twice without asking if we needed more drinks. He wasn't busy. &#160; We waved our arms, we tried to get his attention. Nothing. Eventually we got his atention about an hour later after the last of us had finished our drink. We finally got his attention and asked for our tab. Our drinks were $8 apeice. Perhaps at the Happy hour price it owuld be acceptable servie but then at a drink an hour I'm not sure its worth it. I've decided i can't go here If I want to eat or drink. Therefore I'm not sure why it exsists. I feel like this happens almost everytime I go. &#160;It would probably be more efficient if i brought my own booze here and I'm pretty sure the bartender wouldn't notice or care. This place is very quaint. The food was good as was the service. Tried it out because we couldn't get in next door, I was very happy with the decision. There is a lack of insulation in the building though so dress warm or look for one of their space heaters. Went to Mona's last Saturday because some musician friends were playing a semi-private gig. &#160;The music was 5-stars but everything about Mona's was exactly as bad as it was from the last time I was there almost a year ago and this included:*Dirty glasses/tableware*Surly service*They ran out of IPA and had no replacement*They had no top-shelf bourbon (Makers, Bulleit etc.)The sight of dirty silver was enough to make me not want to order any food and I had to go next door (to the Latona Pub) for a decent drink. &#160;This is a "bistro"? Went for drinks and appetizers and it was alright, &#160;Drinks were at least good and somewhat worth it. Let me start off by saying that the atmosphere was great. It's cute, trendy, easy to find, very "loungy" and close to the University District which is always a plus among my friends and I. It seemed like a perfect location for post graduation reunion for my friends and I. That being said, I wish it was a more enjoyable experience. First off, it took forever for our server to take our order. Not only this, when he did, he seemed very rushed and eager to get it and get out. Almost borderline "I need to move onto the next table" mentality. On top of this, he starts off by saying, "this is what we donthave on the menu" which comprised of literally HALF of the menu. The pizzas, the lamb sliders, and the orzo were gone. Which was a severe dissapointment cause thats what my friends and I were hoping to order. Other substutions were made but it still put a damper to the evening. It would have been better if he had let us know of this when he first greeted us. We appreciated the fact that they offered us complimentary "lemon drops" for the lack of food options, but the time he did, none of us wanted to even consider a drink.Also, regarding the billing. He charged my friends card for the wrong item TWICE. It was a split check and we had directly told him what items to charge to each card presented. Despite this, he managed to screw up twice, prolonging getting our final bill by 15-20 minutes.The food overall was fine. There was nothing special about the arugula salad and baked brie that I ordered. My friend commented that her seafood pasta was drenched in oil and felt very heavy after eating it. It was edible and we left content. For any people considering going, I'd suggest go elsewhere if you want something special in terms of a meal. One more thing, I personally find hygiene very important. To our server, if you think we didnt see the "snot" drooling down your nose and you sucking it back up, we did. Actually 3 out of the 5 girls had direct view of it coming down and being pulled back up. It was quite the site to see and made our appetites go down significantly. Clearly you had a cold so perhaps you should have stayed at home instead of working. This was clearly your off night which I understand. Nonetheless, I will not be returning nor suggesting this establishment to other people. We can get the same food, same vibe somewhere else. Nice ambience, music was not too loud as in a lot of restaurants of this type. &#160;Ordered two lamb burgers and waited a very long time before they were served. &#160;Probably at least 8 oz. of lamb on a large bun with some white sauce and lettuce, also a small salad of lettuce and tomatoes - all very good.The service left a little to be desired. &#160;After we were served our meal, the waiter never came back to check on us, or even made eye contact. &#160;Was trying to catch his eye to get some salt and pepper, and ended up going to the bar and asking the bartender. &#160;After we were finished with our meal, we still couldn't catch the eye of our waiter after waiting quite a long time, so got up again and asked another waiter to get our check. &#160;Our waiter did finally bring our check. The food is nothing amazing, but I'm a sucker for the moodlighting and wine selection. Good place to catch up with a friend over a glass of red and maybe have a dessert. A groupon deal lured me to Mona's. Came here last night with my husband and after reading reviews on yelp, I didn't have high expectation for this place in regards to food. &#160;We started our meal with baked brie as our appetizer followed by our dinner entree, which I ordered the braised pork shoulder and my husband &#160;had the roasted chicken. The baked brie wasn't bad, but we both felt the brie was a bit cold. It took awhile for our entrees to be served and when it did arrived our proteins were both luke warm. &#160;I left the sauce that was used for the braised shoulder were overly salty and the meat was dry. When I tried my husband's chicken we both agreed the chicken was overly dry too, even the drumstick was dry. How can a chicken drumstick be that dry? Overall, the meals weren't good but just mediocre. My husband ordered a drink and he said it was pretty good and strong, which it better be since it was $8.50 for it. Probably wouldn't go back to pay full price unless there was a groupon deal of some sort.
I've been going here for years and often. &#160;I heard they have a new Chef and it shows! I just sunk my teeth into a $5 Happy Hour Lamb Slider that was probably the best burger I've ever tasted. &#160;Whatever changes have been made keep it up! &#160;We will be back and trying more.UPDATE: &#160;The new Roasted Chicken dish with asparagus and mashed potatoes on the menu is $16, big enough to split and DELICIOUS!!!! My hubby and I drove all the way down here from Vancouver, BC with our Livingsocial voucher, and we are glad we did!! This place is the kind of restaurant we wished we had in Vancouver. &#160;Located in the northern part of Seattle and right off the I-5 it was an easy drive for us after some shopping in Lynnwood. &#160;We made our reservations online via OpenTable and were greeted by the bartender and seated very promptly. &#160;The place was warm, roomy, and very cosy on a rainy, winter night!We managed to find street parking (very residential area). &#160;We had $50 to burn and it got us plenty of food. &#160;Lamb Sliders, Brie appy, shrimp tacos, orzo with shrimp, and sausage pizza. &#160;The portions were so large that we had a ton of food packed to go (in recycled paper containers to boot). &#160;I did have a glass of riesling, and it wasn't that good, but I will let it slide.Our server worked really hard, and it appeared it was only him and the bartender. &#160;The food tasted FANTASTIC, and the hubby and I are already talking about our next trip down south--they have Happy Hour!! Went out on a Friday night to watch the band Karimina play at Mona's. My wife and I split the Warm Pita, the Mac &amp; Cheese (with added sausage) and the Lamb Bolognese. The food was good but not great, with the feta spread for the pita and the mac and cheese being the best of what we ordered. While the spicy feta spread for the pita was excellent, the hummus was surprisingly bland. The mac and cheese was very flavorful, but also very rich and served in a very large portion, impossible for one person (or perhaps even two) to finish it at the table. The cheese sauce used was very rich...almost as if they started with Alfredo sauce and added a lot of cheese to it. The Lamb Bolognese, however, was rather disappointing as it's flavors did not go well together at all.I liked the decor...lots of vibrant reds used around the restaurant. The acoustics for watching a live performance were decent, although the bar in the middle of the restaurant blocks the view from about half the seats. The waitstaff were friendly, albeit very confused - getting a full set of silverware proved to be a challenge. We started with one set missing, and the extra we asked for was missing a knife. After the appetizer they took the silverware away, leaving us to ask for another two sets, one of which was also short a knife. One thing I noticed from my last trip here was the new menu. A friend and I started out with the roasted olives which are warm and delicious. They are the perfect snack to pair with your first drink while you wait for your food to arrive. The second thing we got was the roasted red and beat salad. As a recent beat lover this salad didn't disappoint. It was fresh and the portion was perfect. The next thing we got was the lamb sliders off of the HH menu. They were delicious, but I wish the buns were a little fancier. If the sliders had been made with buns from a local bakery they would have been perfect. Along with the burgers we got the truffle fries. Talk about addicting. We had a friend who arrived late and ordered the Lamb Bolognese. I got a couple bites and the sauce was amazing. I will definitely get that the next time I go. Throughout the night the bartender was super attentive. He even made us a special drink that went perfectly with the spice from the lamb sliders.Overall the experience was good. The food was great and the bartender was awesome. I came here tonight to hear Karmina and didn't really care much about &#160;the food. Thank god for that because it was really nothing special. (Karmina on the other hand was awesome!)Food: 2 starsWarm pita Appetizer - This was quite good. It comes with a feta cheese spread that is quite good and the hummus is decent. Mac and Cheese - an enormous portion of decent mac and cheese. It's very heavy and seems to have a generic seasoning/alfredo blend in it but it also has a lot cheese so it fulfills the ooey gooey need that only mac and cheese can fill. I would recommend sharing this between several people as it is quite heavy.Lamb Bolognese - Very poor quality ground lamb, so poor it tasted like poor quality ground beef. The noodles were undercooked and the whole dish was very dry. This is definitely an item I would pass on. I would order hamburger helper instead of this if they offered it on the menu.Tea- OK I know you don't come here for tea but on the off chance you want to order some, know they do have green tea. It's crappy and in a bag, but they have it.Service:4 starThe servers were very nice and went out of their way to make sure we had a good experience. It did seem as if the wait team didn't communicate too well sometimes, but they were very nice, which more than made up for asking for silverware, not getting a knife and having to ask again. Atmosphere: 3.5 starsIt is a bit too dark in here and the music is a bit too loud, except the band we came to hear, which wasn't loud enough. &#160;Other reviews talk about how it's a bit confused and I must agree. There doesn't seem to be a cohesive idea of what this place is supposed to be... and I like that about it. It has a vampire bar, meets fancy restaurant, meets night club vibe that I found quirky and endearing. Overall I will not be driving to Green Lake for the food here, but if they have a band playing that I like, I would look forward to going; endearing. Overall I will not be driving to Green Lake for the food here, but if they have a band playing that I like, I would look forward to going, I would just order something different. This is a pretty cool lounge, a little off the beaten path near Greenlake. I imagine this is a popular weekend spot for the local residents as it's on the edge of a neighborhood. My wife and I came here for a date night given we had purchased a certificate from a daily deals site. The lounge has the feel of a jazz club, but they do pay homage to The Beatles. You'll know it when you see it. Two appetizers and two entrees for $47 pre-discount and tip, so they are priced reasonably enough. I had ordered the lamb burger, and while flavorful, it was slightly dry. I'd opt for medium-rare next time. My wife had their mac and cheese, which should probably have been labeled cheese and mac given the amount of glorious cheese in the dish. It was without breadcrumbs as I'm come accustomed to when ordering that dish in restaurants, and it did need a little salt to enhance the flavor. What stood out were the appetizers. The owner/chef has a taste for cured pork products, as do I, so I was delighted to see five items on their menu featured either pancetta or prosciutto. One being their Caesar Brussels Sprouts. An amalgamation of brussels sprouts, cheese, and prosciutto all cooked in caesar salad dressing. When my wife and I enjoy a restaurant, and we're deciding on what makes it a five star versus a four star, it's if we're willing to drive out of our way to come back. This amazing dish almost edged this restaurant to five star status. What kept it back was a) difficulty in finding parking and b) lack of an espresso machine. It's a lounge in Seattle, where's the gourmet coffee? BF and I went here to use a LivingSocial deal and try a new place. We were pretty much the only people there since there was a torrential downpour outside. Service was decent, food was good. They brought my meal first and my BF's food didn't come for another 10 minutes or so, when I was halfway done (luckily he is a fast eater and I am slow). There was some sort of miscommunication that they thought my meal was the appetizer and his was the main? Not really sure because we made it pretty clear that we each ordered our own meals. They didn't offer anything to make up for the mistake. i want to give this place a better rating, as i like the location, owner and music scene here. &#160;however, there was 1 waitress for over 20 tables--the whole restaurant, and it took 15 minutes to give her our wine order. &#160;she told us she would be right back, and then 30-35 minutes later, comes by and says, 'gee, did i forget to take your order?' in that time, they ran out of the special that i wanted to order, and the waitress didn't offer us a free drink or app. after she dropped the ball and totally forgot about us---she didn't even try to make it up to us in any way, kind of a 'well, i don't care' and 'sucks for you'' attitude. &#160;with entrees that are $18, that just didn't fly with us. &#160;what was worse than that was the lack of heat on a cold Seattle night. &#160;they should not have even had the place open as everyone was eating in their jackets and there was no heat. &#160;Mona's--you guys need to really step it up in SERVICE if you want to earn your customer's business. &#160;this was very frustrating for us as we wanted to like the place and enjoy a good meal, but we were left with a bad experience. &#160;i suggest going there just for drinks and sitting at the bar.... I was a little annoyed because I showed up at happy hour and they didn't even tell me that it was happy hour. I feel like they were trying to take advantage and not give me a happy hour deal. Besides that, the food was good and the drinks were strong. Hopefully you can get there on a slow night when you can actually get service &#160;in a reasonable amount of time. It took us about 20 minutes to close out our tab. Bummer because we've been here before and it was awesome. Management needs to add more servers! Not impressed! By the way, their living social deal is not good for happy hour even though it doesn't mention that anywhere in the coupon. Go next door to LATONA!! Way better! Love this place for date night. The place was pretty full with couples last night, tons of shrimp in the risotto, the bartender was quick and made some good drinks. The music has changed and is more upbeat. I like it. Food was mediocre at best. &#160;Flatbread was disappointing, and so was the salad. &#160;The bartender saved the day - made a great Gin cocktail! Stopped here late one Saturday night. &#160;Love the ambiance inside. &#160;Very small, and intimate. &#160;Had the brussel sprouts which were amazing. &#160;Lamb bolognese which came recommended was only okay. &#160;If it had been better, I would have given Mona's 5 stars. &#160;Very attentive service JAZZZZZZZZZZZZYYYYYYYY!! don't be square - it's a wonderful place to have a few drinks and listen to live music! &#160;can't say the food is amazing or anything but hey.. if live music makes you shake your shoulders or wiggle.. whatever. &#160;great place! This is a cozy, dark, and enjoyable spot, tucked away in Greenlake. I went on a Saturday recently and had a lovely evening. Both the bartenders were fantastic, and each made me a great drink, coupled with friendliness and humor. I only ate small bites, and they were nothing to write home about, but they were good and tasty and what you would expect from a happy hour. My partner had a good time and remarked about how fast and prompt the service and bussing was. Bravo. I would recommend bringing a date here for a romantic time or to saddle up at the bar for good drinks and convo with the bartenders. Will be back! This was my first time at Mona's Bistro &amp; Lounge, and I was very pleasantly surprised. A couple of months ago, Urban Dealight had an offer for $19 you get $45 worth of food and drink. I bought it and me and my DH decided to go tonight. I had the roasted beet salad with goat cheese and pomegranate reduction and my husband had the arugula salad. The beets were delicious--cold and roasted perfectly. For my entree, I had the caprese flat bread, kind of a pizza with cheese, basil, plum tomatoes and a drizzle of this amazing sauce. Hubby had the braised short ribs and mashed potatoes. I had a bite and it was delicious--just slightly on the salty side but very tender, and it was also a generous serving. The ambiance is nice: casual, romantic and not overly fussy. Service was very friendly and prompt, even though it appeared that just one person was handling all of the tables. This is definitely on the "return to" list. I love this place! A trendy neighborhood bar. It seems a little chic from the outside, but the staff and clientele are very friendly and down to earth. I'll be coming back! First off, don't look at their website because it's apparently outdated. &#160;I saw on it that they would have $4 glasses of champagne on Thursdays and when I asked if they would honor the price on the website the waitress just bluntly said no. &#160;Also it took an hour to get our food and the waitress barely came to the table. &#160;We ordered an appetizer and she brought it our entrees all at the same time! &#160;I don't recommend this place to anyone! I enjoyed a cocktail at Mona's with a friend, and it was quite tasty. &#160;Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to try any of the food so I will definitely have to go back. &#160;The atmosphere is nice and cozy and a great place for socializing.
This is an OK alternative to the Latona Pub next door, since they are actually open earlier than 4:30 on Mondays and Tuesdays. Plus they have a much better happy hour: $3 brews, cheap appetizers. But they were out of Manny's and the ratio of pita to hummus was far too low. What, am I supposed to eat the rest of the hummus with a spoon?When we got there, they had the door propped open to take care of some sort of odor (didn't ask), which made it about 12 degrees in there. Even after they closed it, I had to keep my parka on the whole time we were there. This place has potential, but I'm not a total convert. upscale, but casual at the same time... both classy and a little funky.... and the price is definitely right. &#160;the lighting and decor gives the place a vibrant, swanky vibe, but everyone there is pretty chill and not pretentious at all...more like a neighborhood hangout. &#160;i tried the food for the first time, and it was excellent with even better prices. &#160;the calamari was superb! (and its hard for me to say that about calamari)its a good place to sit by yourself at the bar (although i bet you'll make some friends quickly) or to go with a group of pals or on a date. &#160;oh, and the bartender Jesse rocks! Great place to share a bunch of appetizers with friends. The entrees looked good too, but the selection of little nibbles was too tempting to resist. We enjoyed antipasto, grape leaves and tyropita, lamb sliders, black bean burger sliders with avocado, brie drizzled with lavender honey, and a yummy dessert. On a warm night, happy hour is perfect sitting by the open window with the breeze flowing in and the neighborhood dogwalkers and commuters passing by.Quite a bargain if you download the $25 gift certificate from http://restaurant.com (for $1!!) and take advantage of 1/2 price wine night on Tuesdays. All bottles below $50 are on the 1/2 price list, not just the stuff that they really want to move, so you can pick exactly what you want. Wonderful drinks and great food. &#160;I love seeing the rotating and creative drink menu. &#160;The early happy hour &#160;is great (5-7 everyday)- 1/2 &#160;off all food! &#160;Food is fresh and tasty. &#160;The potatoes are simple, cheap and delicious. &#160;My husband always orders mint julips and says that they are the best in town (made with Bookers if you request). &#160;Nice, friendly &#160;romantic vibe with lots of candle light and red painted walls. &#160;After 9, it is either live music or loud dj which is fine but makes it harder to converse. A Sunday evening two girlfriends and I decided to make it out for an early dinner. We first tried to roll by the Scarlet Tree (a whole other review for that...) but when we were sure that wouldn't work we stopped by Mona's. Krittika next door is a regular Thai place for us, and we'd see this place a million times without going in. We were pretty excited, and I was a bit disappointed. Like most yelpers, I really want the ability to .5 star this, it would be a 2.5 star, but I figured I'd round up. So here is the meat: joyfully there is a happy hour from 4-7pm everyday. We were in that window so we got a great deal for lots of food. We got a few $5 apps and a few $6. I got black bean sliders with avocado and chipotle mayo. They were good, but the burger itself was quite dry, which was a bummer. My gals both got the baja shrimp tacos and they consisted of three tacos, two shrimp each with some soft coleslaw seemingly thoughtlessly dropped on the soft taco. I liked that it seemed that the menu was pretty mailable. The waitress told us of a few substitutions in that day, and one: chicken for sausage on mini pizzas, made my friends pretty happy as they don't really love sausage. The ambiance was nice, could be very romantic or casual depending on your outlook. What was not great was the wait time to get a menu, let alone the wait time for the food itself. We'll probably give it a try again due to its nice proximity to work, but otherwise, you'd do better with a lovely burger at Latona, or some curry from Krittika. I want to love this place.....really I do. &#160;Its close to home, it has nice ambiance, and is a great place for a date. &#160;One thing is lacking however........THE SERVICE. &#160;Twice in the last two weeks the service has been painfully slow. &#160;Last night, I had it. &#160;I had ordered a drink and it took 15 min to get it AND was made wrong. &#160; I ordered another drink 45 min later, &#160;but this time it never came. &#160;We ended up moving to the bar just to get better service, and even that was slow! &#160; gah I think the key to Mona's is nighttime. I went around 6:30pm to use my http://Restaurant.com GC and Mona's was abandoned. We saw the sticker on the door saying Mona's was Seattle's most romantic restaurant in 2007 - is this true? I don't know if that's for real.5 stars for the food, 1 star for the service. Our meatball appetizer and my boyfriend's short ribs and mashed potatoes were hot and tasty. Unfortunately he had to eat them alone as the kitchen corrected my order - they'd brought out the wrong type of pasta at first. Then the waitress forgot my drink and I had to remind her. Her excuse for both mistakes was that she couldn't hear me ... (over the noise of the 2 people across the room?) I hoped to write a better review, but that's not possible. The service was good, but the food was just OK. &#160;I ordered gorgonzola penne with walnuts, red peppers, and prosciutto. &#160;What I got was A LOT of penne in a cream sauce, TWO red pepper strips, and a handful of square cuts of the fat part of bacon. &#160;My husband got lamb bolognese, which was nothing special (very little sauce compared to the mound of fettuccine--not pappardelle as advertised). &#160;I could have made better at home. Though only a few blocks from my place, I had only gone to Mona's 2 times before the other night. &#160;When you walk in there is a sign that reads "please wait to be seated" and so I waited for a couple minutes while 3 or 4 different workers looked over at me and my girlfiend, and did nothing. &#160;Finally the bartender told us to just find a seat. &#160;One thing that annoys the hell out of me is when a place has a sign instructing you to wait but has people just sit wherever. &#160;How am I supposed to know that I can just sit anywhere? &#160;After sitting down it took no time at all for a couple glasses of water to be put in front of us but it did take quite some time to get menus, which were almost impossible to read. &#160;I understand the whole low light thing they have going, I actually enjoy the type of mood that it gives, but I think that making a drink list that is in small black print over soft gold paper is a ridiculously poor decision by management. &#160;The food menu was almost as bad. &#160;I had to get my cellphone out and use its backlight to see what I wanted to order.I ended up having a waiter who was training a new employee. &#160;They were nice and gave okay service... &#160;Actually, with one of them training I think I should say that it was good service not just okay. &#160;Seriously, everyone has to have a learning curve, right? &#160;The food wasn't exceptional. &#160;I had the chicken panini sandwich and cesar salad. &#160;The sandwich was okay and the cesar had no flavor. &#160;I was poured a larger than normal glass of wine which was great, but that could have just been my new server not knowing the bar's regular amount. &#160;The cost was about average for this kind of place in Seattle. &#160;Not too excessive but more than it should be.Live music was playing in the front corner. &#160;It was fairly loud because of the size of the place but the band was good and it was a Saturday so who can really complain about &#160; music in a bar?All things considered, the place just seems very average overall. &#160;Not bad, not great. &#160;I'll go back but mostly because it's in my neighborhood. What a lovely place.Quiet, dark, great menu of appetizers - which are priced well at Happy Hour - and delicious drinks.Go there for a romantic rendevoux or a chatty girls night. A http://Restaurant.com gift certificate brought my girlfriend and I here. &#160;We were not disappointed. &#160;This place is great. &#160;The food and beverage choices were awesome and very reasonably priced. &#160;Even without the gift certificate, our meal here would have been inexpensive but with the certificate - downright cheap! &#160;Our server was very friendly and nice.After our meal, I went home and bought two more certificates - we will be back! Went there to use $25 gift certificate from http://Restaurant.com with my bestfriend.Ordered::: Warm Calamari Bruschetta, Lamb Bolognese and Stuffed Pork Chop. &#160;So much flavor and perfect seasoning for everything!bruschetta was a little unique since i usually had cold/shrimpy ones before. I especially liked the bolognese - so meaty! &#160;Stuffed Pork Chop was somewhat overwhelming and was cooked unevenly - some part was soo dry and some was blooooody.I liked the atmosphere and I would like to try the happy hour next time.=) I was a huge fan when my girlfriend and her hubby owned this restaurant so I was reluctant in making another appearance. They have happy hour 7 days a week from 5 to 7pm I was delightfully surprised. Mona's is a classy restaurant. Their location is right on Latona. Parking can be tricky if it is a hot sunny afternoon. You compete with Greenlake walkers so get their early. Their food is very good. The portions are generous. I got the calamari bruschetta which was sooooo good. They have a variety of starters lamb sliders, roasted potatoes, bake brie, grilled shrimp, Spanish meatballs. OK now I am getting hungry. The bartender was so nice, very engaging. He knew the menu well and was prompt with service. This place is not pretentious and a fun way to spend an evening.They also have a calendar of events for live music etc.
One of the best happy hours in Seattle. (there actually 2 happy hours here) $4 &#160;food menu, great margaritas and nice atmosphere, without being pretentious. I understand people who reference belltown when talking about Matador, but it still has a neighborhood vibe and you'll find people of all ages here. Long after all the "Hip" belltown joints have come &amp; gone, Matador will still be going strong! I'm a little mixed on this place actually. &#160;When I first got into this place I was impressed with the decor. &#160;On a Friday night it was certainly packed... we waited by the fire until I thought I was going to spontaneously combust... luckily we got a table eventually. &#160;The hostess was pretty cool, but our waitress... not so much. &#160;The nachos were pretty good, but when our carne asada tacos arrived and we were unsuccessful in locating the meat they were reported to contain, we were informed by the waitress that she couldn't control the amount of meat the kitchen put in the tacos. &#160;Hmm. &#160;No attempt on her part to do anything. &#160;In comparison to the carne asada tacos I devour quite frequently at El Camino, these were vastly disappointing. &#160;Not only did they barely contain any meat, but the flavor wasn't all the impressive. &#160;The saving grace to a one or two star review was the Banana Crown (I believe that was what it was called) dessert, that was amazing. &#160;There actually wasn't much banana in it, but it was so good I completely forgot about it. &#160;Would I go back? &#160;Yeah I'd give it another shot, but avoid the tacos. I think I've tried to hit Matador on at least 10 different occasions, and have only made it in twice due to the crowds. &#160;It is what it is - nice but very busy atmosphere, and decent Tex-Mex food with nice Margaritas. &#160;The big turnoff for me is the cramped feeling, although if you're looking to cop a feel or two without getting caught, I suppose this could work to your advantage. Ballard is the new Kirkland. :-) That's what my friend said anyway. Actually this place would fit right in on the Kirkland waterfront. There's a distinctly young hipster crowd (or whatever the cool kids call it now days), upscale modern decor. I really liked the inlaid wood pattern in the bar. My one gripe was the couple making out behind my friend... but it's a bar, so what do you want? Also, they have a fireplace that's just far enough away from the bar to warm you slightly, but not overheat. It felt good after being in the rain.If I were going on those things alone, it would get a 5, but the food is pretty average. &#160;I got the red chile enchiladas with swine and I didn't find it spicy as other people said, but I have a pretty high hotness tolerance... you need that when you sit at a bar full of hotties. The portions were pretty large, but I found myself picking at the plate. I don't know if I was just distracted by conversation or what. Anyway I REALLY didn't like the bland generic Mexican rice, but I appreciated having black beans instead of refried. Apparently the guac had some heat to it too. My friend's face turned bright red on one bite. No such luck for me.Our bartender reminded me of one of those guys in the college bar scene. I don't know how else to describe it. I prefer the kind that have been at a place for like 100 years and do it for the love of the beer. That kind of character was missing in "Ray". The one drink of his I tried was pretty average.Parking was pretty hard to find for a Monday night... about 15-20 minutes and 6 or so blocks away, but the return walk was pleasant since I had someone to talk to and there's a lot of stuff to look at on Ballard Ave. I would not hesitate to hit the Matador again, especially at happy hour, but there's so much other interesting stuff around that I'd most likely not get back to it for quite some time on my own. It can get loud at times during the popular happy hour.I hate the lighting, so dim that I can't even see what I am eating or how cute my date is.Nice accommodating servers and staff, always willing to serve the customer.Tortilla soup was a total disappoint, so were the wings.Good enchiladas and nachos. Love this place. The happy hour menu is great. Lots of great food and discounted drinks. You cant go wrong. I've never gotten a bad meal or drink here. The only down side is it can get real busy especially on a Friday or Saturday night. Bob Marley blasting very loudly on the stereo. Lots of women with long hair and cleavage tossing back their hair and giggling. If I didn't know better, I'd think Abercrombie paid for product placement here. But the reason I was brought to this den of sorrow is because the $4 happy hour resumes from 11pm-1am, and I was both low on cash and hungry. I had the spring rolls and nachos and both were reasonably tasty. Still, I can't see myself happily whiling away the hours in this place under other circumstances. I giggled when the waitress asked "Want some more cho's?" in reference to the nachos 'cause initially it sounded like chode, and that seemed more appropriate. Que Suerte!We ate here on Halloween and had a b l a s t.A freaky, huge mariachi band piled in and filled the entire restaurant and rocked the party. The staff was dressed up and the food was good south-west Mexican-American food.The band was from La Carta de Oaxaca I think. I dont see why thet get all the hype, but theyre good. Everytime I go I usually have one small plate and one beer or cocktail and I'm ready to go. Its not really worth my trip to ballard, but if youre around the area and hungry or need to quench your thirst, stop by. Like our local Matador, happy hour is great.However, while I agree that the Habanero Enchiladas are pretty hot, the quality of the dish as a whole is low. Also, some of my chips were stale.My buddy who had the pulled pork sandwich was extremely unimpressed.Last night the girls got nachos and the plates were cleaned, so that must say something. Matador is the best deal at happy hour -- that's from 4-6p, or after 10p. They have a selection of awesome food for $4 (shrimp quesadilla, nachos, tortilla soup, etc). The tamarindo is one fine-ass cocktail too.I won't speak to the atmosphere as I'm not single and looking to hook up... but the word on the (Ballard) Ave is that it's a pretty good place if you're into that sorta thing... I was impressed with Matador's ability to create an upscale Tex-Mex restaurant. &#160;The restaurant is good, no doubt about it; not amazing, but good. &#160;I thought the Red Chile Enchiladas were pretty tasty, though not spicy enough for my taste. &#160;The bar deserves its own comments; it is sectioned off from the main eating area and is definitely on the trendy side. &#160;I'm not quite sure why, but Matador seems to attract an overabundance of men. &#160;If the bar wasn't quite so crowded, it would be awesome, especially the open fireplace which is great when it is chilly outside. Prior to my recent outing, I've been here once before - sat outside during the summer having dinner with friends. &#160;The waitress was kind and constantly refilled our drinks, chips and salsa. &#160;The food was flavorful - enchiladas had a kick and the steak nachos were enough for me to want to go back. &#160;The place gets real crowded and since it's dark inside, it took me a while to get around people as I looked for the bathroom. &#160;Recently had happy hour here with some friends. &#160;Although we got here fairly early I was surprised at how unattentive the staff was. &#160;We had to waive someone down to order our food and drinks. &#160;Luckily for them, the food compensated for their lack of service. &#160;We ordered the nachos, chicken soft tacos and spicy calamari. &#160;The servings were plenty to satisfy four hungry people who left work early to enjoy happy hour prices at $4/dish. &#160;;) &#160;Priorities... I know! &#160;haha. I am basing my review on the food and not the atmosphere...aka as sausage fest/sword fight that happens over any half decent woman who comes into this pickup joint.The food is great, and the happy hour is fantastic. &#160;I believe my wife and I were drinking Sangria the day we accidently conceived a child. &#160;So beware.If people are basing their reviews on a nightspot, and you go there after 9pm...you get what you get. &#160;For similar reviews from people who expect more out of pickup joints see: &#160;Peso's, Paragon...and many other places I dont venture.If you get a chance to eat there do. Really hot food... and I mean hella spicey. &#160;I enjoy heat, but it's a bit much for my wife which kind of limits how often we go. &#160;If they just didn't put that chile oil on everything (or off to the side) it would be better.Hot crowd too. &#160;Ballard meat market? I don't know, but it does make Matador pretty busy.The best part is the late night happy hour and well stocked tequila list. &#160;I've got to try that $85 shot of Don Julio Real some day. &#160;They used to have some $110 shot, but apparently it's no longer available...
I recently changed work locations to Northgate Mall and was excited to see Thai Go and Noodle Zone In the food court, as both their Westlake Center locations serve excellent noodle dishes cooked to order. Their food is truly better than its food court existence. When I finally visited, it was the down period between lunch and dinner - about 3pm. There were two cashiers on and two cooks manning the woks, and nobody in line ahead of me. Despite all this, over 15 minutes elapsed from the time I ordered until the time I was served. It seems they were more interested in filling the hotel pans in their row of steam tables for the non-existent line of customers waiting for their warmed-over "specials" than they were in preparing fresh food for a cash customer. What I received bore little resemblance to the vermicelli noodles with chicken I'd ordered many times at the Westlake Noodle Zone. Instead of a spicy melange of chicken, green onions, egg tossed with panfried vermicelli noodles, I got a steaming knotted glob of noodles, surrounded by indistinguishably beige chunks of chicken? egg? and vegetables?I'd rather eat Panda Express (6 stalls away) than... this. Seriously.
The Baranof is the adult equivalent of sitting cross-legged in front of the TV, eating cereal while wearing footie pajamas. It's just comfortable, welcoming and simple in the most fundamental of ways. Want a Jello Shot? They've got you covered with two flavors. Margarita, and Red. Just red. Like a Jolly Rancher. Want a smoke? Step out on the back patio. Need a beer? Easy Peasy. Need something a little stronger? They will make sure that you are in fine form before Karaoke starts up on stage. If I can get them to include Schoolhouse Rock in the Jukebox you might just see me in the aforementioned outfit and pose on a weekend morning singing...Conjunction Junction...what's your function....It's that kind of a place. I NEED some more Baranof in my life!!My sister Jackie and I came here with many fellow Yelpers (Katy, Peter, Matt, Jamie, Heidi "Yelp Nasty", Ian, Aaron, Jake, etc etc had great tables in the karaoke room -- yes I'm a name-dropper) for an "informal" event. &#160;It was a great time, complete with strong drinks and good company.Walking in, it seemed rather low-key but still bustling at the early hour of 9:00pm, so we mingled and even sang a little karaoke. &#160;After humming the whole song to Jackie so she was "SURE she knows it", we busted out a little MJ - "The Way You Make Me Feel". &#160;It was a friendly crowd and some even braved the dance floor (I'm looking at you, Todd B).The bar food looked scrumptious (particularly the french fries) but there were only about 5-7 choices to select from. &#160;On par with the laid-back vibe, though. &#160;When we were ready to leave, I closed my tab (written on a post-it). &#160;I love how the bartender (owner??) asked me gruffly if I had a good time, and said to "come back now"!Oh, I will, Baranof. &#160;I will. &#160;And if I'm lucky, I'll get hit on again by a man who just got home from a long-term jail sentence and gushes how stunning I am -- pretty enough to "get a real full-time job and stop selling weed." &#160;Ahhh, social norms... My night began wearing a suit and my night ended wearing Taco Bell! &#160; When I checked the "Yes" box for the Katie S. going away party, a fellow Yelper said, "For your first Yelp event you sure picked a doozy." &#160;I really did not understand that statement until two-three drinks into my night when I realized how strong the drinks were and the size of the shots. &#160;My night out at the Baranof was truly a great night. &#160;The drinks were good, the customers were friendly and interesting, and the staff was helpful. . . in getting me drunk. &#160; &#160;And the bill was very reasonable for the amount of drinks purchased. After leaving the bar I thought it would be a great idea to walk home. . .until I saw the Taco Bell sign. &#160; To make a long story short, the staff at Taco Bell on Aurora/90th got the pleasure of seeing the aftermath of a night out at the Baranof. &#160; On Monday, my dry cleaner will also get the pleasure of seeing the aftermath of a night out at the Baranof. &#160;No regrets. &#160;Thanks Baranof. Between getting molested by an inebriated octogenarian and relieving myself behind the none-too-private 3 foot high stall door, Baranof charmed my socks off.It's dark, aging, and unapologetic for being a true dive. Your beer may come with a fruit fly in it, but honey, that's just protein.And if you want a seat at the bar, you've gotta earn it. You need to show up at 6 am. Actually, you need to have shown up at 6 am in 1983 and never have left. You must drink from a rocks glass. You must love the ponies and yell at the TV. I bet I can earn a spot by 2022. I'll see you there...at 6 am with a whiskey on the rocks. My ass was grabbed at the Baranof--twice! &#160;I suppose that's par for the course at this boozy den of sin (and really, I can't blame one for wanting to squeeze my juicy ham). &#160;I had fun at my inaugural visit, but I really can't justify more than three stars.I like a good dive on occasion and the Baranof seems like a fun place to get shitfaced and sing karaoke out of tune--but neither one of those activities are up my alley. &#160;Plus when a gaggle of Yelpers descends upon the place it can be difficult to move--and it's so loud it's difficult to converse too.Despite the massive crowd the servers didn't seem to have trouble keeping up, nor did they seem particularly surly. &#160;Props to them for handling us with grace. &#160;I'm sure I'll be back someday. It was lovely to finally take a few hours to pretend I'm really a person again. &#160;And it was a nice idea to use a Yelp happy hour for an excuse.It definitely has a nice neighborhood feel to the place. &#160;Before I even got to sit down an friendly old patron was saying hello. &#160;The bartenders seem like the straight forward type and I like that. &#160;Tends to keep the younger crowd away.The best part was getting to hang out with Steve O. and my friends. &#160;(Sorry yelpers, I just can't be bothered saying hello to all the youngins) &#160;And I did get to hang out with a cool table of non-yelpers. &#160;Doing birthday Jello shots with strangers is just one of life's beautiful things. Some friends and I ended up at the Baranof last Friday night. We walked in and my friend was like, "is this the bar?" I told her this place was like a mullet, you have your restaurant business portion in the front and then have the bar party in the back. She understood once we walked into the bar. We were the youngest people by at least 50 years. One man had the thickest most powerful mustache I have ever had the privilege of seeing. To my delight, there were not many patrons there that night. The poor karaoke host who was wearing red leopard print spandex pants didn't have a job since no one signed up to sing. I could have never asked for a better Friday night. Strong drinks, fishing nets tacked to the ceiling with interesting and flavorful signage posted all over... You know you are at Baranof in Greenwood!Staff was completely helpful, friendly and on top of things! For the amount of drinks I had, the bill was unbelievably low.The front of the place is a resteraunt so if you want something to eat while drinking, they can definitely oblige with more than just bar nuts. &#160;Of course, they have their regulars, but my favorite was the yellow golden lab. &#160;What a sweetie that loved everyone and was completely mellow.If ever in need of a strong drink in Greenwood, will definitely return. Side note: The Baranof now welcomes any of the various omnivorous breeds of the even-toed ungulates from the family Suidae. Including, boars, hogs, and... oh so naturally... PIGS. Troughs are found in the bathrooms next to the sinks... wait... at least I hope that was a trough? Now that I think about it... Oh... god... what have I done!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&#173;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TOP TEN REASONS TO LOVE THE BARANOF!10. The lady hosting kareoke wont stop you from singing "Black Velvet" even though your the 4th person to sing it tonight.9. They'll serve you S.O.S (shit on a shingle) in the bar..8. the deck out back has a woman with an oxygen tank chain smoking.7. the nautical themed women's bathroom is almost always clean.6. The drinks ARE the stiffest in the city. but we all already knew that..5. The bartenders wear obscene amounts of blue eye shadow and black mascara to hide the fact they've been smokers since 1954 and it shows.4. There's a man with a cowboy hat who sits at the bar and buys all the ladies drinks so long as you sit there and listen to him gobble about shooting charlies.3. If someone wins on pull tabs (even a dollar, or two) the entire bar cheers.2.THEY MAKE A TURKEY EVERYDAY! like a real turkey. so when you get a turkey sandwich its not deli slices its like a day after thanksgiving sandwich.1. Its 6:30 am..where else can you get an all american breakfast with a shot of whiskey for under $5???? So, I don't like things that are dirty or skeezie...but I will make an exception for the Baranof. The staff is funny and must have smoked their way to the top of Greenwood's high society, but with the funniness comes a crass attitude that isn't my favorite. The karaoke selection is nothing to write home about. I enjoyed how calm it was for a Saturday night...and then the frat houses emptied and the world around me changed.I will of course go back...but there are much better options. Best bar ever. Used to live next door and while I love our new apt I do miss being able to stumble into the Baranof at will. Terri is a goddess and the rest of the crew is pretty close. Great beer and shot joint, and a fine cast of diverse regulars "to give the joint atmosphere." Loved hearing about kids coming in asking for a wine list (puh-lease!). Karaoke is a blast, love singing "Mack the Knife" any chance I could get. Need to get back up there again soon. Worth the trip. It's like the smoke shop with karaoke and wild decor.I want to like it, BUT... these jerks won't give anyone a glass of water, even a DD. &#160;They said they are only allowed to sell water on the weekends in bottles.... Cause they want to rip people off?After spending at least $40, you can't give me ONE glass of water?Otherwise, fun karaoke (though I wish they had more/new stuff, they did have it on laser disk - whaaaaat?). &#160;Good vibe, nice and trashy. &#160;Bathrooms smelled like cinnamon. DIVE BAR GALORE!Onced I walk in,I could breathe in the whole place from the front to the back of the bar of havoc and mayhem am about to get into!With a sea of drunk dwellers rockin away to an old school karaoke machine that play's those big laserdisc size records.You know your in a real dive bar joint,and that was on a friday night.I can imagine how crazy it must get during the weekend.If you can handle some serious partying than you've come to the right place!! For being my first time here it felt like I've been coming here for a while,I had fun with all the yelpers,the drinks were strong and people singing was fun :).The place has it's own character and it can get packed on a Friday night so I suggest to you here there early start drinking so by the end of the night you are ready to hit the stage ... The bathrooms are something else but you won't mind after a few visits hege,they also serve fish and chips and fries at the bar do that's a plus !!!Come here with a group of friends not to dressy and you'll have a blast!Xoxo Ipb We had decided we wanted to have a pitcher and that we wanted to go some place new... so my boyfriend hunted for a place close ( we also &#160;were doing some shopping as well... so we wanted something close to Fred Meyer or Safeway).The Baranof is the quintessential example of a good dive bar. Old men hitting on cute, women (interestingly, as long as the drinks kept coming the women did not mind much, ahh human nature) &#160;and not to sound repetitive, but to be repetitive, the ladies behind the bar make the stiffest drinks. We were also impressed with the chilled glasses we received with our pitcher, a rarity in a dive bar these days ( if you know where to get COLD beer let me know! :-))We went around 8:30pm-9:00pm on a Saturday night. About 15 people sitting around the bar and a few people playing pool. We were so impressed with the hidden location (in the back of a dinner...you actually walk through this, what seems like a deserted diner) in a great area..... Later that night, about 11:30pm we went back with our roommate to show off our secret discovery! Walking up, there was about 10 people hanging out in the front of the diner..hmmmm... we walked in and the place was PACKED! We were surprised at the number of people but it is understandable...with karaoke, stiff drinks, and pirate....stuff? Who wouldn't want to have a drink here!?I am eager to try the S.O.S. since I make a mean batch of it myself! To be continued...oh, the only concern I had was that there seemed to be a shuttle bus from Capital Hill to the bar, so you are forewarned...lol Ok, yesterday was my first visit to the Baranof and I only encountered the diner section of the place (can't wait to visit the bar, though)... but I have to say... I LOVED IT. &#160;First, I was up early and was hungry. &#160;So I got on Yelp and found out this place opens at 6am. &#160;NICE.Second thing I loved, anything on the menu can be ordered at any time of the day. &#160;NICE. &#160;Yeah, the menu was sticky, everything was greasy/diner food (but that's what I love most of the time), and my booth seat was totally sunken in... but when I read reviews about how strong their drinks are... boy howdy. &#160;I ordered one, small bloody mary and it KICKED MY ASS. &#160;Normally I might have two but after this little bad boy? &#160;I needed a nap.I ordered a simple plate of scrambled eggs, hash browns, toast, and sausage... and it was an absolute delight. &#160;I will absolutely be back.Baranof? &#160;You might have yourself another regular. The Baranof is the sub-particle that would result from smashing an early career Tom Wait's album and a David Lynch Film in a Particle Accelerator. &#160;It could be luck, but every time I go to the Baranof something occurs that shifts my reality into the 'WTF' range. &#160;The combination of location, staff and customers (regulars and weekend warriors) combine to serve as a reservoir of potential energy for weirdness. &#160;It's a good boozy weirdness... Cheap, strong, drinks are the order of the day - everyday. &#160;'Cause the piano has been drinking, the piano has been drinkingThe piano has been drinking, not me, not me, not me, not me, not me-T. Waits I'm giving it five stars just because the reuben sandwich is unbelievable. &#160;It's so good that I feel a little inappropriate eating it in public, what with the orgasmic moaning. &#160;When I went to Greenwood Academy of Hair I made it a priority to have a reuben there at least once a week. &#160;I couldn't tell you the first thing about the rest of the food... except that they have bacon salt, which is always a plus.Walking into the back of the can be a little disorienting your first time, one minute you're in a homey greasy spoon diner sitting next to a couple old guys reading the paper drinking highballs (at noon) and the next minute you're in the shantiest of divebars. &#160;Every Saturday I would stop in for a gin &amp; tonic or five... their drinks are no joke. &#160;Those little old ladies take a highball glass, fill it almost to the top with gin, add a just the weensiest splash of tonic, and before you know it you're totally schnockered and getting hit on by an octogenarian alcoholic. &#160;Good times to be had all around. The Baranof is closest thing you can get to drinking inside of a Tom Waits song in Seattle. So many crumbling beauties here with razor sadness. I have to say...the first time i came into the Baranof I was a bit put off by the ' fear and lothing' scene but the Bar staff is amazingly friendly, the drinks crazy strong, and the food is hometown good and fresh. The jukebox is a okay and once you get to know the locals, you are in! As an alcoholic and a cheap bastard, there's no place better than the Baranof to get completely shithouse wasted amongst such a diversified crowd of people. &#160;A place where debauchery, but not douchebaggery, are encouraged and even if you fall off your barstool, you will more than likely still be served. &#160;Although my roommate is in love with there biscuits and gravy, I can't eat breakfast here, unless it's more beer or whiskey that I can start &#160;purchasing at 6 a.m. &#160;I recommend Xmas and Thanksgiving here in lieu of, or after, dinner with the fam damily. Wicked cool bar, one of the last hold outs against yuppie hipster hangouts. &#160;People here are not fake, but real honest workers (and drinkers).It's a dive bar, but that's what makes it so great! Some friends and I were on a west coast Drive about and were looking for a bar that was more our style since there are not too many upper class bars in Montana... That being said this bar was right up our alley!! We had a great dinner in the cafe before hand and then made our way to the back bar...We were greeted by some Greenwood locals and was challenged to a game of pool (they kicked our butts!) The Karaoke started...Now we all know that Karaoke is the word for tone deaf in Japanese,but it didn't matter these people were having lots of fun and so we participated with our little mermaid seagull style crooning (this is not a good thing) and the locals cheered us on by calling out GO MONTANA! &#160;Stiff drinks, amazing people and all around fun! I will totally come back my next visit to the Northwest! What a neat spot! I'd never been to Baranof until this past weekend and I really had a great time. The crowd was diverse, the drinks were strong, and the place was hoppin'! Karaoke came on later in the evening and kept the crowd thoroughly entertained. There are plenty of stools at the bar, plenty of tables for small and large groups, a billiards table, and an outdoor smoking area. I can't talk much about the food but I did hear from other patrons that it's tasty. Next time I'm here I'll have to order some grub! Once, I made the mistake of asking the waitress for a "less stiff drink." I got a glass of water. Point well taken: the Baranof is for hard-core alcohol lovers. You order a whiskey and soda and what you will get is a glass of whiskey and a splash of soda. This place has a friendly vibe and hosts very democratic karaoke performances. Ok, so I just moved here and was looking for a down to earth bar close to home and saw the reviews of the Baranof here. &#160;I LOVE a good dive bar, and this is the best of the dives.Bartenders and regulars are friendly and honest good folk with character and flare. &#160;I think a camera needs to be set up to film this place as the next reality show because it &#160;always entertains! &#160; Stiff drinks as mentioned, and as for the blue eye shadow, have not found it yet, as well as the oxygen tank lady, but will keep you posted!But I did find some well experienced and polished bartenders who may not be in their 20's, but have the lust for life of one who is and try to have fun with all around. &#160;These women rock! &#160;They work hard, and play hard like we all should.So, yeh, go have a beer or even better a stiff drink - bite from the turkey and fill up, its the Cheers of Seattle, all characters included, all types accepted, and always a good time. We went to Katie's going away party here, and it was sweet. &#160;My friend and I sang a couple of karaoke songs each and then went down to gallery hop several galleries at the Greenwood Art Collective. &#160;Cool night! &#160;Going into Baranof is like entering a dive bar in another state...or maybe just in Spokane. &#160;Hanging fish net, a fun rounded bar, karoake. &#160;I dig. &#160;It's right next door to the Greenwood Art Collective where artists chipped in for music, beer, wine, and cheese for a sweet night. &#160;Nice spot. &#160;I'll be back. 5 stars for the awesome karaoke, 4 stars for the cheap stiff drinks, and 3 stars for the fact that their jello shots are made with tequila (that is felonious in my book) but only cost $2. Baranof is fun times for fun people! This is one interesting establishment. &#160;The "even-toed ungulates" wandering around were all highly amusing with their drunk dancing and off-key but passionate karaoking. &#160;I enjoyed all the xmas lights on the walls. &#160;I did not enjoy the bathroom stall doors that I could see over, while sitting on the toilet. &#160;My friends and I very much enjoyed the karaoke, but the mic kept cutting out so that kinda sucked. &#160;I was not wowed by this place, but I think the potential for a good time is there, especially if the other people who have been reviewing this place are regulars. Cheap drinks and even cheaper company, Baranoff is a great local dive. Karaoke is a given. Breakfast is decent and price is always right. Dear Yelp, this place is badass! Ample amounts of fish in said fish sandwhich. Best bathroom DJ ever and I found some keys, which will be perfect for my collection. I did however not like the hipster with a limp who may or may not be gay, not that I have a problem with the gays, I love'em! Also, screw The Toadies. This place is like Pioneer Square in the middle of Greenwood. &#160;Where do all these people come from? &#160;I hear it is dead though, when they don't have karaoke. &#160;But when the karaoke machine is working, this place has loads of young wild kids packing the house! The Baranof was an unknown, sunken dingy before last weekends' trip. With salty, hilarious bartenders, drunkards of all creeds, seriously good Chicken Wings and Popeye on the bathroom door, this place had me at hello. I grew up not far away, probably spraying the dilapidated patio and its Pall Mall crew with Supersoakers and water baloons, but now I yearn for its comfy bosom and a can of Ranier. A wise man once said you can have anything in life if you will sacrifice everything else for it. What he meant is nothing comes without a price. So before you go into battle, you better decide how much you're willing to lose. Walking into the Baranof I was willing to lose a few things..1) My pride 2) My wallet 3) My heart. All in all, I think the only thing I ended up losing was my heart. I had heard a lot about this place from Yelp, &#160;So naturally I was excited to see first hand. I think most of the people who frequent this place have to pay rent for their barstool. There was a lot of regulars here, which says to me, "We like it here and we don't give a flying frick who knows it!" I like that a bar can make people declare such things like that. It's awesome that they had some Tv's...watching Golf or Soccer while sitting on their awesome red booths really was a good way to spend an hour. The service was friendly, the drinks were good, and the bathroom stalls would be a great make out spot if you could get over the fact that the stall doors are super, super, short. This night was very memorable. Who knows if I will go here again, but the time I did spend here was fantastic and one that I will never forget. And not just because of the beauitful decor. What!? I haven't reviewed The Baranof yet!? Oh yeah, it's probably because I don't really have a clear memory of any time I've been here. I don't even remember how many times I've been there, because none of them have been anything remotely resembling sober.But that's the point of The 'Noff -- to achieve the highest concentration of alcohol for the least $$ and then sing some questionable Karaoke. i love this place. i consider it my second home. terry, my great friend and bartender, is such hot stuff. &#160;great people watching, strong drinks, badass karaoke, and a guaranteed good time. find me at baranof anytime! lets sing a song together! all these years on yelp and yet this is my first visit to baranof and my 1ST SHPOC HH i've attended : )unforgettable details of the baranof include:-the smell of vomit (although i wish i could forget this)-seeing K-TOWN!!! woo hoo : )-the BIG man-made http://yelp.com sign on the wall -the chicken tenders!!-popeye and olive oyl on the bathroom doors-the oddly low bathroom doors-the naked mermaid on the bathroom wallthis place is so so interesting and i'm glad to have finally stopped by... a yelpers haven is what i have summed it up to!!thanks alot you SHPOC!!! ; ) {Based on drinking there one night} &#160; &#160;My bartending shift at the Greenwood Art Collective was over, and I had this adorable Irish redhead pestering me to go drink with the locals at the Baronof. &#160;Mind you, I"m not much of a drinker, but I'm always up for checking out a new spot, and seeing as I was everyone's best friend already (server of liquid love) I decided it wouldn't be a horrible idea. &#160; Looked like a total craphole from out front, and a dead one at that. &#160;We entered a greasy spoon looking diner, and passed thru a hallway, under the radioactive office space lighting, and into a dark, sea shantied back room. &#160;Looked like a dive bar, but didn't taste like one. &#160;Vodka and cran, $3.50, filled to the brim, probly 4 oz's of vodka. *gulp* &#160;I normally only serve the large red nosed pro alky's those kinds of drinks, but they pour them all......night......long! &#160;Do not go there for beer or wine. &#160;Go there for the hard stuff, plenty of it, and yelp in jubilation after you realize you only spent $12 the whole night. The drinks are strong, not very expensive, has the right amount of dive ambiance and they have Karaoke. I'm sold. I couldn't be happier to review the Baranof for my 200th review!This is my absolute favorite place to be in Greenwood. I love everything about this place, from the bad karaoke selection to the half-stall doors in the bathroom to the hilariously grumpy bartenders. However, I think my favorite thing about the Baranof is the diversity of people that gather here. You have a sampling of Seattle in one room: hipsters, grizzled old men, college kids, a bachelorette party, 40's-ish women wearing leopard print leggings, etc. It's impossible to feel out of place here, no matter who you are.I have yet to try the cafe in the front of the place, but I'm told they have good grub. Typically when I'm here I'm more focused on getting trashed on cheap (AND STRONG) drinks, than food.
Mais Oui!I just finished scarfing down the best peach tarte I've ever tasted! It wasn't my first choice but since they make everything from scratch everyday they sometimes run out of stuff and that's a risk I'm willing to take. There are some eclairs in the pastry case that are calling my name, a chocolate pot, and a few pieces of cake. Besides the cocophony of pastry noise they are playing some French music and there is a couple speaking French behind me. The Francophile in me is very very happy right now :)Update:I have brought home baguettes from here on multiple occasions and the inside is always the consistency of wonder bread. Weird. They say French women don't get fat...well walking into this place even the AIR has calories. As soon as you enter, you're enveloped in the aromas of baked goods -- eclairs, sticky buns, pastries, cakes, croissants, and bread bread bread. It smells great, even for a confessed carbophobe. Their lunch special is great (as others have reviewed) and well-priced. The sandwiches you get on a little baguette or croissant are nothing to write home about, but they hit the spot. A ham and swiss contains a piece of ham, a piece of cheese, a leaf of lettuce and a slice or two of tomato. You get a drink as well, and a pastry if you want -- I would always decline but my coworkers would rave about the pastries. Don't come right at 12 unless you like to line up. And sometimes the ordering process gets backed up if the staff have to operate the espresso machine or do something not in the rote order. It's a good place to grab lunch and if you're on the way to a friend's place and need to bring dessert, stop in here for a pastry selection. C'est magnifique! Wonderful spot. The lunch special is certainly the way to go. Rather than echo the commentary already here, I'll simply point out that the new Whole Foods in Redmond carries various things from Le Fournil in their bakery case (where you'd find doughnuts)Awesome for weekend mornings when you wake up on the east side. :) This is the BEST french bakery. &#160;With A La Francaise gone - it was hard to find another. Really really delicious pastries. And very good sandwiches. And not that expensive. Yum! I could talk about the bread pudding or the blackberry tart or the creme brule (which I actually only saw there once, but was everything a creme brule could possibly be and more), but the real reason I go to Le Fournil is the tuna sandwhiches. It's really kind of strange - I don't even like sandwiches all that much, but the tuna is herby (basil, oregano and thyme, maybe?) and bright tasting, and absolutely beyond delicious. Two words: Lunch. Special.I used to work somewhat close to Le Fournil, and it was always an easy sell to convince me to pick up lunch here. If I happened to swing by for breakfast, I'd grab a croissant and some juice.But for lunch, it's always the same thing: pate on a baguette with mustard and cornichons, choux with chocolate on top, and a fresh-squeezed orange juice. All for $7.99. It used to be even cheaper, but it's still a decent deal in my book.Alas, I no longer work in the neighborhood. But if the opportunity arises to "randomly" pass by there, it's a safe bet I'll make a stop. This cafe has the feel of a small, family-run French bakery... it actually just may be. &#160;Every time you walk by their store front in the morning, you can smell the delicious bakery good from half a mile away. &#160;I'm a rower with a crew that practices just across the street from them -- and dammit every Saturday morning when we are docking our boats we get a nice aromatic reminder to stop in after practice. &#160;Their coffee is pretty good... the bakery goods excellent! &#160;It's truly a fine treat on a cold Saturday morning in Seattle.$6.99 lunch special includes a sandwich (usually $5.25), a small drink (coffee, juice, soda, etc), and a small pastry of up to $2.95. &#160;Yummy in my tummy...And yes they do deliver if your order cost more than 50 bucks... say if you had 20 hungry rowers right across the street who just got done with a hard workout... I think once I saw the (cute) owner herself coming over with boxes of pastries. &#160;That's customer service right there. I've had a delicious cake from here, an OK sandwich, and just today had a very very disappointing "cheese tart." &#160;Jam over a soggy yet dry crust (how was that possible?) with a tasteless cheesecake. &#160;Reminded me of the sad desserts served at hotel banquets. &#160;$3.00. Bonjour! This place is great, and the best part is that they are bilingual. That's right, they speak English AND French here! So, if you order "le baguette", they know what you mean. Quite impressive, in my short and simply-worded book.My favorite thing about Le Fournil is the food, but the handy parking comes in a close third (after of course the friendly staff). I get the lunch special, which, although it just went up a dollar from $7.50 to $8.50 (with tax), is still a good deal. I get the camembert sandwich, pear tart, and lemonade. The bread is extremely fresh, slightly tangy, and crunchy enough to add texture without tearing up the roof of your mouth. You really should go to Le Fournil, and if you do, look for me. I'll be the one using words like "oui" and "fromage" to try and sound sofisticated.
A couple years ago, I gave Toyoda the full five stars, but after a recent visit, I have to agree with some of the recent posters that this once great sushi joint has gone downhill.We were seated quickly and given the mayo noodles, which not ten seconds later another waitress attempted to take away. &#160;Then the first waitress came back and asked for our order two seconds after we had picked up our menus. &#160;Time elapsed: &#160;12 seconds. &#160;The waitress came back two more times in the next minute to demand our order. &#160;The place was not even busy! &#160;Of course, once she brought our order to us, we never saw her again.The one unpardonable sin, however, is that when I specifically ordered "kani" (REAL crab served nigiri style) I received instead ground surimi drenched in mayonnaise. &#160;Yuck!The fish is still very fresh and tasty, the homemade giant gyoza are excellent, and the place still retains the jovial izakaya atmosphere. &#160;For these reasons, I am only downgrading Toyoda by two stars instead of three. &#160;However, the service was abominable--by turns pushy and non-existent. &#160;I will probably eat here again, but I will definitely sit at the counter, not at a table. I've only been to Toyoda a couple times, but I wasn't terribly impressed with the decor (kind of dingy), the service (slow), and the food (they tend to use a crapload of mediocre wasabi, which massively overpowers the fish flavors). Toyoda Sushi isn't bad, but I think it's overpriced considering its location, ambiance, and food quality. There are definitely better sushi options in Seattle for the same price. The place has lots of positive ratings on other networks, a few years running now...and I just don't get it. It's not bad, per say, but its not the best I've had either. The Tuna Sashimi was like butter and melted in my mouth; the chef even gave us extra cuts on the house. However, my rolls were standard and the seaweed was a bit hard to chew. The service was pretty quick considering it was a busy Friday night. My biggest gripe was the amount of those fucking annoying gnats that seem to come out this time of year...or when you let food rot. As soon as our food was placed down, we were swarmed; it was all we could do to rush through our food and get the bill, to get outta there posthaste. Trying to catch bugs, Ala Daniel-san is fun on the side, but not when you're trying to defend your food. I will never ever go back.We had slow, bad and rude service.I found the place very dirty. A little research and I confirmed this.Everyone else seems to love this place...I have no idea why. I've heard and read some good reviews for Toyoda for a while and it's close to where I live, so one Thursday late evening my boyfriend and I decided to swing by and try it out. &#160;First impression wasn't too good to begin with - we walked in and attempted to get seated but waited for a couple minutes before they acknowledged our entrance, despite it wasn't all that crowded or busy. &#160;When we got seated the waitress left us with 2 menus and rushed off to somewhere else, while another waiter came by and dropped off bowls of miso and salad/ appetizer. &#160;I was slightly surprised as we haven't even ordered yet and we continued to sit with the soup and salad for the next 10 minutes without any utensils or opportunity to order.I'm usually a big fan of hole-in-the-wall Japanese places (Musashi and Sushi Maki are my staples) - don't really mind the lack of space and have the patience to wait till my turn for service. &#160;But Toyoda's sticky tables and flies grossed me out throughout the dinner. &#160;They were also less than average generous with their wasabi (and it didn't help given that it's hard to catch anybody's attention in the restaurant).In terms of food, my boyfriend likes their spicy tuna roll (second only to Sushi Maki). &#160;Their specialty Caterpillar sushi (avocado with unagi) was good but too sweet for our taste, and literally resembles a caterpillar. &#160;The karage chicken was a big piece of tastless fried chicken (again, didn't help to not have plates or bowls to eat with. &#160;Maybe that's why the tables were so sticky).There's something that appears to be horse radish or certain part of a spring onion that comes in the Mentaiko maki which gives a really strong after taste. &#160;We also ordered a maki of yellow tail with scallop which tasted good but has plenty of my nemesis spring onions in them. &#160;I have been to Japan a couple of times and never seen rolls with green onions. &#160;WHY? WHY? WHY? &#160;I kept asking myself as I pick through my food.In summary, the food was not good, the hygiene seems scary, and the service was awful. &#160;So I wasn't too happy and didn't plan to return when - after spending 20 minutes trying to waive somebody down for the bill as they are chatting in Korean with one patron and Mandarin with another family, and busying closing down the store, leaving the 2 of us the last customers to leave - the bill ended up $50 for the 4 rolls and 1 chicken dish that we had.For $50 I could easily fill us both up at Musashi's or Sushi Maki. Toyoda lost the love a long time ago. Get there early and SIT AT THE BAR! &#160;The chefs are helpful and fun to watch. &#160;Willing to make any cut into any style. &#160;It is more expensive, but very fresh. &#160;The area is small and can get very crowded, the quality of food is worth it. Solid traditional Japanese-American restaurant. Not unlike other restaurants in its category. But there are definitely better Japanese places in Seattle. It's average, which means it's pretty good.It's a Lake City cornerstone. The owner is a nice guy. Their food is great. The service can be spotty since it's always totally packed. Remember, they have restricted hours, so check before going. I go here to eat sashimi, it's pretty expensive- but seemed really fresh to me. Really good place if you're North of Seattle! Great deal. &#160;Not the fanciest sushi but you get more than your monies worth. &#160;Usually you get extra!! Try it The service is friendly. &#160;We went on a sat. night but was seated promptly at the sushi bar (our choice). &#160;We ordered sushi rolls and a yakitori appetizer. &#160;The rolls tasted very fresh. &#160;The owner/sushi chef even asked us if we wanted our one piece split into two so that both of us can taste it. &#160;Never had any restaurants do that for no charge. &#160;Although the fish was very fresh and tasty, I do have to say that it's not the best rolled sushi in terms of the skill. &#160; In conclusion, I'd recommend this place if you are in the area. &#160;If you are in the ID area, Tsukushinbo is the one I'd recommend.
It was raining, it was windy, and it was cold. &#160;The perfect conditions to bring on a craving for pho, and Pho Tai turned out to be the lucky recipient of our business that day. &#160;It was noon on a Saturday and fairly empty inside, so we were seated and served very quickly.The menu consists primarily of Vietnamese dishes, although there is some Japanese teriyaki and Chinese thrown in for good measure. &#160;We both went with the obvious choice of pho. &#160;Choosing the small size, mine was the steak and meatball combo with a fried roll on the side, while hers was steak and brisket.The pho, at first bland taste, worried me, as I was not terribly impressed by the broth. &#160;But once all the good bits were stirred back into suspension from the bottom of the bowl, I found it to be very rich and beefy. &#160;The noodles were of thinner variety and were not overcooked. &#160;I usually order the beef on the side, just to prevent it from becoming too tough, but this time, I had forgotten. &#160;Lucky for me, the beef was very thinly sliced and remained nicely tender. &#160;The beef balls were chopped a little coarsely and had some rather large bits of tendon, but they had a nice texture and were very tasty otherwise.In all, we were happy with everything but the fried roll and condiments. &#160;The fried roll was not very impressive and had a rather boring presentation. &#160;It was served very plainly with a bowl of not-so-spicy dipping sauce and served without at least a lettuce leaf wrap. &#160;The filling was not much better and seemed to be more carrot than anything else. &#160;For the condiments, the basil and lime were unfortunately a few days past fresh and wilting. &#160;Not a deal-breaker, but not the most appetite-inspiring presentation either. &#160;In an otherwise clean and well-lit restaurant, we were surprised to see this detail overlooked.Minus the minor issues, this served our pho craving nicely overall. &#160;At about $6.00 for a small bowl, the price seemed fairly reasonable, and our server was friendly. &#160;If you are looking for a simple bowl of pho with a rich broth, you should do fine by this place.
I happened upon this place while driving between Magnolia and Fremont on the Nickerson side of the canal. Great food, great service, clean and friendly staff.I love the fact that you can get in and out on a lunch break with a delicious and reasonably priced meal.I've had 4 or 5 different menu items all of which were great and they accommodated my need for very spicy food. I now request 5 million stars on every dish and they nail it every time.I think I've eaten there about 20 times now and keep bringing friends along to experience the same as I have.I'm looking forward to a happy hour visit soon. We went here with a groupon. Location is great. Service was pretty miserable. I think entrance was just in a weird location, because we walked in and no one seated us because no one saw us. Finally after standing for a few minutes, we walked over to the kitchen where a gal greeted us and sat us down. We ordered phad see eww, and a stirfry and springrolls. The springrolls were quite bland. &#160;The thai ice tea we ordered had a dead bug in it! so gross. The food overall was decent. not quite authentic. The most annoying part was the fact that they kept forgetting to bring us the spice rack or lime, etc. Probably won't be back, I understand why they were on a groupon. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.I ordered delivery from here through Livingsocial. &#160;It was supposed to be delivered at 7:30. I ordered at 6:30. They attempted to deliver my food at 7.., and I wasn't home yet... Which is precisely why it was supposed to be delivered at 7:30. &#160;I didn't receive the phone calls because I was still in class.After class ended, I called the restaurant back when I was chastised and told that they had attempted to call me 10 times (untrue). She refused to answer why the food was a half hour early and told me to come and pick up my food. Luckily, the delivery guy called and offered to deliver it. He was very nice. However, when he came, he brought a letter reprimanding me! He told me that the letter was from his manager and he looked straight up ashamed.A REPRIMANDING LETTER?! Are you effing kidding me? The letter told me that I was to be home when I ordered and next time they would charge me for a re-delivery. OR how about you honor your delivery time?! &#160;Horrific customer service. Needless to say, I will find my curry elsewhere from now on. &#160;I will upload the letter for all to see. Thai Fusion is a great place for a relaxed lunch. It's sort of the upscale version of Thai 1-2-3, which is just a couple of blocks away on Nickerson. I work &#160;just a couple of blocks away from Thai Fusion on Nickerson (in the other direction), but I'm more inclined to drive a bit longer and go to Thai 1-2-3, just due to slowness issues here. Parking has been easy to find in the two visits I made here. The place was always packed, and that made service rather slow, but once the food arrived it was very good.If I was thinking ahead a bit more I would order from Thai Fusion online or by phone, and get my food fast enough to make it work for me on my lunch break. But my modus operandi is more like, "Hey, where do you guys want to go for lunch." as we're headed out the door. So, Thai 1-2-3 it is. The food here is pretty good (so, kudos to the kitchen) but management seems to be the problem, on all levels. To customers-take the consistent one-star ratings seriously as they have measured out! I have been here for lunch before and had a good experience.... however the last time I was here... I ordered food via online for takeout. The time quoted was twenty minutes. I showed up 25 minutes, just so i wouldn't have to wait. Boy was I wrong. I ended up sitting there for 45 minutes waiting for my food. And what I saw and heard made me sick to my stomach. ...It became fairly clear that there were only four people working in the restaurant: two in the kitchen, one who was expediting the food coming from the kitchen, and one covering all the tables and the bar (it was obvious that she was the manager, if not the owner). There were only two groups of people sitting at the various tables in the restaurants, and numerous people in the bar. The people sitting in the restaurant had to get up to request more water. REALLY? One group of people came in and sat down at a table and ended up sitting for so long (10 min) with NO attention that they left, because they got NO service. WHAT?Then every time I heard a takeout order getting ready to go, it was someone elses... who was in the bar waiting for their takeout. so they had been waiting just as long as I had! but the WORST was listening to the interaction between the waitress/manager and the expeditor. It was very clear the expeditor was new, and the manager YELLED and RAILED on her every chance she got. until the young girl cried. it was HORRIBLE. finally after I was the ONLY person in the restaurant waiting for my takeout, and my order was finally ready, the expeditor handed to to me and apologized for the wait. You better believe I gave that manager a piece of my mind. that poor employee. I will NEVER EVER go to Thai Fusion again. Too bad, because the food was really good.It was definitely Thai Fusion on Nickerson, and the date was Friday August 10th. I could forgive the dirty table, the dried shrimp tail on the condiment tray, and the rude server, but not when the food was that forgettable.We ordered some Pad Thai and Crab Fried Rice. &#160;Both were bland. &#160;The server seemed annoyed by our presence. &#160;No need for a return visit. After what happened today I will not be coming back. I have given this place numerous chances to improve their service, and it's been bad nearly every time. Not only was the service non-existent and cold (on a SLOW day), when they threw away my left-over food instead of bringing it back in the to-go box that THEY asked if I wanted AND chose to "box" for me, that was the last straw! Waiter started looking under the counter for my left-overs!? Wtf?! I will never let a waiter box my left-overs ever again. Sucks... this is the closest Thai place to me.. oh well you blew it! I've been to Thai Fusion for happy hour and lunch and I like it! I've been able to park right out front on the weekend which is great. I've had the coconut shrimp, fresh rolls, chicken satay skewer, and pad see ew with chicken. I had the pad see ew this last time and it was good. Good flavor. I got medium as the range is mild, medium, or hot. I did get hot sauce to add more of my own flavor. The fresh rolls with peanut sauce were delicious. &#160;Decor is nice. Service is okay but not very outgoing or warm.I like Thai Fusion and will come back when in the area. Prices are good! My lunch pad see ew was $9.95. The food is consistently fresh and delicious. The typical mainstays of phad thai, curries (especially the red curry and the pumpkin curry), larb gai (they add a little kick with crispy rice), and soups are all done well. The fresh rolls were a litlle disappointing because it was mainly veggies with a very thin wedge of tofu. Although they have a full cocktail menu, many of their cocktails were too weak for me. I would stick with a simple mixed drink or a beer. The inside decor is nice and modern, and the service is prompt and friendly. This is a good place to go to for a quick and casual meal that won't break the bank. The food here is always good so we tend to put up with the crappy service. &#160;The staff tend to ignore you and take forever to give you your check. &#160;The best option would be to get takeout and avoid the frustration. Disappointed with my second visit as the first visit was stellar and memorable. &#160;A year or so had passed between visits, so things have just gone downhill. &#160;The sparkling new decor was looking dirty with visible debris on the floors. &#160;The wait staff was inattentive. &#160;And the food was.. meh at best. &#160;WIth so many Thai restaurants to choose from in Seattle, I won't be returning (even with another groupon deal). A lot of times proximity dictates your willingness to continue visiting an establishment. &#160;Or, at least for me, it sure has. &#160;The work week is busy, the routine is established, your hours are limited, thus making places that reside along your natural routes important. &#160;Thai Fusion happens to be one of these places for me. &#160;I actually enjoy the food, but since I stopped eating meat, I actually have missed an item on the menu (which I believe is no longer available anyways). &#160;There doesn't seem to be anything over the top special about the food, but it is always consistent and for that, I appreciate it. &#160;What I really like about this place is their Saturday night Jazz music in the dining area. &#160;Typically, the music revolves around lounge inspired techno music (is that a thing??? &#160;It is here.) but on this one night, 3 local Jazz musicians invade for an evening that is completely different than the others. &#160;Finally, the servers here are great. &#160;Going back to consistency, they are always consistently nice and seem to recognize you if you've been in more than a few times. I drive by this place all the time but never stop in so the other night when we decided we wanted Thai, so I decided to give it a try. &#160; It was close to 8:30, so we were being lazy and so looked on line and saw they delivered, so we went with that.I have NO idea what was going on there, but they must have put me on hold 3 times, but I could hear noises like banging going on in the back ground, then they would pick up the phone, start to take the order, then ask me to hold again and come back a few minutes later. &#160;Again, I have NO idea what was going on, but my cel phone shows the call was over 11 minutes long and it took maybe 2 minutes to order the food. &#160;The delivery guy got here about the time they said they would, so that was good, but another odd thing was, the guy looked like he may be the dishwasher as the front of his shirt was totally wet. &#160;It was not raining, so wasn't that :)Now for the food.. it was pretty good. &#160;I got the Volcano Chicken and every other time I had got that at other restaurants, it was deep fried chicken, but this wasn't, deep fried and it was pretty darn good. &#160; I liked the seasoning, only thing is that it didn't come with enough rice, &#160;I am guessing maybe half a cup. It came with a large portion of chicken, so it was a bit odd they skimp on the rice. It &#160;needed more sauce and was not spicy at all, which is odd coming from a Thai restaurant and a item called "Volcano Chicken" you would have thought it would be spicy .. along those lines the only real complaint (other than the odd service for the to go order) is that they didn't ask how many stars I wanted on any of the 3 items I ordered. &#160;I didn't even realize it until I started eating it and it was not spicy &#160;at all and I like my food with some spice. &#160; I guess it was my fault for not telling them I wanted all my food with 3 stars, but I don't think I have ever NOT been asked at a Thai Restaurant how many stars I want. &#160; Isn't that kind of the point of Thai food?Anyway, I have my own spicy chili sauce in my fridge, so I grabbed that and doused it over all 3 items I ordered and that fixed that problem.I will definitely give them another shot as I did like the flavors, I just need to make sure I remember I need to tell them if I want any stars. We had a Groupon coupon and tried this place. Parking is not the easiest to find. We parked on the street. The restaurant is nicely decorated. The restaurant was about 1/3 full for dinner on a Wednesday night. We ordered crispy egg rolls that were boring --- nothing special, the standard cabbage and carrots. The Panang chicken had decent flavor, but very little sliced chicken swimming an a pool of curry sauce. The beef stew thin bean noodles was NOT successful. The beef was dry, the sweet soy and anise-like sauce was TOO salty (almost inedible). The best thing was the bottle of wine. The service was not great....the appetizer and main dishes all came together and the waitress rarely checked in. There are too many Thai choices to return. &#160;If only Bai Tong was in Queen Anne and not Tukwila and Redmond! &#160;It's worth the drive with a strong enough craving! I don't take this lightly and I realize this is a serious problem. Due to the infrequency to which I use my debit card I have narrowed down to this restaurant. If you go to this restaurant and there are other reasons not to go, like the bland food, but if you do pay with cash. Do yourself a favor and don't use your debit or credit cards. The food that is listed as vegetarian contains fish sauce. &#160;NOT VEGETARIAN. Giving it only 3 stars because it's never as hot as I order it. &#160;Have had the red curry many times in the past. &#160;Good food, but not spicy enough. Tried the Hammered Noodles recently; again, good, but not spicy enough! I've been eating here for two years. Well, not in the restaurant. Always take-out or delivery. The delivery service has always been excellent. You can even order online, which I appreciate. The food always arrives prompt and hot and tasty. I usually get Pad Thai or Pad See Ew or Pad Kee Mao and all are very delicious and properly spiced to my tastes and request.
I work a block away from them and a slight suggestion if you are planning to eat there for lunch. Get it to-go!!!! If you order food to go, it takes like 10 minutes for everything to be ready, however if you sit down (I did it about 3 times and I regret it every time), it takes like 20-30 minutes for the food to be ready. And last two time that I came, they forgot my drink. NOT just ONCE, but TWICE!! But otherwise, pho is decent, and I LOVEEE their eggrolls!!! The Pho itself is pretty good, not GREAT, but definitely good enough to warrant the high traffic that comes here. I do love that they serve their Pho with a side dipping sauce that includes ginger. Try it, it tastes very good.Service seems accommodating, l didn't notice anything wrong with it. I imagine this place, like all other Pho places is just a quick stop for many lunch-goers during the lunch hour, or during breaks. A lot of to-go orders. Overall, a good place to get a bite, though like most other Pho restaurants, nothing spectacular. Let me just start this review by saying that I get the same thing here every time. I know, boring, but it's just so tasty. I'm talking about the charbroiled pork. It's the perfect combo of pork, noodles, veggies, and sauce. I've tried to branch out and try other things--charbroiled pork with shrimp--but the classic is just so perfect I just keep skimming the menu and selecting the #16...without fail. I have to say that I did try a friend's broth and it was pretty flavorful and tasty. One of these days, I might actually get around to trying actual pho! The place is crowded, and yes, you might wait for a minute by a breezy door to get a seat, but it's worth the wait. Great food (love the Vietnamese sandwhiches) but absolutely terrible service. Don't expect to get in and out quickly. I used to work at Starbucks HQ and I am addicted to Pho'. &#160;So this was the only place to go and it satisfied my craving. &#160;But. &#160;The staff ignore you once your seated. &#160;I have eaten here about 15 times and 3 times no less they kept forgetting my water i ordered. &#160; This place is extremely busy. &#160;Especially between 12-1:30. &#160;If there is a line out the door you might want to go elsewhere as a lot of customers just go in there and sit and chit chat and slowly eat. &#160;Prices are good &#160;I always got the Pho Tai. &#160;Rare steak. &#160;It is not the best Pho' i have had but it does the job. &#160;I would eat here if i was in the SODO area and had a sudden Pho' craving. &#160;And to the girls that work there- &#160;Does smiling make your face ache ? &#160;You might get a bigger tip if you smiled and seemed happy to have a job, something I don't have right now.
don't think of them as only a pho restaraunt! They have excellent Bahn Mi (sp?) - Sandwiches - cheap, filling, and delicious!. And for the vegitarians out there, the tofu one is fantastic!! Like others, I suggest calling in an order ahead of time. Thier menu is available online. Best fresh rolls in the city. Nice atmosphere for a hole-in-the wall! Pretty much the most reliable Pho in Seattle. It is very tasty and every time I go there it is the same high quality. It's great to have a place be so predictable. Only issue is, from about 11:45-1:30pm it's packed. I wish they had a bit of a bigger place. But then, it'd probably be just as packed. Also wish they would stay open later, they close at 4pm and sometimes it'd be nice for dinner. for my vietnamese craving it totally hit the spot... whether it is quality vietnamese food i have to say not so much... it plays on this fusion theme and presents things i am not really used to- goi cuon num nuong... nice wrapping and i lovedddd the fried wonton strip found inside... however if u think about it... they are supposed to use fried shallots, fried wonton strips is really just a way to substitute the real thing with a cheaper ingredient... the peanut sauce was nicely made and not too thick!- cha gio - used regular egg skin rolls which was kinda disappointing and lacked some ingredients of taro or crabmeat which is what makes this spring roll traditionalpho cyclo - yay meatballs in the special! &#160;always a plus for me... the broth looked promising considering how fatty it looked... but then i tasted it and it lacked flavor after a while... maybe they don't put msg in it and thats why? &#160;regardless i ate it in bliss and dipped in this fish sauce that they usually only give to people who order pho ga... but this was a nice different kick to things that i shall try in the future! &#160;mix it with hoisin sauce and life is good!
This is the only pho place that I go to these days. &#160;The soup is always hot (exactly how I like it) and the soup is very flavorful, although I do suspect MSG in their soup b/c I do get quite thirsty afterwards. &#160;Their dry vietnamese noodles with grilled pork balls are also a gem! &#160;I've had their papaya bubble tea which is also very good. &#160;Service is good, pretty consistent, we go so much that they pretty much know what we will order before we do =). &#160;We go a lot during the winter since it is always so cold and rainy in Seattle. &#160;Def. my go to comfort food! This place rules. The pho is pretty good and I love the little ginger dipping sauce that it comes it with. They also have really great noodle and rice dishes for a great price. The branch on Capitol Hill is not nearly as good. I find the sandwiches decent but not great and I wish they opened for dinner. It's still a great spot and worth the drive. Great place to people watch and get a good bowl of Pho! This place is pretty no-frills. But what is great about it is the consistently good, cheap food. I come here specifically for the vegetarian Pho, which is the best in town. The broth is perfect, the noodles are always wonderful and they pack the soup full of &#160;an assortment of fresh veggies. The egg rolls are great too. The tea is always good and hot and the Vietnamese coffee is not bad either.The great big windows make this a wonderful people-watching spot. The music is usually pretty awful Techno/ R&amp;B but somehow it works. Good rice noodle bowl and tea in a comfortable yet busy setting during lunch. &#160;Parking out front (1hr) and behind and to the sides so no real need to use any of the pay lots. With so much pho competition on the same street (I think there are four pho restaurants within a quarter mile stretch), I'm quite surprised that this place received as high of a rating as it did. Coming from a man with pho running through his veins, I can honestly say that this place is just ok. The broth was rather weak and bland, and when it comes to pho...it's ALL about the broth. The decor was nice but not enough for me to pass up trying the other pho places on the same street next time I'm looking for pho in the Capital Hill area.
I have seen the bad reviews but they need to come here for dinner instead of the dim sum. &#160;I have been coming here for many years. &#160;House of Hong Restaurant has a spacious area to hold big parties or big groups of people, many tables with Lazy Susans for lazy and short peeps like me. They also have a parking lot in the ID with a parking attendant who hooks you up with parking. In all fairness, House of Hong cooks traditional Chinese food and you just need to know what to order. We ordered about 10 dishes ( pics) - Fish Maw Egg Drop Soup, Fried Salt &amp; Pepper Squid sitting on top of a Fried Fish shape Bowl, two Peking Duck, Fried Chicken with Shrimp chips, Fried Rice, Kai-Lan (Chinese broccoli) with Oyster sauce, Tofu with crab balls, Seafood Snow Peas &amp; Mix veggies, and Abalone.My favorites of course is the Salt &amp; Pepper Squid and Peking Duck. I love making a sandwich with some crispy duck, sweet plum sauce, little green onion and hot steamy bun. The Salt &amp; Pepper Squid is chinese calamari, nicely spice with a bite of jalapeno and also be able to eat the fried fish bowl...nicely done. All of the food was done with quality and no MSG, hate MSG.Great customer service, never had a problem with any of them since I speak Chinese. Timely refills for water and tea, plus extra napkins for my messy self. &#160;So do come here for dinner! I've never had a good experience or awesome food at House of Hong, but why do I keep on going back there? Am I too optimistic/hopeful?My boyfriend convinced me to have dim sum at House of Hong today, and it was a HUGE mistake! The restaurant wasn't too busy (1:00 pm on Saturday, this should have clued us in...), a baby was screaming, and someone was on a microphone talking and singing very loudly.One of the cart ladies was super pushy and aggressive basically trying to thrusting pot stickers in our face. She begrudgingly stopped only after my boyfriend I both yelled "NO!!" and waved our arms defensively. (She then gave us evil eyes.)I did declare to my boyfriend that I would never ever ever go back to House of Hong ever AGAIN (until someone else convinces me, again...) They lost thier star chef!! :( But they still have thier parking lot. :) although the man directing the parking lot sometimes makes me feel awkward.Dinner is just normal. They make banquet dinners perfectly fine. My favorite part is the dessert that comes out in the shape of a fish. Yummy coconut jelly.Dim Sum is pretty inconsistent. Sometimes the dishes are amazing, and sometimes they are not that great at all. Some dishes are kind of dry. It's kind of weird when they tell me they are going to heat up my food... and it's got saran wrap on it...I like that there is never a wait, but the place is so big I feel wierd when there are not too many people.On a happy note, the waitresses are nice. They always greet me with a smile. There is one lady who is especially nice. She has short hair with glasses. She always looks like she works very hard while with a smile on her face. On Saturday afternoon we tried to get into Harbor City Bar-B-Que and then Jade Garden. &#160;Both places had long lines (full of hungover hipsters) out the door so we headed up to House of Hong. &#160;No lines! &#160;Plenty of seating! &#160;Food to eat! &#160; Okay. &#160;So you totally have to be picky. &#160;Don't grab everything that passes you by. &#160;Don't get the fried stuff. &#160;Wait for the steamed shrimp and cilantro dumplings. &#160;Wait for the pork shumai which appears to have hand chopped pork so there is a delicious texture and obvious pork instead of a ground mystery meat combination. &#160;Then there is that amazing thing with steamed rice noodles and a nice sweet soy sauce. &#160;Make good choices! &#160;Then go lie down. If you want yummy food and a nap afterwards, this place will definitely give you both. &#160;I left House of Hong full, happy, and in a food coma. &#160;Can't wait for next Sunday! When out of towners come to visit, this is usually where I take them for dim sum. "Why?" you ask? well here it is:-very easy to get to-they have their own parking lot-good for groups-fairly priced-dim sum is good (just a touch too oil sometimes, but not all the time)And yes, I know that the ladies with the carts may seem aloof, but you would be too if you had a ton of people staring at you, willing you to stop at their table. Just make sure you go in a group. It may not seem fair, but I think you get more carts passing your way. Good for me, bad for people eating by themselves or in a pair. As far as Dim Sum goes this place is pretty decent. &#160;They have the standard fare and everything comes out at the temp that it should be. &#160; I loved the steamed pork dumpling things and the shrimp balls that have the fried wonton wrappers one them. &#160; The great thing about this place is the price. &#160;When the check came I couldn't believe how cheap it was, under 30 bucks for 4 people. &#160; I was dumbfounded, but it always makes the experience better when you save some dough. &#160; All in all everyone enjoyed it and I will be back again and again and again. I'm always excited about having dim sum in another city, so it was with eager anticipation that we walked into House of Hong while my family and I were exploring Seattle. &#160;Well, we soon encountered disappointment. &#160;The dim sum tasted cold, stale, and not fresh at all. &#160;The woman who served us was nice enough, so the outing was not a total wash. &#160;We always like meeting nice people. &#160;But that is not enough to change the opinion of my taste buds! &#160;Thus , the two star rating. The best thing this place has going for it: &#160;Free parking. &#160;I have mobility issues, so that is a huge plus for me.The service: &#160;Pretty darn good and friendly. &#160;We were seated almost immediately, even though the place was hopping. &#160;And then one of the steam carts approached almost immediately. Food: &#160;We went for Dim Sum. &#160;It was actrually good! &#160;Not great, not bad, but good. &#160;We had siu mai, ha gow, and some other steamed ones. &#160;Then some egg custards and steamed hum bow. &#160; Good!Price seemed pretty reasonable. &#160;We left full and happy. &#160;They were crowded, but we got pretty good service. &#160;The room is nice enough, the bathrooms were newer/cleaner than other International District restaurants.We tried to go to Jade Garden which always get such great reviews.. but there is always a line, and I am unable to stand for long periods. &#160;I was happy to get such immediate service at House of Hong. If your looking for DIM SUM, this is a GREAT place to go. I have been here many many times and always have a great meal. They have lots of different dishes to pick from including vegetarian for those who do not like the seafood or pork options. Usually you can be seated instantly and the staff is very friendly. I go here almost every other week as a Sunday ritual. The dim sum wasn't that great here but the service was fabulous! And they have free parking. I'm a little ashamed to admit that I've been coming here for years, but I will be blaming that on my mother because she always forces us to have brunch here.The service is really terrible. I swear the waitresses do their absolute best to avoid making eye-contact with you and when you do get the chance to ask them for something, they forget (on accident or on purpose perhaps) and then you have to spend another 10 minutes trying to flag them down again. Oh you know, it's cool that I've been here for 15 minutes and you still haven't brought the booster seat I requested for my toddler, she probably enjoys the fact that her view is limited to what's underneath the table. The food itself is average. The fried rice is bland the shumai has a strong aftertaste that I'm not too fond of. The only thing I've ever really LOVED from here is this baked crab with seafood thing they have on occasion. It really is delicious, but they only have it some of the time, which sucks because it's the one thing I look forward to at this place. Yes, there's parking, but if you come around lunch time it's probably full. There are some spots across the street, but if you suck at driving (aka my mother) you will probably hit something as it is very cramped and awkwardly angled. Pretty freaking awesome dim sum if you asked me... Just say no. &#160;Not fresh, not friendly, just not. My friend and I went here after regular dim-sum hours. And we still managed to get dim sum. Yummmm. Maybe because we went when it wasn't too busy that we managed to get fresh dim sum as quick as fresh dim sum can come in. I am actually really surprised at how low the ratings are! I thought the food was good and the service was pretty good as well! What happened to this place? I used to come here a lot when I was a kid. Almost 20 years later I came back to see if anything had changed. The interior widened. The food got worse. You know how you put Asian left overs in the fridge and the next morning the sauce is jiggly because it hardened? Well that's exactly what I got when I ordered dim sum bean curd. Jiggly bean curd. &#160;I was so grossed out I lost my appetite. I don't know how much longer this restaurant will keep up but I'm not coming back. In China Town, you pick your battles. It's either, too grimy, packed, poor service, adequate food, no-parking etc.. That being said this place does have parking, service is friendly-just smile and nod, wait isn't too bad, food is adequate and menu is extensive. This was a last minute option when the regular restaurant I go to for dim sum was too busy and we were on a tight schedule. I was surprised at how much the interior has changed to something nicer and a bit more fancy looking, and unfortunately I don't think it transferred to the food as well. Maybe it's because I grabbed dim sum at 2pm, but the food wasn't that warm when the items we selected were. Maybe it was an off day but I guess this place will remain as a second to last place option. Pro: has some parking if you need it. Con: food isn't as good later into the day. A little pricy, but it's worth it. One star dim sum, seriously. I'm only giving it two because finding parking in Chinatown on Saturday or Sunday morning is a nightmare and House of Hong has free parking. This place is not really even worth describing. I've been going to House of Hong for years... since i was a kid.So, it's a little disheartening to see so many low reviews of the place. My most recent visit was November, 2010. While it was not the best dim sum I've ever had, it was delicious and very consistent. Perhaps it was because we were there early, before the mad, Saturday rush, but all of our items were steaming hot and fresh. Baked pork buns were spot on. &#160;Har gow and sui mai were fresh. Nothing short of exceptional.The only notable con: they charged for tea. That seemed strange, especially since they didn't ask if we wanted it.I did notice that by Noon on a Saturday, it was only half full. I suppose times change and other places have become more popular, but for me, this is everything I expect in a dim sum house in Seattle. I would suggest that there are 4separate requirements that contribute to the success of a Dim Sum outing:- Food variety: not enough food options in my opinion. - Food quality: the food quality was disturbingly sub-par. How is it that a restaurant in the I D can make such tasteless and bland food is beyond me- rude service: let's face it that contribute to a good Dim Sum experience, and on that front they excelled. The guy who was directing us to our table nearly gave my friend a body blow for almost going through the wrong door. - the last and final requirement of a good Dim Sum experience is good company, which we luckily had.I cannot see myself going back to House of Hong.The prices are good, but the food is terrible. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere... I had a pretty disappointing dim sum experience. I haven't been to HoH in a number of years, so it was a bit shocking to see how far this place has fallen. I, too, ventured into HoH due to the long wait time at Jade Garden.Everything that was served to us was just warm. Nothing tasted hot and fresh. I would not recommend this establishment if you would like to eat hot, fresh, and tasty dim sum. Just went to this place yesterday with my sister and a Girlfriend.We were shocked that we were charged $2.25 for TEA. Shouldn't we be notified of that? What place in Chinatown charges for Tea?? Really??Their dishes looked like they were cooked earlier and not fresh, we didn't even touch the shrimp balls that has rice flour covering them. I know their names in chinese but not english sorry.We had a few dishes that were not even touched due to just the look of them. I felt bad for throwing away food when so many are not having enough to eat but I do not believe my stomach would have been happy spending the day over a toilet. I went here from a recommendation from a Girlfriend who said it was a good place to have Dim Sum. This place is so sad. I would have rather gone to Jade Garden or some other place in Chinatown. The sticky pork buns were cold. The servers were nice but she had to heat up some of our orders. The Chinese broccile was cold so she had to reheat that. They only impressive dish I will have to say is the Taro Balls. They are deep fried on the outside and I have to say this was the most impressive Taro that I have had at a dim sum place.I would recommend something else if you really want good and reasonable Dim Sum in Chinatown.Meal came to be $42.00 including tax for only 3 people. I used to frequent this place with my family for Sunday dim sum. I just recently went back on Sunday around 10:30am and surprisingly there was no wait at all compared to what I'm used to. I guess it was fairly early for dim sum so it wasn't very crowded. The downside of going earlier is there were less options available in the foods carts and we had to order and wait. The quality of food was also lacking and some dishes were cold. Overall, I did not enjoy my return visit. I'm not a dim sum connoisseur. I know when it tastes good, and I know when it doesn't, but mostly I just love it all the time. That said, House of Hong definitely isn't one of my favorite places to go, but if you have a lot of people in town and you want to get some relatively cheap and tasty grub on short notice, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better experience than House of Hong. The selection is varied, the food is decent, and the service, while not spectacular, at least doesn't seem to suck too bad when you're with other people.But: Like a few other reviewers have pointed out, don't go alone. The several times I've gone by myself, the service has been...I think the word I'm looking for here is "neglectful." The trolleys never come around, and of course there's the charge for the pot of tea that I didn't ask for and wouldn't be able to finish even if I tried. So: big groups maybe, by myself never again.
I had such hopes for you, Fusion. I live a block away, and I hear promising beats pouring out of your tackily painted up facade often. We could've had something special. But alas, it wasn't meant to be. Where shall I start? Thursday night + 11PM = $20 cover for 18-20 year olds, $10 for 21+. We get marks on our wrist at the entrance ID check, and then another mark on the other wrist inside when we pay our cover.Side note: Even the frat parties I've been to gave me wristbands. I don't appreciate your ugly X's and O's all over my wrists, Fusion. If you MUST resort to cheap sharpies, at least put in the effort and draw a little heart or smiley face or SOMETHING. The inside isn't bad. Good dance space, nice VIP area with booths. The bar area is closed off and guarded by another bouncer. Bad news for my boyfriend, who had to drink alone. ): He was also patted down on the way OUT of the bar area, wtf? The music is acceptable and you can dance to it. Not much to say on that front. Overall an immensely disappointing experience. Like a fellow reviewer said, it's a ridiculous place that's trying to be something it's not. Maybe I'm being unfair-- maybe Thursday nights just aren't your thing, Fusion. But the fact of the matter is that there are plenty of other places in Seattle I can waste a $20 cover on, places that don't insist on feeling up my boyfriend twice in the span of an hour, places with better atmosphere and music, places that won't leave me regretting the marks on my wrists. PS-- does anyone know how to remove marker from skin? ffs. Thinking about Fusion Ultra Lounge just makes me laugh.Drinks are typical, and overpriced. &#160;The dance floor is awkwardly segmented and crowded. &#160;90% of the people there were guys, which would be fine if I wasn't at a club. &#160;The music was awful and didn't encourage dancing. &#160;I think the DJ was being a little too stubborn with his playlist and didn't play to the crowd at all. &#160;The bouncers are pretentious, as is the cover.I think this club probably plays well to those women out there that are looking for a place to have a girls night out. &#160;At the very least, you'll get a bunch of attention from a bunch of desperate dudes.Ultra lounge? &#160;Ultra lame.GET: &#160;Out of there. It was just an awful experience all around. &#160;Being charged a cover to hang out in a place that's 85.7% dudes? &#160;No thanks! &#160;If that's what I was looking for, I'd head to Cap Hill thank you very much.The "DJ" if you could call him that, was one of the worst I've heard, and after listening to just a few minutes of his "mixing" I now know why he is here and not someplace in Belltown or Pioneer Square.I was dragged here by a friend who was looking to try a new place in Seattle, but after my experience here, I'm going to stay home from now on. Atmosphere is great! 4 starsdance floor mediocre 3 starsCash only... 3 starsAlways have great promotions 4 starsSo that is my ratingDrinks are good not really rating them... Dude at the door: "next time, dont wear a black sweater.."Me: WTF? you berious?Dude at the door: Where you from?Me: WTF does it matter?Dude at the door: Lift up your pants, dont start no trouble, this is a nice place, people are here to have funWas i just racially profiled????We finally get in n theres a $10 cover on a thursday night. walk in n get harassed for glow in the dark marker ink on our wrists. come to find out its an 18 and up night.. had to drink in the tiny fenced off beer garden. Bartender chick was pretty and bool, bouncer on the inside was bool, some of the girls were bool, just old boy at the door was something fresh Boo! &#160;I can honestly say that I've never been to this place but I met the owner or manager (don't remember) and he was totally rude. &#160;I would never visit this place.
