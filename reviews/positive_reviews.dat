I had such hopes for you, Fusion. I live a block away, and I hear promising beats pouring out of your tackily painted up facade often. We could've had something special. But alas, it wasn't meant to be. Where shall I start? Thursday night + 11PM = $20 cover for 18-20 year olds, $10 for 21+. We get marks on our wrist at the entrance ID check, and then another mark on the other wrist inside when we pay our cover.Side note: Even the frat parties I've been to gave me wristbands. I don't appreciate your ugly X's and O's all over my wrists, Fusion. If you MUST resort to cheap sharpies, at least put in the effort and draw a little heart or smiley face or SOMETHING. The inside isn't bad. Good dance space, nice VIP area with booths. The bar area is closed off and guarded by another bouncer. Bad news for my boyfriend, who had to drink alone. ): He was also patted down on the way OUT of the bar area, wtf? The music is acceptable and you can dance to it. Not much to say on that front. Overall an immensely disappointing experience. Like a fellow reviewer said, it's a ridiculous place that's trying to be something it's not. Maybe I'm being unfair-- maybe Thursday nights just aren't your thing, Fusion. But the fact of the matter is that there are plenty of other places in Seattle I can waste a $20 cover on, places that don't insist on feeling up my boyfriend twice in the span of an hour, places with better atmosphere and music, places that won't leave me regretting the marks on my wrists. PS-- does anyone know how to remove marker from skin? ffs. Thinking about Fusion Ultra Lounge just makes me laugh.Drinks are typical, and overpriced. &#160;The dance floor is awkwardly segmented and crowded. &#160;90% of the people there were guys, which would be fine if I wasn't at a club. &#160;The music was awful and didn't encourage dancing. &#160;I think the DJ was being a little too stubborn with his playlist and didn't play to the crowd at all. &#160;The bouncers are pretentious, as is the cover.I think this club probably plays well to those women out there that are looking for a place to have a girls night out. &#160;At the very least, you'll get a bunch of attention from a bunch of desperate dudes.Ultra lounge? &#160;Ultra lame.GET: &#160;Out of there. It was just an awful experience all around. &#160;Being charged a cover to hang out in a place that's 85.7% dudes? &#160;No thanks! &#160;If that's what I was looking for, I'd head to Cap Hill thank you very much.The "DJ" if you could call him that, was one of the worst I've heard, and after listening to just a few minutes of his "mixing" I now know why he is here and not someplace in Belltown or Pioneer Square.I was dragged here by a friend who was looking to try a new place in Seattle, but after my experience here, I'm going to stay home from now on. Atmosphere is great! 4 starsdance floor mediocre 3 starsCash only... 3 starsAlways have great promotions 4 starsSo that is my ratingDrinks are good not really rating them... Dude at the door: "next time, dont wear a black sweater.."Me: WTF? you berious?Dude at the door: Where you from?Me: WTF does it matter?Dude at the door: Lift up your pants, dont start no trouble, this is a nice place, people are here to have funWas i just racially profiled????We finally get in n theres a $10 cover on a thursday night. walk in n get harassed for glow in the dark marker ink on our wrists. come to find out its an 18 and up night.. had to drink in the tiny fenced off beer garden. Bartender chick was pretty and bool, bouncer on the inside was bool, some of the girls were bool, just old boy at the door was something fresh Boo! &#160;I can honestly say that I've never been to this place but I met the owner or manager (don't remember) and he was totally rude. &#160;I would never visit this place.
Crow kills that lasagna! It is indeed the best ever (though sadly it has delicious sausage within). Their antipasto plate k's A! the place is very cool, kinda goth, but stylishly so. Their salads are to die for and they've got a full bar and a great wine menu! It gets packed so arrive early or plan to wait around for a while. Didn't quite get it. &#160;The interior is pretty open, and was really crowded and &#160;loud just on a Wednesday night. &#160;Cool wine list, but the food ended up being so so and with a sizable wait. &#160;Nice spot to eat in the neighborhood, but I didn't see any reason to go out of your way. oh my sweet heavenly corn bisque and prosciutto wrapped chicken! I wish there was a 3.5 option 'cause that's what I'd give. The drinks were good (raspberry cosmopolitan = recommended, murder of crows = pretty good). Next was antipasti - manchego cheese that was quite tasty, grilled/marinated red peppers, eggplant, olives, green beans. Also tasty and recommended. I found the entrees not terribly exciting, though. They definitely weren't *bad* but for $23 I want an entree that I'm going to call everyone I know and rave about. The presentation was quite appealing and artistic. One was a pan-seared halibut in tomato-y sauce, the other brussel sprouts, cabbage, wild rice pilaf, mushrooms &amp; walnuts. The dessert, however, was worth notifying others about... chocolate-brandy cake with brandy-vanilla ice cream. The cake was more like a brownie.. all crumbly in your mouth and melty and deeeeelicious. I'd eat dinner somewhere else next time but come here for dessert. Being pecked in the eye by a surly crow is one of my more irrational fears in life. In fact, I pretty much hate most birds, but crows seem to be the most arrogant of them all, the way they strut around the yard, squawking at all the smaller birds as if they are the bosses of the bird world. I mean, they hardly even move out of the way when cars come near. Damn, narcissistic birds.I know this has absolutely nothing to do with the following review, but I just felt I needed to get that out in the open. Because even the name alone is enough to make me think twice before going into a restaurant called Crow. I've seen the movie The Birds, and granted it was mainly about seagulls, but I prefer to keep my distance from modern-day dinosaurs, if I can.Fortunately for me, however, I was not attacked by a crow while eating at Crow. In fact, I was quite distracted by the fabulousness of the food to really notice all the iron crows ominously watching over the dining room. My husband Roth and I went early on a Friday evening without a reservation and snagged a table just under the wire. But our punishment, if you will, for not making a reservation was a time limit on the table. The hostess told us we'd need to be done by 7:15, and would that be enough time? It was just before 6, so we figured more than an hour would be plenty of time. Or else, what would happen, I wondered under my breath. Would we turn into pumpkins?Regardless of the time limit, we settled in for a round of drinks. I ordered the Murder of Crows, or Absolut Mandarin and Citron, Creme de Cassis and fresh lemon, while Roth tried the Belgian farmhouse ale (the actual name escapes me, and it's not listed on their online menu) -- both of which were $7 each. A little spendy for beer served in a red wine glass, but the other beers on the menu were under $5, so we figured the $7 beer must be something special. Roth thought it was really smooth, while my drink was mouth-puckering tart perfection.But the food? My god, the food was sublime. I started with the soup du jour, which was pureed potato and leek with a drizzle of olive oil and sprinkling of fresh herbs on top. It took all of me to keep from licking the bowl, but then I remembered that I was in public. Roth started with the Bartlett pear and bibb lettuce salad, which was dressed in a light vinaigrette and garnished with crumbled stilton and walnuts. Also amazingly fresh and crisp.For our main courses, I ordered the prosciutto-wrapped breast of chicken (apparently, I have no problem eating birds) with green beans and wine reduction sauce, while Roth opted for the daily fish special, which was pan-seared halibut topped with Portobello duxelle on top of sauteed escarole and buerre blanc. I had heard good things about the chicken, and I was not disappointed in the least. I'm thinking that from now on, I will demand that all my food be served in a similar gift wrapping of crispy prosciutto. Yes, even donuts.If we were being picky for the sake of being picky, Roth's halibut special seemed a tad pricey for just six ounces of filet - $22? And served without any sort of starch, all of which were offered on the menu as a la carte items. But my chicken was worth every cent of its $15 price, with or without starch. And also, the food runner who brought the soup and salad did not bring me a soup spoon or offer me any fresh cracked pepper (though, he did offer Roth some for his salad, but flat-out ignored me). But again, just being nitpicky, because truly, the dinner was superb. We finished up just before getting the 7:15 boot, which meant forgoing dessert, but I was so satisfied with my food choices that I couldn't care less. Though, I'm thinking if we'd lingered for even a few more minutes, what with no other open tables for her 7 p.m. reservations, the hostess would've been the one to peck out my eye, as opposed to one of the ornamental crows hanging up around the place as decor. Crow just does everything.... better. Nothing fancy, just really well prepared NW food at reasonable prices with a solid wine list at exceptionally palatable prices. Ordering chicken at a restaurant typically has all the excitement of dating an ex, but Crow's prosciutto wrapped chicken borders on pornographic barnyard bondage. So good, so wrong.... Perhaps the restaurant was a bit over hyped and maybe I was expecting too much, but I really wasn't all that impressed with Crow. &#160;The food was tasty, but to me nothing really stood out as being outstanding or truly unique. &#160;Prices were fair - though its definitely not cheap. &#160;The wine selection was pretty nice - though I must admit it did seem to tilt a little more towards the mid and high end. &#160;That said, the thing that got me the most is that their menu is incredibly small with a total of six entrees. &#160;Which seemed really really low to me. &#160;Also for those who care there isn't a huge amount of parking in the area so for the parallel parking phobic it is something to consider. My Morocon lamb shank was awsome. &#160;Heirloom tomato and bread salad was good and scallop dish was also very good. &#160;However it wasn't mind blowing. &#160;I always have to compare with places in &#160;SF. &#160;It is a bit high for what they offer but for a nice dinner out in Seattle, it was good. &#160;One thing, food was quite salty. The food was darn good.The bartender gal, Jill, not only provided service with a smile, she had a personality, and gave the perfect amount of attention, providing privacy when we needed it, and more beer when I was thirsty.Honey had the steamer with Chorizo and a potato cake side. She devoured both - the sausage was a bit spicy for her palate, so I gobbled up the leftovers.I had a $20 rib and mashers dish. The meat was super tender and fell off the bone, then melted in my mouth. Most of the flavor, however, was found in the gravy.What did not like - leaving the restaurant and smelling like I worked in the kitchen for an hour - ya know, when the stink just sticks to your sweatshirt?Improve the ventilation system, please. Oh, and a few more menu items would be appreciated. A tad pricey.But dammit, the food is EXCELLENT!Friendly staff.I stopped by this place with my realtor after making an offer at a Queen Anne condo. &#160;This was my first time here and I'll definitely be back again.Try the duck/beef stew...
This food is always great!. &#160;I've been coming here for what seems like 20 years now. &#160; It's my wife's favorite place to eat. &#160; The spring rolls are terrific. &#160; The chow mein is awesome. &#160;I like the squid with rice, the beef stew, the vermicelli bowls and the deep fried tofu. &#160;The veggies are always fresh. &#160;The folks working there are very kind and decent. &#160;I must say I have never experienced anything but great food and kind service there. &#160;I have never experienced any of the alleged problems that the lady from CALIFORNIA claims to have had. &#160; Must be a shill for another restaurant. &#160;These folks at Thanh Vi are hard working, and their product is excellent. &#160;Some pansy might have an issue with their bathroom, but toodley fucking doo -- don't come back; more food for me and the rest of us who don't have a huge stick up our ass. &#160; I have eaten here literally HUNDREDS of times, and never had a bad experience. &#160;And I am going to keep coming back. &#160; Park on South Main behind the restaurant, it's the easiest way to get in there.
I've been seeing &#160;Taco Del Mar restaurants around for quite some time, and I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, but this time around I decided it was time for me to give this business a try. &#160;I would hate to know that I was missing out on something good.The University Taco Del Mar in the University District is rather smallish, but it has enough room to accommodate a few sit-down customers, and roomy enough for a few people to form a line at the counter, which is what I did along with a few other hungry people. &#160;The pictures on the wall menu didn't give me a good idea what the portion sizes actually were, but the names of the items along with combos should have been a tip-off to what I should have expected.My turn came to order and I ordered a shredded beef, &#160;mondo-sized burrito that was stuffed with beef, rice, beans, cheese, and pico de gallo, and &#160; I also thought I would still be hungry after that, so I also ordered a second one just to make certain I didn't leave that restaurant still hungry, along with a large soda. &#160;Boy! That was a mistake!The friendly staff finished preparing my order in a VERY short period of time, and I took my food, and drink to a table to eat it. &#160;I unwrapped that first burrito and I swear that thing was huge! &#160;It must have been larger than my whole stomach, but the aroma that wafted out of that burrito was irresistible, so I took a bite, and was rewarded with a wonderful, mouthful of flavor-filled goodness! &#160;That burrito was SO delicious! &#160;It took me a while, but I wolfed that whole burrito down. &#160;My stomach was so full, and very happy.I left Taco Del Mar with a very full stomach, and I knew that the second burrito I carried with me was most likely going to be consumed later for dinner. &#160;I like this place. &#160;Good and plentiful food at a reasonable price prepared in a very efficient, and fast manner. &#160;I plan to go back again when time permits itself.
What do you want from a bar? Pleasant atmosphere, lively but not intrusive, a good beer list, good cocktails, good food, games and small-screen TV and . . . OK, let's get back to the food!Grass-fed beef for hamburgers and chili and steak salad? Thank you, thank you - righteous food, good drink, and an owner who sincerely cares that his customers are happy! My hubby &amp; I are regulars here... and not just because we live less than a block away! It's a small, hole in the wall dive bar... where you might not expect the food to be as great as it truly is! So far we haven't been disappointed with anything we've ordered! The chili is my fav, served with all the right fixins and a slice of the yummiest homemade bread (still can't quite put my finger on what kind it is), it's basically dessert but goes so well with the chili!! The carinitas street tacos are also de-lish... same with the house salad (love the apple slices on top)... hubby has had the buger and loved it, &#160;AND can't forget their Bloody Marys! The bartender makes them from scratch, none of the ready-mix nonsense stuff! We always grab a seat in the main bar, but there is also a downstairs (with pool and darts), as well as an outdoor patio area. Very nice unpretentious neighborhood pub. You can't go wrong with their house burger. Good size grass fed beef patty. No fries available, but you won't miss them with the delicious roasted potato side dish. Small main floor but don't miss the downstairs area. What a great find! &#160;Classic neighborhood bar with great beer selections and very good food. I've been to this bar a few times because it's close to my office. I work with lots of 20-somehtings, but we usually end up going somewhere farther away. When I see a place like this, I'm expecting bar food. I wouldn't mind that they're trying to offer "elevated" after-work eats if they put a twist on traditional bar foods. What would be wrong with an amazing basket of truffle fries?I find the food is ok, but not quite worth the price. The only thing on the menu that I would recommend is the street tacos - otherwise find a restaurant. Ordered the hummus platter, which had way too much lemon. &#160;They didn't have fries; instead they have a bowl of roasted potatoes with some kind of weird brown sugar mayonnaise sauch.
I was staying at the hotel and ended up here a couple times when I was feeling lazy or wanted a drink after dinner when I got back to the hotel.The bar setup is very nice and has plenty of seating and a good view of the place from all seats. The only downside is that the bartender has to serve both sides of the bar so they are constantly moving and were always available when I wanted them.The drink menu was interesting and the selections were well made. The beer selection however did not match up with the drink or wine selections. So don't go here expecting a wide selection of beers.The food menu was not the most creative menu especially at the price point they were charging. That said the things I had were very good. I especially liked the blue cheese risotto croquettes. They were especially good with the red onion jam they were served with.Overall this is a nice place and probably the nicest place very close to the hotel other than the Metro Grill, but if you want something really special there are better options over in Belltown. French fries were okay, but could have been a hit with something like truffle oil. Hummus too spicy. Service ok. &#160;Nice atmosphere. My review is on the happy hour at the bar. Boring formulaic HH food HIGH prices. Juno I really wanted to like you... Your decor is lovely I LOVE the Arctic hotel and you are close to my work. Why did you have to disappoint. Ok so the happy hour food selections Truffle Fries, Sliders and Hummus umm don't they have that at like every other bar in town. Service was good and my drink was correct but $12 for an old fashioned w a mid shelf call burbon umm ya. The food is better and about half the price at Contour and Collins pub has nice atmosphere and an amazing beer selection - next time I am making another choice. I guess if you are in a hotel you feel like you should take advantage of people.
So far this is the only Teriyaki place around Aurora/Greenwood area that I like. The prices are just right, the lady that works there is very nice. She doesn't speak much english, but she is very courteous and is fast with getting the order down.The portions are absolutely insane, too. I order the regular sized chicken teriyaki and it's definitely two meals worth...I can't imagine ordering the larger size. This place is also the only place that serves a salad with their teriyaki that I actually eat. Usually, I will just say "no salad" at other places, because the idea of a plain iceberg lettuce "salad" with italian dressing is never very appetizing to me. But this one is actually really tasty and compliments the rest of the meal well.A couple of months ago I went there and she said to me "Thank you for business...please come back. Business is slow". That broke my heart, because this place is so good. So PLEASE if you have eaten there and like it, go back! Give her some money, because it would be a shame to lose one of the QUALITY Seattle teriyaki places in this economy. I've been coming here since about 1999 or so and keep coming back whenever I get the chance. This is the teriyaki I compare all others to (which is rarely good for the other places). The spicy chicken is my favorite - they use a delicious spicy sauce that they make themselves along with the best teriyaki sauce I've ever tasted. The prices are very reasonable and I've never left hungry. The owners couldn't be nicer which adds the shine to this already magnificent gem.
I first went to West 5 a few years ago and every time I'm back home, I will go out of my way to stop by and say hi to Dean, Dave and the incredibly friendly staff at the West 5. &#160;Granted, if you're on a low carb diet, this might not be the place to eat on a daily basis, but if it's great NW food you're after, belly to the West 5. &#160;The sirloin steak bits as an appetizer is a great way to start out. &#160;Follow up that with the W5 cobb salad (some of the best blue cheese I've ever had) and then to the main course, the meatloaf. &#160;This is no BS meatloaf. &#160;Wrapped in bacon- are you kidding? &#160;If loving this is wrong, then I don't want to be right. &#160; Follow that up with the Coconut rave cake and a "Northwest Passage" (a homemade buttered rum recipe and fresh coffee) this is and overload of the senses. &#160;You have to try it. &#160;You'll thank me later. With lots of friends in W Seattle, we land here quite often when we want to meet &amp; have good food, cocktails &amp; comfy conversation. I have found the service hit or miss (not bad, but sometimes just not so friendly), but the food (definitely NOT lo cal - but you HAVE to try the mac &amp; cheese) has always been great &amp; the drinks delicious. They have lots of speciality drinks, but pour great basics &amp; have a decent (small) wine list. (Also you can hop on the wireless from a coffee place nearby). Astral Mac and Cheese, need I say more?Decent happy hour.Too bad the place this past summer smelled like the Seahawks' locker room - chesse toes, anyone - because this place is a great alternative to the bustling crowd across the street at Matador.
You could not drag me back to this place. I was hungry in between errands and was drawn in by the "Vegetarian Food" sign. There are only three vegetarian options on the menu. I ordered one, the #40, thin rice noodles with fresh vegetables, peanuts, topped with a fried egg. As I was sitting waiting for my food I made the mistake of looking around. Straight ahead of me was a large fish tank. I was admiring the huge beta fish, thinking how big they were for such a small tank, when I realized that there was one sunk to the bottom, dead, it's cold eyes staring at me and the other fish trying to move it. I watched it like a car crash until I almost thought I was going to vomit.The food arrived quickly and was only a little less horrifying. The fried egg was fine, you can't really mess that up, but the "fresh vegetables" were discolored carrots and thin skimpy strips of cabbage. The menu advertises things such as broccoli but there wasn't a floret to be found on my plate. The noodles may well have been recycled from another unhappy customer, who like me left most of their meal on their plate, because they were overcooked and tired. There was literally no sauce on this dish: no taste whatsoever. I used the handy tray of hoisin, soy sauce, and sriracha to give it a generic flavor, ate the egg and the fried tofu, and got the hell out of there, barely keeping down the food I had paid far too much for ($9). The pho at this place is by far the worst I've ever had. &#160;I ordered a beef pho and when the bowl came out, I knew right away that eating it was going to be an unpleasant experience. &#160;The color of the broth was very light, extremely atypical of any beef broth I've seen. &#160;There was not a hint of anything that could be called pho because there was no scent of cinnamon, anise, or cloves. &#160;The flavor of the broth tasted as it looked, flavorless, watery, gross. &#160;I plucked all my basil leaves, squeezed all the lime, tossed in all the jalapeno slices, and poured in hoison and chili sauces to make my lunch go down easier, but unfortunately, I could only muster three bitefuls. &#160;I also ordered eggrolls, which were served with some kind of Chinese style sweet and sour sauce. &#160;It was disgusting to say the least. I asked the server for a side of the lime fish sauce that usually accompanies eggrolls. &#160;The sauce helped me eat some of the eggrolls and then I poured the remainder of the sauce into the pho to see if it would taste better...and it did not. &#160;Still very hungry and full of regret, I got up, quickly paid and left. &#160;It may seem unfair that I judged this restaurant on one dish, but if you own a Vietnamese restaurant, the only expectation is for you to do one thing well, and that is pho. &#160;Someone who cooks pho well will do everything else well. &#160;If you can't make pho propertly, then don't own a Vietnamese restaurant. The place is "huge" but there were only a couple of customers on a weekday night. &#160;The egg rolls tasted like they microwaved the frozen ones - not hot and crispy and I'm not sure what the fillings were. &#160;The chicken pho was sub par too.This place looks like a Vietnamese restaurant but it can only fool the newbies. I had heard mixed reviews about New Saigon so I put off visiting even though I am a big fan of Vietnamese cuisine. My friend convinced me to go there for lunch the other day so I finally decided to try it. I ordered the tofu spring rolls and vietnamese crepes. It was awesome. I was pleasantly surprised at how great the flavor of all of the food was. I will definitely be making my way back there. The prices were reasonable. The staff was a little slow and uninterested in their customers but besides that it was a good lunch experience.
The Pho here is pretty good, maybe even the best in the International District. I have also tried some of their non Pho items - beef stew, those rolls with peanut sauce (I forget what they are called - those are excellent as well.Service is quick and the food is consistently tasty. I don't really have any complaints other than the tables with are awkwardly placed far too close together. It's hard to leave after eating tasty Pho when there's barely any room to walk out. No complaints here. I would go again.
1. Location (3 of 5) - Their location is so-and-so, I won't be surprised if they'll have a few customers because it's more than a hundred meters walk from the closest business offices there. &#160;But I do hope that wouldn't cause them to close, they're good. I can't comment on the parking because I usually go there if I go by bus.2. Environment (4 of 5) - Their place is a little bit run-off-the-mill. &#160;The place is something that you would expect a middle class family/business home would look like in 3rd world countries; no sufficient lighting, the ventilations are ceiling fans, and the air-conditioner is poor... but the magic of it, you get this authentic feeling of ethnic presence, that's why I give a 4 of 5.3. Food preparation (5 of 5) - Of all Gyros I've tried in the Seattle/Bell area, they have the most 'accessories' that comes with the plate. &#160;Flavored rice, the feta sauce (I don't know what it's called), Hummus with an olive and olive oil dressing, vegetables, well cooked lamb/beef, the pita bread, are all awesomely arranged in a sizable plate.4. Food taste &amp; flavor (5 of 5) - Just as I described earlier, it's one of the best tasting Gyros around. It's flavorful, the spices are just right, it's not oily, and it's not too salty either.5. Price (3.5 of 5) - Well, because the food is so good, I can accept the price of more than $10. &#160;Yes, it's not that cheap. If you're in a budget, you might want to go somewhere else.6. Employees (4 of 5) - They're not very well dressed, which I really don't mind. They don't have waiters, and most of the time I order straight on the cashier and then get a table, but they don't mind serving the food to your table once it's ready. They're nice and friendly, and they put up a good conversation. &#160;(Mistook me once as a Greek man, haha!)...Simply put, the best gyros In Seattle. For now. The fries are average, but the gyro was delicious. Still pretty busy around the end of lunch rush hour. Dang that gyro was delicious. The restroom needs some work... I think it was out of towels and soap. When you eat inside, despite how spacious it is and upstairs and stuff, you will see a diverse crowd.... and, Oh. No, &#160;a family sat across from me who's toddler loved playing drop-their-food-on-the-floor-because-it's-fun. Dang that gyro was delicious. Also select wall locations showing the Free WiFi details and number. Rather messy bussing action. Be patient when waiting during busy rushes.And dang, that gyro was delicious. You'll walk in, order and pay at the counter, and find a table. You'll grab your own napkins and silverware around the corner. &#160;They play the smooth Jazz station...reminds me of the dentist. The food portion is huge; you might want a to-go box. The tables are clean and the guy at the counter is friendly. The atmosphere is clean and uncluttered. &#160;It's definitely better than Main St. Gyros. Same quality of Zaina's. More expensive than Mediterranean Mix. Had a falafel sandwich here, and they made it extra crunchy by putting fries in it!The only drawback here is that you have to bus your own table, but for about $10 for two sandwiches, it's not that surprising. I would probably only go here for lunch and not dinner, as it is in a shady bit of downtown, and I imagine the street is pretty empty at night, with no businesses across the way either. I agree with those four stars...Nothing to look at but food's good. I work near by, so end up going here when I am tired of the Asian places in ID. &#160;I stick to the chicken gyros, and they are certainly good. &#160;I've had better hummus than what they serve there and the pita bread is a little cold.The place is run of the mill, simple place with ample seating and friendly staff. &#160;It is a little pricey, but it's a welcome change and stands out from all that ID has to offer. &#160;The location is weird and I assume they close at 6 once the offices nearby close, I can't imagine me going there late just because it is so isolated and in an empty part of town. Some very yummy kebabs, falafel, and fattoush. &#160;The hummus could be slightly improved upon. one of the best shawarma in seattle, a must try
Came here to satisfy the I-haven't-eaten-yet-and-I'm-getting-angry" hunger, hence, Indian food for breakfast, but we were here around lunch time.The place is pretty fancy feeling with a fully stocked bar. &#160;(If anyone from the LBC is reading this, it reminded me of Eclipse back in the day).We had the option to eat from the buffet, but they never have vindaloo anything according to the bf, so we ordered from the menu.We both love lamb, so the bf got the lamb vindaloo and I ordered lamb biryani. &#160;For an appetizer, we opted for the calamari which turned out to be the best calamari either one of us has ever eaten! &#160;I don't know my Indian food spices at all, but whatever was in the batter just made the those rings of rubbery squid taste heavenly!Our entrees, too, were bomb! &#160;They were served in the typical little family-style copper pots, but there was really no sharing between us cuz I turn up the heat on my food and the bf get his stuff mild. &#160;He, however, remarked that more often than not, restaurants fail to find his idea of mild. &#160;The chef that day found it.This was the 2nd time I had ever had biryani and I loved it. &#160;We also tried the spinach, which was interestingly delicious.I would like to come here some time for dinner and see what the night-time vibe is like. &#160;It was pretty chill during a Saturday day.Service was good. &#160;The prices are a little on the high side compared to a meal I had had on the eastside which included impeccable wait service, but the verdict is that I would definitely come again and most likely partake in some of the house libations! Just an update to highlight two items we order often and LOVE:1. The tomato soup. Harish and his chefs add cilantro and this just adds such a nice depth of flavor to the tomato soup that it brings it to a whole new level of taste-buds-singing deliciousness.2. The mango lassi. Good lord, this is one of those foods/drinks that if I had to live on it alone for the rest of my days, I could, and happily would. WOW. They make an amazing lassi here. Chutney's is an usual restaurant.The space has the feel of a large cocktail lounge minus the barflies and happy hour crush. Not quite what I expected for an Indian restaurant.We went primarily to try the organic menu. Nice to see a restaurant putting an emphasis on that.The food wasn't very memorable though. It certainly wasn't bad, but the flavors didn't really pop, the portions were fairly small and the prices (understandably) higher for the organic fare.We ordered our dishes in the medium-spicy range, which apparently means not spicy at all. I've tasted yogurts with more heat than the curry we got.Service as others have noted is... minimal. Bordering on annoyed you're there.It was an odd experience to say the least. My friend recommended the buffet and really liked the food, so I came one weekend for their brunch buffet, but I was pretty disappointed. I found most of their selection to be pretty bland and mediocre. I can't think of a single dish that stood out. I've definitely been to better Indian buffets. I suppose if we had ordered from the menu, we could have chosen more flavorful food, but with better options for Indian food, we probably won't be coming again. Organic, non greasy,delicious Indian food. Great atmosphere clean and full of natural light. Buffet. I am a vegetarian. Usually, I do not hope for much when I go to North Indian restaurants. I went to the buffet with medium expectations. Thankfully it has some very good vegetarian options -- bengan bharta, kadai paneer were very good. Naans were very soft and nice. Daal and herbs potato were fine. There were plenty of vegetables (salad) and fruits to choose from. They have very good puddings and sweets too. Thumbs up to this restaurant. I took my friend here for her birthday dinner, since she has a love for Indian food. I had heard great things about this place. The place was very clean and parking was a breeze. The service was okay, a bit awkward, they didn't smile too much. The food was rather disappointing. I ordered the mixed grill, this was suppose to come with an assortment of chicken lamb and shrimp. It was mostly chicken, a few pieces of lamb and one piece of shrimp on a bed of peppers and onions. The meat had a funny taste and was pretty dry. I also ordered some Naan which was pretty standard, the Kulcha Naan was very good. My friend ordered Lamb Rogan Josh a specialty lamb dish, which was too sweet which came with a salad that was equally as sweet. They were nice enough to bring a free dessert with a birthday candle in it, I think it was cheesecake but I wasn't sure, it was so dense it was hard to swallow and had an unsettling texture and flavor. Sighhhh, I have had wayy better Indian food for less elsewhere, this place was just blahh. I love their lunch buffet. I would go every week if I had more money. Servers are not really friendly though... 11am to 230pm is their lunch buffet time! Definitely should be the only time I go! 8.95 for all you can eat! Love it! Chutney's Bistro is really yummy! &#160;Their lunch buffet is a great deal and has a lot of variety. &#160;We usually come here for dinner and the food is excellent. &#160;Great for large groups.The meat in their dishes is always very lean (not stringy or fatty) which makes them so much better. &#160;I love the chicken vindaloo, chicken masala and reshmi seekh kebabs. &#160;Saag paneer and chana masala are excellent veggie dishes. &#160;The owner, Harish, and staff are very friendly too which makes a visit here a very enjoyable experience. &#160;The restaurant is super clean and when the weather is nice, they have a wonderful outdoor area with tables in front. &#160;A great neighborhood spot. Great Food and it tastes even better during the lunch buffet. Free parking, nice atmosphere, and okay service. (This review is based on their Sunday buffet)This buffet is probably great for vegetarians but they are limited in their meat items. &#160;I think there were only 2-3 meat dishes and although I believe their sign advertised that they had lamb in their buffet, there was none.It's definitely an upscale Indian restaurant and the interior looks very nice. &#160;Will think about going back for their regular menu.
I'm always looking for a good place to sing karaoke. This is one of them. Drinks are cheap. Food is delicious. And it's laid back and fun. I shall return!
From now on, this is going to be my spot for my Vietnamese sandwiches. With their extra portions, and value - it's worth it! Their rolls are better too. I came here around '96 as this was one of the originals in Seattle, and the owners split, and I've been going to their location for years; until the last few times the owner there was outright rude. Dude, if I'm spending my hard earned cash - and I don't care if it's only $3.00 - be nice to me. Saigon Vietnam Deli is awesome, with good food, and appreciative service. Go here for your bahn mi's!Tip: my favorite: chicken, with pate added. Service very fast and friendly Sandwiches very cheap $2.50 BBQ pork sand which amazing will take cilantro out of my sand which Cheap egg rolls I crave these sandwich's They take card and if you buy over $40 worth of stuff the will deliver I often frequent this place whenever I'm at work, looking for something inexpensive, yet good to eat.This place is very, &amp; I can see why. I have had the $4 "Lunch Box", &amp; BBQ pork sandwich from this Saigon Deli. Man is it good! You def would not be wasting your money if you came here.It's usually the busiest during lunch hours (10am-1pm), but the service is quick, &amp; they get you out fast with what you want &amp; at a affordable price. Can't ask for much more than that. AHHH! Authentic Vietnamese food made by vietnamese ladies! It's cheap, it's good, and lot of sweet and savory varieties. Their sandwiches are big portioned and pretty cheap too. I love the coconut desserts...those were too yummy and good to eat during the hot ass summer. Make sure you bring cash, they don't take credit card. Of all the places in Chinatown, this is my favorite place to buy authentic Vietnamese sandwiches. The prices are cheap and it's delicious. What else can I say? They also have other dishes there that are just as cheap and tasty!Why not other places for Viet sanwiches?Well... Seattle Deli is too salty with way too much soy sauce and the pate isn't good at all. As for Sub stand, although it is good, it's not a true Viet sandwich. If you're looking for good sandwiches..sub sandwich is fine..but it ain't viet homie! This little place makes me so happy! The location may seem a little sketchy to some... but the price and quality of the food is completely worth venturing in. It is a very small little deli, and everything is made to-go. The Vietnamese sandwiches are awesome and so cheap. &#160;My favorites are the BBQ pork and the chicken. The sandwiches come with jalapenos, cucumber, cilantro, and a shredded carrot/daikon mixture. &#160;I like to ask for all of the veggies on the side so that I can add them to my liking.The hot food is also delicious and amazingly inexpensive. There are a lot of Viet sandwich eaters in my life, but none of them seem to come to this particular shop to get their fix. Fools. Being a Caliornian Viet (meaning, from one of the biggest Vietnamese diasporas), I have high sandwich standards. The bread must be crusty on the outside, but not too dry and flaky. The innards must be moistened with homemade-like mayo, pate, or maggi (or some combo of the like). The whole experience is juicy, crisp and meaty. The sandwiches from Saigon Vietnam Deli definitely meet this standard. Plus, the people working there are always super sweet. They always ask if I know where they're located when I call in my order, which is a line they've probably found useful with 2 other Viet delis within a block. (Note: their storefront faces 12th, though the address is on Jackson.)They have the other Viet deli standards as well, though I haven't gotten around to trying them yet. You can seriously feed yourself for under $5 here. &#160;I had their pork banh mi and shrimp spring rolls for $4.50. &#160;It was good but I thought the sandwich was salty and the spring rolls were not well wrapped. &#160;They fell apart when I picked them up. &#160;They also have a hot line that I want to try when I stop by again. The Banh Mi combo for $2.50 &amp; shrimp spring rolls for $2.00 was definitely a bargain. But the sandwich was a bit on the salty side. Both the pickled veggies &amp; meat were salty. &#160;I ended up 7/11 buying a Super BIg Gulp 10 minutes later. Very solid Vietnamese sandwich. A little too much bread for the filling but and awesome value at 2.75. I thought they would be small at that price so I got two, which was totally unnecessary.
Brad needs to rein it in a little bit with his ingredients. &#160;Each dish on his menu had anywhere from 6-10 listed ingredients that only led to an over-complicated and, unfortunately in the case of my seafood risotto, over-seasoned plate of food. &#160;The chef obviously loves and knows his flavors, but including everything that was fresh at the market that day is not the best approach. &#160;By expanding the menu this obviously talented chef will be able to more readily highlight the amazing shellfish and other seafood that I found at Brad's last night at dinner. &#160;The waitress did a great job listing off the specials and answering my questions about the source of all that seafood. But I found that the dizzying combinations led to making choices very difficult. &#160;I love crab in risotto, but not necessarily whole scallops. &#160;But I wouldn't mind scallops as an option in a plate of pasta. &#160;And why the whole chicken sausage AND whole pork sausage in one linguini dish? &#160;You have two great sausages, you're using the same imported linguini (not sure why that's imported) in most of your pasta dishes, and thus you should be able to make another sauce that can compliment one sausage meat, and another that compliments the other. It was all too heavy handed. &#160;You are a wonderful chef with a great restaurant. &#160;Simplify your ingredients, expand your menu to possibly highlight the local seafood, and stop trying to layer each plate of food with more ingredients necessary. &#160; Beyond the food, the decor is a bit thrown together with baseball memorabilia on one wall that made it seem like I was in Brad's man-cave (Yankees? Really??) and an ongoing conversation criss-crossing across the room between three tables who felt the need to engage one another over my date and I's dinner, making us feel like we had little intimacy. &#160;This was compounded awkwardly by the woman sitting to my immediate right breast-feeding her newborn sans blanket/covering. &#160;No problem with public breastfeeding, just not stoked on seeing a stranger's boob while eating my $25 plate of seafood risotto. &#160;Not a great date spot for that reason, which is sad because the food was so rich and the wine list lending to what could have been a very romantic evening. We LOVE Brad's. &#160;Always have amazing food, delicious wines, and great service. &#160;It does feel like you're eating in Brad's personal dining room. &#160;Got to try the Aglio e Olio!! I took my girlfriend out to dinner here on Sunday. I had purchased a Groupon for the place and to be honest I was disappointed. For two glasses of wine, two dishes and a shared salad, I felt $80 was overpriced. My dish wasn't even good and I could only end up eating about half of it. I asked for a dry red, she gives me something that tastes of Shiraz. The lights were always dimming. This place was jenky. I'd give it a 3/5 if it wasn't for the fact that the mouse-over says "A-OK" and well, my experience wasn't okay. My favorite place to eat dinner. Cozy, small, unique. Great rustic Italian food with Brad's own flair. The aligio olio is always great especially with fresh crab. The special sheet is fantastic too. Just had the lamb and venison tonight and it was amazing! To be clear, I don't want to hand out 5-star ratings like candy - they should be only given to the best of the best, right? &#160;Perusing through the other ratings of the Swingside, it's hard to disagree with the negatives: average wine list (with marginal by-the-glass selections), casual service (which can be good or bad depending on your expectations), ambiance that hasn't changed since perhaps the 80's (and wasn't particularly thoughtful when unveiled). &#160;Presentation of food is unspectacular as well.So... 5 stars for that?? &#160;Yes! &#160;Here's why, and I'll write it again and again on Yelp. &#160;Here is the recipe for the New Seattle Restaurant: (1) Gorgeous build-out of old garage/warehouse with exposed brick to create a 3.5-star ambiance.(2) Extensive, somewhat overpriced wine list with extensive, overpriced original cocktails(3) The words "local", "organic", and "foraged" everywhere, but with no real backup to the causes(4) Gregarious if somewhat emotionally detached service(5) In the end, TWO STAR FOOD!I know, I know - I don't personally review places solely based on food. &#160;I'm a sucker for all of those other facets that make up the dining experience as well. &#160;But here's the deal: Swingside makes the best Italian food in all of Seattle. &#160;Period. &#160;Brad's personal story is well-detailed so I won't re-hash it here. &#160;The dude can cook. &#160;It's clear that every order is made from scratch right then, of high-quality ingredients across the board, and contain fistfuls of garlic, capers, fresh herbs and whatever it takes for a pungent, well-balanced incredible meal. &#160;I love this place. Killer Italian for a decent price. Best wine list in town for your money! This place is friendly, homey, and the food is good. &#160;Brad and the staff are incredibly nice, and they let us stay late, even though they were done for the night and having a staff dinner in the restaurant. &#160;(Brad has nice pets that come out to play, too!) &#160;Good prices, mains are around $20, salads around $14. &#160;Wine was good. &#160;Had a dandelion salad that was excellent, and a beef stew that hit the spot in the cold weather. &#160;Pasta dishes went over well with the others. &#160;They don't take reservations, which is kind of nice and takes the pressure off of having to be somewhere, but can be a little crowded if there's nothing open. &#160;Luckily there are bars in the neighborhood, so there's no excuse not to go enjoy dinner, and maybe a pre-dinner drink along the way. I sit writing this review eating leftovers of Wild boar and Venison bolognese. Tasty, glorious, finished with a touch of cream. A traditional menu item and worth every second. Savory and meaty but not thick and heavy.The hazelnut pesto is another of my favorites. Light cream, a bit nutty with pesto foundation on a linguine bed. YUM. The swingside was recommended by a friend and is a spot that the gentleman friend and I frequent. We love the homey quaint atmosphere, neighborhood feel and excellent service. A lot of special items are available and we've tried an assortment but stick to our two favorites listed above. Wonderful little place, fills up and has glorious salted rosemary bread and oil appetizers served a plenty, included in the meal.If you're looking for a high fine dining experience, do not look here. I f you want a cozy local feel with the HIGH quality service and ingredients, please walk through the door. Be prepared to pay for your meal, good food is pricey for some, but 2 glasses of wine, appetizer and 2 entrees runs around $70. Very accurately priced for the attention and quality. My husband and I discovered this little gem in Fremont. It is a cozy cottage-like setting. The server was very knowledgeable about wine and brought me 2 tasters based on my preferences. The meal was OUTSTANDING! My husband got the venison and wild boar bolognese which he describes as the best thing he's ever eaten in his life. My linguine and clams were quite good also, but I was secretly jealous of the bolognese... Wonderful service, atmosphere and food! I've been a fairly avid yelp follower for a while now and have never quite felt compelled to sign up and "write a review"..... &#160;until this place. I had the aglio olio with crab on the top of it. It was fantastic. Absolutely Fantastic. They didn't have the wine we ordered but gave us a better bottle for the same price (appreciated). Our server was admittedly new and so sweet, she did a fantastic job and I loved the place inside. So why not five stars?? Our sweet server told us that the place used to be a cute little house (obviously) and still pretty much was behind the restaurant so we decided to go down the (publicly accessible) alley and look at the back. As we were looking up near the fence talking, one of the chefs (I had seen him in the back) walked up from the rear of us (toward the restaurant) and quite abruptly locked the gate near us as though he was worried we were going to break in or something?? I told him we had just eaten there and thought the food was fantastic and were just looking at the architecture from the side, he said he wasn't the owner and walked away inside. Humph.Still absolutely fantastic food. I will definitely go again...when I feel like splurging, this place seemed to be a little more like $$ and a half :) I'd heard but now I've tasted! It was hard to contain ourselves over there in the corner. Each bite was transcendent. Both dishes ~ Pollo con something with farfalle pasta. The other dish was from their specials ~ it had sausage and polenta and it was heavenly! THE Brad himself brought out the second masterpiece. I only knew that because I asked. It felt like it was filled with regulars. Like a neighborhood dining room where you go when you would like a little connection with others along with your entree.No room to sit when we got there but we walked a few blocks north to Rialto for a cocktail until she phoned us for our table. I recommend it. I came here armed with a Groupon. &#160;We split the Carlton salad and then we ordered a pasta each. &#160;The salad was really, really, really good despite being slightly overdressed. &#160;It seemed like they threw bits of everything fresh in there - grapes, figs, pears, olives, red peppers, walnuts, goat cheese, and at least 5 other things I don't remember. &#160;After the salad, I was eager to try their house specialty, the Aglio Olio - and I was disappointed. &#160;Like the salad, the list of ingredients was long, including anchovies, hazelnuts, sun dried tomato, garlic, and cheese but it was all melded together instead of having separate interesting bits. &#160;The portion was massive, and there was enough for 2 meals for a big eater like myself. &#160;The first two bites were great - garlicky, savory, creamy, and rich - but then it became too much. &#160;My boyfriend ordered the clam pasta with white sauce and he seemed to enjoy it, but he also didn't think that it was that special.I thought prices were a bit on the high side - it cost $75 for the two of us before the Groupon. &#160;I understand that they use premium, fresh, and organic ingredients, but this was only apparent in the salad. &#160;The pasta dishes were lacking. &#160;I just don't think that I can justify these prices in Seattle when there is plenty of cheaper and equally good food available.Service was good though. &#160;Our server was very knowledgeable on the menu, offering suggestions and recommendations. &#160;I also liked how he told us the prices of the specials without us asking him. With all of the positive reviews, we were really looking forward to Brad's Swingside Cafe'. The setting was quaint and cozy. We arrived on the earlier side, before the dinner rush, so getting a good table wasn't an issue. We figured that this would translate into attentive service, but we were wrong we waited and waited and waited. The food? Surprisingly uninspired. My wife ended up bringing her whole meal home to compost because she didn't want to insult them. Oh well, we tried it. I have been eating at Brads restaurant for nearly 20 years and have never been disappointed. The past decade I have resided out of state but every time I came to visit Seattle I was sure to stop by and feast on Brads delicious meals, my favorite is the Brindisi. &#160;I simply can not get enough of his good food, the atmosphere is cordial and comfortable and the prices are extremely reasonable. I have been a "foodie" for decades, &#160;and I highly recommend his restaurant.Viva Italia!
Went here on a Sunday (note, they only serve breakfast on weekends). This place is also changing names to the Bryant Corner Cafe.We didn't have super high expectations, but we wanted to give it a shot. The restaurant is nothing special, and it was really crowded with only one waitress. The hostess was responsible for filling waters, which she did not do so well at. Our food came out and the lady that brought it out brought it to the wrong table. Our waitress was nice but did not follow up with us because she was too busy--I know it's a small restaurant, but they need at least two DEDICATED servers, not a waitress and then some random kitchen staff that pops their head out the door. I had a pumpkin spice latte and had no complaints. We both had the Sunflour breakfast with eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage and pancakes. Nothing special about the breakfast--except for the pancakes. I don't really like eating pancakes at restaurants--they're usually too heavy and lack any flavor other than whatever was just on the grill. These pancakes, however, were amazing. We had to ask for extra syrup (the pancakes are huge, how is a tiny thing of syrup expected to do the pancake justice?) but other than that the pancakes were so, so good. If I go back, it'd be during the week, not the busy hours, etc... the service would have been much better if they had more staff. However, I would go back for the pancakes... so amazing. IOur waitress did not charge us for the drinks because we had to ask for refills--that was nice of her and she didn't have to do that, so we appreciated it.
Great food. The chicken salad wrap was yumm. So fresh but they ran out of it half way putting my order together?? Weird so they ask if I wanted to add something else in my wrap. The quiche was okay....but I had it cold, prob better if I warmed it up. The ice teas were good.The service was soooo slow....But very friendly people. Finally, they opened!This Cherry St. Coffee House is located at southwest corner of the Douglas Apartments along 12th ave., just a block up from Ba Bar. &#160;What I really enjoy about this place are the large windows that allow for a ton of natural lighting as well at the study-size tables (not sure about wifi and outlets though).Being a coffee lover, I do have my preferences (light to medium roasts), but I'm always down to try something new. &#160;Cherry St. carries an espresso blend (medium roast) with coffees from Center and South America, and a little from &#160;Papau New Guinea (per their website). &#160;As a drink it and write this review, it is on the lighter side with hints of chocolate.The staff was friendly and helpful, I will be back soon. I purchased a Groupon for this cafe and tried it out today - I'm definitely going back for more! I ordered a Ham and Cheddar sandwich and it was the BEST sandwich I've probably ever had! The staff was extremely nice and helpful. I recommend this to anyone who wants some delicious food, and the sandwich was so big &#160;- I can only eat half at a time!I gave it 4 stars beaus I thought the price is a bit high but I think it's within the usual range of this are. Regardless, I'm definitely going back! Great place, love the green tea here....Cherry Love I stopped in this new location just to check it out today and I am already a fan! The staff was super helpful and friendly. I got a delicious latte and a super yummy chicken salad sandwich on pita bread. I am so happy to have such a great coffee place so close to campus! My only complaint is with the set up of the building. Although I absolutely love the large windows, the space felt really crowded by the cash register as there really wasn't a distinct line to stand in and a lot of people were there for lunch. I will certainly be back Cherry Street Coffee House!
The W hotel bar atmosphere is sex...good looking people, laughing, drinking...bodies swaying to the music...nice cocktails...I know there is some hot action going on upstairs in this hotel after you visit the bar....game on!!! The drinks here are sexy. The glasses on the frou frou drinks are rimmed with sugar, perfect for licking off, licking your lips of that sweetness. My favorite one being the rose drop. Pair that with sexy fries.. the saltiness of those fries paired with the sweetness of the drink.. Makes you feel like you just had a mouth orgasm. I love coming here every once in a while as it's not cheap but its fun to live the life of someone from a different city say... NYC, say... SATC... but once you leave, you realize you are still in Seattle. My tab was paid for via expense report, so I shant complain about the prices here. I had no idea that Seattle was such a chic place. We came on a Wednesday night during the happy hour - thankfully got there EARLY and got a table, otherwise we would have waited in a huge line. Drinks were strong &amp; sexy, and snacks were chi-chi and delicious. Thank you, W Hotel, for making me feel sort of like a celebrity, even if for 2hrs. Cozy, and shiek with high back sofas and comfy leather loungers. We wanted to have appetizers but ended up only having wine. &#160;This is a definite go back on my list for more sampling of both food and drinks. &#160;I went on Sunday evening and it was pretty calm on the homefront. &#160;Wait staff were super friendly funny and the energy reminded me of bars on the Westside of Los Angeles. &#160;This is not your typical TGI Friday's place to go for food and drinks so if you want something different, check it out! This place gets a thumbs up from me!
The staff were nice, but the wraps were average. I think we come in here expecting a lot since it's inside one of the best outdoors stores ever.My Bombay wrap had nothing to do with Bombay, (no curry even as the menu said) but it tasted fine. Tortilla soup was delish. Smoothie was alright. Surprised by all of the mediocre reviews here, as it contrasts pretty significantly with my experience. I've tried the spicy shrimp burrito and the teriyaki bento box, and both came very hot, fresh, and were very flavorful. Prices are very good as well and service was fine. And of course, you're at the top of the flagship REI store, overlooking a beautiful view of the outdoor complex and the NE tip of the city.
Cool divey Irish pub in Greenwood. &#160;They offer a VERY LIMITED menu so don't expect to eat here. &#160;Not having a real menu available is probably the only downside to The Ould. &#160;It's a dive bar so I don't expect much of this place anyway.They have live music on the weekends but The Ould is usually slow during the week. &#160;I prefer this place over other bars in the north Greenwood area. &#160;They have better bartenders than most North Greenwood pubs (especially during the weekdays) and live music is always a plus. They also have a covered outdoor patio which is nice. This place is worth a visit if you are in the area. This is a cute little dive... with some of the most original bathroom grafiti I have ever seen.I like this place just fine it's older the stage is rickety, the dancefloor is teh same way, the patrons are varried and the bartenders and pretty nice considering the bitter lives we all lead. The music is usually fun and they have a pretty nice beer list not to mention blackthorne cider on tap last time i was there which made me smile.All in all I'll come back when I'm in the area, a fun little place to hang out with friends. I want to share that Tracey, after reading my review and scathing comments, found a way to contact me and personally apologize. Even if it was a year and a half later, I really did appreciate this. I wish her, and the Triangle all the best!
Everything about this place is sweet-sweet staff, sweet location, sweet name (from the underrated Will Ferrell gem, Stranger than Fiction) and baby, SWEET treats. I am not lying, exaggerating or making up stories when I tell you that the almond croissant I had made my eyes cross, my knees go weak and my soul do a little dance. I drool even now, weeks later, remembering it's honeyed, crispity-crunchity exterior, and flaky, butter-filled insides, all the while inhaling the scent of almonds. Yes, you can love an inanimate baked good, I have proof. (3.5 Stars) Great location, great atmosphere. &#160;Bright, airy, enough seating but not crowded, and no blaring music that otherwise drowns out conversations - which is important here because you'll want to sit for a while and chat. &#160;Service was excellent: friendly and very accommodating from start to finish. &#160;Maybe it was time of day, but the baked good offerings were only about a dozen, which considering they all looked very delicious and "hand crafted", wasn't such a bad thing after all. &#160;I was equally pleased that it wasn't a bunch of clone items (muffin a, muffin b, muffin c, etc.), but a very diverse offering. &#160;The few we opted for were fresh, just the right sweetness, and very satisfying.But I'm knocking the stars down a little because the coffee was horrible. &#160;I'm guessing it was the choice of roasts, but instead of a deep, smooth pull, the shots were highly acidic and tangy, making for an unsatisfying espresso and a weak Americano. &#160;Not an element that will keep me from coming back for more pastries, but next time I may bring my own coffee. I came in yesterday morning for the first time and was impressed with not only the selection, but the freshness and flavor of my pastry!There is plenty of seating, the staff are very friendly, and it's a cute and clean space. The layout of everything is intuitive, making it easy to spot your sugar-glazed victim before you get up to the register (and I am all about avoiding the fumbling have-to-make-a-decision-now-because-you're-&#173;staring-at-me-and-I-don't-even-know-what-you-have-&#173;yet encounters).I got a peach danish and it was delicious! Fresh fruit, lots of butter, flaky just as they should be.My only complaint (and it's not the establishment's fault, but a review has to be a total overview) is that I don't think pastries should be as expensive as local bakeries/shops have them priced. Regardless, I am sure I will be back.As a side - I would definitely recommend this as a nice place to take a date or a visiting relative. Can I please tell you how much I adore this place. I loves it! the staff is so nice the coffee is so yummy and the pastries mmm...The carmalized onion and swiss croissant is my favorite. The location is fantastic right on Ballard Ave near tons of shops. I love the space the benchs by the windows and its perfect to just enjoy your coffee and read. The music they play is always so great, not crazy loud and irritating. The space is really bright and inviting. I just loved this place so much. Its right around the corner from my work so I go their frequently. a mix of japanese with pastries - i love it! i wasn't expecting to get anything and saw a brioche filled with cream and azuki beans. i had to ask the woman at the bakery if i read correctly. i love azuki beans and have never seen them this way. so she warmed it up for me and it went perfectly with my coffee.they also had other Japanese inspired pastries. my friend got a green tea muffin where you could taste the green tea matcha. really interesting and those wanting to taste the fusion of Japanese flavors, try it out! Bumping up a star, cause the staff is so nice and their Americanos really are fabulous. One of my Minneapolis Yelp friends suggested we stop here during my trip. &#160;We were so excited when we realized how close it was to my friend's place! &#160;We stopped in for a sandwich and a treat to take to the gardens by the locks with us. &#160;We got the yam, mushroom, artichoke sandwich on multigrain. &#160;The veggies were really fresh. &#160;Our mistake for not adding cheese and having it grilled. &#160;That would have made it even better -- and held it all together more. &#160;We got the basque cake, which had good flavor but was a little dry. &#160;The Ethiopian blend coffee more than made up for it though! &#160;Ethiopian is by far my favorite, so I drink it often. &#160;This one was quite possibly in the top five I have ever had. &#160;It had the nice, earthy, slightly berry flavor to it, but it also had a hint of apricot. &#160;Delicious! I have been in twice now, both times I have had some sort of croissant and a latte. &#160;Both times I have been helped by the same curly-haired guy. &#160;He has been very welcoming and pleasant, the baked goods have been very good, they're not too spendy (For what I got) and I've gotta say, I really like the open layout where you can see straight back to where they bake the stuff they sell there. &#160;I plan on coming back sometime in the near future.
I dig the flavorful combinations you can make with their diverse selection of toppings, sauces, cheeses, etc. My favorite so far is the buffalo chicken pizza, and this is one of the few places in Seattle that I've been able to find a taco pizza. I've only ordered the family-size pizza, which is about as big as our stove top and has huge floppy slices. It's one of my top indie pizza joints in the north end, but I don't order from here very often because the prices are pretty high if you don't have a coupon. Still, you get what you pay for: delicious, high-quality pie.Update: I finally ordered their deep dish pizza, and probably won't again--the bottom crust was an inch and a half thick! It was like eating a pizza sandwich, ok but not what I was expecting. The upside of the deep dish is that you get full off of one slice, though.Another example of how sweet this place is: aside from the free cookies that come with each order, they upgraded me to a large pizza for free because they didn't have any medium-sized pans available.And if you're complaining that a local indie pizza joint charges for online ordering, you're being silly--most non-chain pizza joints in Seattle either don't have a website or only list their menu. Just call in if you don't want to pay the fee! Or you can always opt for http://Pizzahut.com.
The one on Third Ave (for which there is no Yelp listing) is EXCELLENT!So yummy! So fresh! Such variety!I want this in Phoenix. i am one of those people that prefers a variety of flavors for every meal rather than just one...meaning i like my lunch to have a nice balance in color, a little red, a little green.... so when it comes to deciding what it is i want for lunch i usually come here...since i'm so indecisive and that way i can get EVERYTHING i want here. let's see....today for lunch for a mere 7 dollars i got a pinch of chow mien, a pinch of green beans with sesame oil, one piece of seaweed and spice tofu, one California roll, an avocado and tomato salad, a cucumber and bell pepper salad and a pot sticker. Although it sounds like a lot of food the secret is getting just a SMIDGE of everything. :) this place is always fresh and clean. the ladies that work here are really nice and fast. what more could you ask for!?
To clarify: this is a solid five stars for what we call "The Mystery Bar"-- the unnamed bar attached to Golden City. The food next door? Never had it, and don't care to try it. Now, for the Mystery...Cue music: "I see a red door and I want to paint it black..."I'm writing this review in the morning, which is appropriate because our friends Dan M. and Melissa F. originally discovered this hidden Ballard gem on an early Sunday morning walk, back in 2003. Did I say "gem"? Perhaps "cubic zirconium" would be closer to the truth. The Mystery Bar is a red door with no sign except for some blinking "Tsingtao" fluorescent above the door. You can't miss it. It's right next to Crack Alley. Dan and Melissa couldn't miss it that first morning. As the legend goes, at 8am that sunny Sunday morning, a woman comes running out of the bar, onto the sidewalk, screaming, "I f*#$ing love this bar!!!" and promptly ran back in. Apparently, they used to have happy hour starting at 6am for the graveyard shift crowd. Come on! Who wouldn't check this out after that glowing review?You walk in and are greeted by a disturbing mix of your standard Chinese-felt-stained-glass wall panels and two murals depicting what looks to be a riverside community in 1800's Louisiana. All I'm going to say is that my Grandpa told me that in the 1940's, this bar was called "The Plantation". Nevermind that. Continue on to the well-stocked jukebox, grab a sticky stool at the bar, or run straight to the bathrooms in the back. I've never been able to figure out why the bathrooms are named the way they are. Figure it out for yourself!Mystery Bar drink of choice? Why, Rainier in a can, of course! There used to be a bartender who'd make a mean kamakazi. And I do mean "mean". I recommend making friends with the locals (if any of them still frequent here), because our best Mystery nights have featured Robert the fisherman, Gwen the stripper, Selena the cross-dresser, and various other new friends. One of my favorite nicknames was born here. Some of my favorite nights with my favorite friends began/ended here. So why am I spoiling the mystery and writing about it now? Because it's already been discovered a bit. There are new owners behind the bar, new hipsters at the jukebox, new patrons in Crack Alley. Still, if you go on the right night, with the right vibe, and bring an attitude of laissez-faire, you just might fall under the spell as well. I feel like I should be leaving two reviews for Golden City. One that talks about how quick the delivery is, how slightly better than mediocre the food is, and how reasonably priced said delivery costs. And another totally different review about the bar.Let it be known. The bar and the restaurant are is as different as night and day, and are decent for their respective offerings. Let's talk about the bar for a second. The first thing you need to know, is that everytime I've been to the bar, a deaf-mute man has come in, sat next to me, put his head under the table, looked at my crotch and smiled. The first time it was unsettling, the second time it was amusing, and now it's expected. If I go to Golden City, I expect my crotch to be fully inspected. All in all, drinks are strong, food is tasty, and it's cheap. Not a bad deal.
This joint became a regular stop for us when walking downtown from Capitol Hill, even when we weren't very hungry. &#160; It became a sort of sickness, coming up with excuses to walk nearby, to leave to see a movie at Loews far too early, to accidentally sort of not realize which direction we were walking... Look! &#160;The crepe stand! &#160;Well if that's not serendipity, I don't know what is...It's no exaggeration to say that there are days - most days - when a crepe is the perfect food. &#160;Warm, hand-held, made quickly, savory or sweet, light or heavy. &#160;If there is a large convention at the center, entertain yourself by watching the stunned masses stand in line at the Subway Sandwich shop next door, while you enjoy a genuinely charming meal at the same price. &#160;Favorite crepe: salmon, and politely request them to replace the creme fresh with goat cheese.Only downer: I've twice gotten ice cream from them, and both times found the ice cream to be merely benign. &#160;The chai ice cream tasted so faintly as to almost taste like straight vanilla -- okay, but not what I wanted. &#160;I can't even remember what the other flavor I got was, it was so forgettable.So, in summary: eat crepes. &#160;Go with at least another person so one of you can get a savory and the other a sweet, and then switch back and forth between bites. If you ever think about going to the Cheesecake Factory, go here instead.The people are nice. &#160;I wanted a lox and spinach crepe, hold the creme fraiche. &#160;They went out of their way to offer other things to substitute for it. &#160;I took them up on the roasted red bell peppers. I'm still eating it now, it's really good.I saw the prominently displayed Yelp sticker and mentioned I found the place on Yelp. &#160;I said that I'd give them a review later, and my crepier laughed and said I was making her nervous. &#160;Nothing to worry about!Fast, good, well-priced, and a couple blocks from work. &#160;I'll be back. &#160;I got my crepe to go and didn't go inside, so I can't comment on the seating area. I just moved from Seattle to DC. La Creperie Voila is one of my favorite haunts in Seattle and I am going to miss it terribly!! Am looking for a replacement in the nation's capitol. Wish me luck. I found this place on yelp, and let me just say the crepes here kick some righteous ass! The only problem is the parking. They're affordable, and reasonably fast which is why I have a problem with paying for an hour of parking just to go there. A+ on the crepes F- for locale. La Creperie Voila is a &#160;rare treat for me. &#160;The stand is directly in front of the convention center on Pike next to a Subway. &#160;You choose your crepe from a large menu that features a handful of different sweet and savory crepes. &#160;Their signature crepe is lemon, butter and sugar. &#160;It is tangy and sweet and makes for a great breakfast. &#160;If you want lunch you can choose between different meats, cheeses, and vegetables. &#160;They also offer other traditional simple French cuisine like ratatouille. &#160;The staff is amiable; my friend and I talked to the guy there during the entire process of our crepes being cooked and enjoyed every minute. &#160;They aren't the fastest place, and when a line forms you can wait for a long time as it takes about 2 minutes per crepe. &#160;I highly recommend La Creperie Voila, especially in the mid-morning when they are likely to have no other customers Especially on Mondays when Saley is closed and I still have to get a crepe, I sometimes go to this crepe shop.Someone has mentioned that their crepe is little dark and it is for me too...but it's ok. I still like it.I usually get the cured ham one. it's good :) cheese and spinach...this can not go wrong....I don't think it can really.Then I eat it in the Convention Center where it's warm and clean. I like this place because they listen to you. &#160;TH wanted a ganache crepe without a lot of sugar and they did it. Ditto for my citron crepe, light on butter and sugar.I have yet to try Saley, but honestly, after my bad supreme experience a few years ago, I haven't had a crepe experience in Seattle.I say, if you are the convention center, check it out. We stumbled upon this place in search of a quick bite to eat on our way to the Triple Door...after reading about how Wild Ginger got written up for unsanitary practices and the fact that their prices are ridiculous, we wanted to find something on the way.I heart this place. &#160;Juliana is the cutest thing ever and makes fabulous mouthwatering tasty crepes.I wish it were closer to my office so I could go there on a regular basis, but alas, I must make a special trip in order to enjoy the yummy yummy crepes Juliana has to offer.
I'm a simple girl when it comes to my cocktails, give me vodka and tonic, soda, cranberry, diet coke and I'm happy. &#160;While at Zig Zag I decided to be adventurous and go out on a limb and try one of the drinks made by their world famous mixologist. &#160;I noticed one drink with vodka on their house special list, the drink with no name or something like that and I went with that. &#160;Bad bad decision it kind of tasted like what I'd picture a flavored rubbing alcohol tasting like and to think it was made with Grey Goose, how anything made with Grey Goose could be bad I had no idea. &#160;I'm sure if you are a fan of bourbon or gin or things I've never heard of you'd probably like the drinks. &#160;The company I was with was great and the booths were nice if I ever go back though I'm sitting at the bar and having them make me a special Mitzie drink with vodka and things I know I like. Oh the conflict, oh the unmet expectation, oh the ensuing writers block. Round 1: As soon as I walked into this place I knew I was going to love it, everyone said I would love it, and right off the bat I loved the atmosphere and started making plans for how this was to be my new favorite bar. I would make friends with the renowned bartender, he'd come to learn my tastes, we'd make up fun drinks together...but it was busy, and I was with a big group, so I figured I would come back later for that bit of wishful thinking. The waitress gave us the menu to peruse, and at first I didn't understand that she just left without answering any questions, because I was too busy oohing and aahing over fancy drink concoctions. When she came back I was confused as to her put-out attitude but figured since we were with a large group perhaps that was just unnerving. Long story short I didn't like my drinks, or anyone elses, and I didn't know what we had done (we weren't a boisterous group, it's not like I was out with Yelpers this time) to earn the scorn of our waitress. Round 2:Yelper happy hour! Alright! An excuse to give this place a second chance! Their normal $8+ drinks are a practically half price. Expectations readjusted and ready to love it! Oh no! Our waitress doesn't like us again. The drinks are all kind of gross again*. &#160;The waitress auto-added the gratuity again. I am disappointed again. Round 3:Has yet to happen, but I'm hoping to go there solo (cause I'm trying to drink more by myself these days) sit at the bar like a proper customer and see if I can't make my expectations of this bar become a reality. *I enjoy a stiff cocktail, I don't shy away from bitters, not everything has to be fruity, I get it, c'mon Zig Zag we should be buddies! One of my two favorite bars in the city and having been to most of them that's saying something...this is a bar bar...I'm sure they have food, I've seen menu's and I've seen people eating but I really can't comment on the food since all I've ever done here is drink...and why not? &#160;it's perfect for just that...The bartenders are great...Ben, Casey and especially Murray...the cocktailers are hot and have attitudes...half the people in there have a serious load on...it's dark and crowded...what's not to love?? &#160;I read some of the other reviews and wonder to myself what are these amateurs doing ordering drinks at this place...stick to Linda's people...ZZ is not for the timid drinker...Their inventory is amazing...Scotch, Tequila, Bourbon, aperitif, you name it and they probably have it or can recommend something comprable or better...or take a chance, tell the bartender what you like and he'll do his best to try and make you happy...When I walk in and over half of the people in there are in the business (restaurant) I know they're doing something right... This is where we meet up the infamous Seattle Yelpers! &#160;OMG! &#160; As Michael would put it "slightly swanky" bar for happy hour starters. &#160; &#160;LOL! &#160;But i'll just break it down Maia style:House cocktails &#160;= Needs more structure. &#160;I had no idea what I ordered because the drinks were strong. &#160;After the first three, I started to feel good. &#160; But after Charlie "jedi mind trick" Omar and I ... we were gone!Bruschetta = &#160;Made simple. &#160;Nothing spectacular to remember... but yes.. it was burnt on the bottom portion.Calamari = &#160;I missed it.Ambiance = Great meeting spot for us! &#160;Not hard to find form the waterfront... kinda spacious for a group of 20 to meet... &#160;very dark inside the restaurant. Wine = I skipped it. Service = One star. &#160;I couldn't hear our waitress's accent very well. If you're going to visit alone, just head to the bar and enjoy the mojitos.If you're going to meet friends and yelpers, get the lounge seating areas. &#160; This is worth another visit. &#160; &#160;Thanks to Chuck we didn't stay very long! &#160; &#160; Okay man.. you got me with ALLLL THE HAPPY HOUR DRINKS! How did I manage to live here this long and not experience Murray's bartending until now? I don't drink cocktails that much. I told him my usual drink and asked him to come up with something I'd like. He hit it out of the ball park!I ate off the late night menu. Good and ample nibbles for late night noshing. What else could you ask for? Oh, an environment in which you can have a conversation and where folks are very friendly? Yeah, that's theZig and the Zag of it. Just stopped in there after the Edgewater on a Wednesday evening to see if my SO's former employee was working but he wasn't there.We first sat outside, very italian feeling- but it took 10 minutes for the waitress to bring us water then she just walked away. After 15 more minutes of waiting, we decided to go to the bar. Noticed she was sitting on the back side of the bar reading a paper. The other reason we stopped in was to see one of the top ten bartenders in the US in action. My SO was amazed at how fast and smooth he was at making the drinks. He wanted to see how he would make a mojito and he was blown away at the bartender's technigque as well as the taste. After our round we saw him making a French 75- it's basically gin and champagne with lemon and sugar. But he put it in a champagne glass. It was deadly but good.We noticed that it's a hotspot for an after-work getaway but still wasn't too crowded. As far as bar service, I highly recommend- sitting anywhere else you may get poor service. I had wonderful drinks at Zig Zag -- I went with a friend, we sat at the bar and described kind of drinks we like to the bartender, and he mixed one up for each of us. &#160;Actually he followed that with a couple more, on the house. &#160;If we didn't like one, he would take it back and start over. I'm not sure how much of this had to do with my friend's flirting ability, but I would definitely not write this place off as 'bad drinks.' This is not the place to go with a big group. &#160;Go with just one other person, when it's not too busy, sit up at the bar, and actually talk to the bartender. I have never had as good a Vodka Gimlet as I've had, on more than one occasion, at Zig Zag. &#160;They are consistently delicious, which makes me smile. &#160;I did try one of the house cocktails, and it was less than desirable for me. &#160;The taste was black licorice - not my preference. &#160;The waitress did ask how the drink was (she had suggested it) with the implied tone that she would replace it with another drink if I didn't like it, but I declined. &#160;I was feeling wimpy that night.Every appetizer I've had here was yummy, but I've never tried eating a full meal, so I can't vouch for that. &#160;The chocolate mouse was yummy too. Murray is quite simply the fastest bartender, able to sustain high quality service, I have ever seen in my entire life. Ever.He had a bar brimming with people as I walked in, so I foolishly assumed that my wine order would take a moment. I turned to talk to some friends and Murry was standing right next to me within seconds! ! ! Spry is not the word. Startled at his Puma like reflexes, I watched in awe as he poured me a tasting! The bar was packed, and he's not just slamming the glass in front of me? He's actually leaving the bar and making sure I enjoy my wine! &#160;He's actually sitting here patiently waiting to see if I approve! Unreal! He turned to an arguing young couple, said some witty comment about never minding the little things, and they smiled. As I blinked in astonishment of this remarkable &#160;fellow... HE WAS GONE! A quick glance around the room and there he was at the bar! Smiling away as he expertly crafted a perfectly executed martini! Smoothly conversing, smiling, concentrating, repeat. I was in the presence of greatness.As I was leaving I couldn't resist the urge to tell Murray how amazing I thought he was, and he looked at me quizzically, as if to say, "did I do something special?"I couldn't decide how much to tip him, so I just gave him my wallet. A day later and I'm writing this review... It is now my very strong belief that Murry is supernatural. Probably a vampire, but I'm not ruling out cybernetic construct from the future. Apparently world renown bartender, well crafted chic Italian food, a well arranged (if small) dining room, and a killer "hole in the wall" sort of spot on the stairs up to the market.Stop in for an elixir, but skip the usual - take a chance.Update: Take a chance I did, I tried 3 of the more adventurous drinks on the menu last night only to determine that they are apparently well beyond my understanding of mixology. The drinks were well balanced, and decidely on target for the intended taste (in my estimation), but unfortunately I just didn't like it.From this limited sampling, their star bartender is an excellent chemist. Perhaps a well crafted classic would be a better order. I am in love with the sauteed calamari at Zig Zag. &#160;I shared one order with Maia, but liked it so much I ordered another one all for me. &#160;It's not battered and deep-fried (yawn), &#160;which is a nice change of pace. &#160;The squid is sauteed with tomatoes, capers, and garlic. &#160;And I think anchovy paste, which gave the dish a deep, pungent quality. &#160;Their bruschetta was really good, but they burned the bread. &#160;The pizza was pretty good too, but nothing special really.The house cocktail menu was WEAK. &#160;Only one vodka drink? &#160;WTF. &#160;The rest of the cocktails consisted of bizarre combinations that just didn't belong together. &#160;Most of them were not good. &#160;My drink, Satan's Soulpatch, or some such, was OK once I got used to it. &#160;But I only ordered it for lack of better options.Overall, great food, bad cocktails, and good service. Y'all are crazy.Here's your recipe for having one of the best nights at a bar ever, courtesy of the fine people at Zig Zag:1) Sit at the bar. Really. If the bar is full, wait or come back later and wait for a stool. A big part of being at this one-of-a-kind bar is watching the dance the bartenders do.2) Go early, or late, or on a slow night. The staff and patrons are almost all great and interesting people. It's nice if you get a chance to make new friends, and this is a great place to do so.3) Don't go with a big group. See 1 &amp; 2.4) Expand your horizons. This isn't a bar to go to if you want to drink Gin and Tonics all night. Talk to Ben or Kacy or Murray and describe the type of drinks you typically enjoy, and they are sure to make you something you've never had before that you will most likely love.DIsclaimer: True, I haven't written many reviews for Yelp (though I've been lurking here the better part of two years), but that has to do with not having the inspiration to write reviews where I am merely adding to the general opinion of a business. In general I find Yelpers to have intelligent things to say and I more often than not agree with the overall consensus.I am, however, a staunch supporter of businesses I believe in and will rally to their side if I feel the need to. I currently live in San Francisco and miss the Zig Zag very much- you are living in a place with this resource at hand. &#160;You may not live there forever. Take advantage of it while you still can. Ok I have to admit that I didn't have the world's worst experience there at Zig Zag. The first drink I had there was the Satan's Soul Patch which was pretty good and nearly as horrible as everyone else drinks. Then I was recommended to try the ABC(tasted like a Manhattan) and was pleasantly surprised. And my house pie(margarita pizza) that I split with my table was pretty darn good too, so all in all I was very happy with my choices. I guess I can thank lady luck for my decent time at Zig Zag's. I didn't actually eat here, but met a friend for a drink. I liked the atmosphere. Not too crowded. The wait staff was mediocre. They also ran out of mint for the mojitos.... lovely drinks. just lovely. fresh-squeezed juice and proper liquor. it's a bit too far for me to frequent, but thankfully i have a worthy rival just around the corner.
Some places are just comfortable. I've been stopping by Arbor Deli since 2007, and it hasn't changed. There is nothing fancy here, it's all about effeciency. You can grab an assortment of different drinks from cooler, and order a number of items from the menu. In the morning I grab an egg and cheese croissant which fills me up nicely (oppossed to some lighter/fancier fare you find). In the afternoon you can grab a few differnt items, including a good chicken terriyaki at a good price. Also, can't believe this is the first place I had Sriracha sauce!The owners are very friendly and will remember your face. Good place to grab a quick bite on a busy day.
Please note that this review only stems from visiting on weekend nights for drinks and not for a food purchase or for Happy Hour.Pros: Great Service, Friendly Staff, Fun live Bands, Strong DrinksCons: Needs more fans for ventilation (Hot on warmer days) and at times the music is a touch too loud (Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of loud music but when my ears hurt and I have to shout all night it might be a touch too loud)Go here for fun, dancing, and to enjoy drinks with friends. &#160;It is your typical pub atmosphere but was overall an excellent place to kick back and have a few brews. &#160;We had a lot of fun and I hope to eventually try out the Happy Hour as well as I have heard good things. What's not to love about this place! I am not a big fan of coming into downtown, but when I do, this place is it! Love how it's off the alley, not the main street. I love Guinness, so that should tell you something too! Love the live bands they have, even when they aren't the best, it's still a great time. Getting a table can be a challenge sometimes, but hey, its busy! We got lucky Sat night, walked in and just then the front table opened up- had to race for it though, kinda like Steve Martin and Kevin Bacon going for the cab in Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles.....but we won! &#160;sweet! The service has always been good - you just have to be a wee bit patient when it's slammed. Drink up!! Ask what they have before you order. That's my number one piece of advice. The waitress was very nice, but when I asked for the apple tart? "Sorry, we're out." Which of the two ciders is best? "Well, we only have one of them right now." A friend asked for something else off the menu - didn't have it. &#160;I ended up getting the one cider that was available and the baked brie and fruit plate. The fruit slices were ridiculously thin, but the brie was delicious. The cider (don't remember the name, but it started with an 'M') was also good. I might give them one more try, but I wasn't blown away with my first visit. The best part about this bar is that it has 2 sides. The side you walk in is narrow and then opens up into a room full of tables where you will be greeted to tunes from the mother land. Albeit the side can get pretty hot and tables fill up fast, it's nice if you want to relax, drink some good spirits, and listen to unique live music. The other side is a more low key area with some tables by the door and tables that surround the exterior of the place. They play top 40 hits style music and it's a lot cooler (heat wise) and a little bit more low key. Overall, a definite stopping point for me whenever I am in Seattle or Portland. Met up with friends and my girlfriend for a meal and a night of live music. I am always up for an Irish pub that pours a good pint. Kells does that, I'm just not to keen on the food. I ordered the Pork Tenderloine, with apple chutney, fresh vegetables and I got mashed potatoes and gravy. It wasn't bad at all but the chop came butterflied to make it appear larger than it actually was. Everything had good flavor but what I was served was not worth $21. My other dislike is the seating area for food is in one side with more bar seating. When there are large groups coming in that all they do is drink it makes having a nice meal almost intolerable. So if you want to have a nice meal come early before the bar really starts going. As for the music, it was great, the other side of Kells has two bars with table service as well. Check and see what playing before hand, we were able to see a great trio playing all sorts or Irish tunes! This was one of the friendliest restaurants I visited while in Seattle. I visited twice - the first time for lunch, as my husband saw sausage rolls on the menu and wanted a taste of home. I don't usually care for pork, but I had a bite of that and it was really good. I ordered the vegetable pasty and the clam chowder and both were solid. For me, a clam chowder is ruined by having rubbery clams or too much pepper, and this one was just right. The soda bread was really nice, too. The waiter was really pleasant, and was happy to chat to us for a minute and make some suggestions for things to see in town that aren't in the guide books. We weren't treated like annoying tourists or like unwelcome riffraff, which was a big part of why we ended up going back there for dinner our last night in town. After a week of heavy (but delicious, mostly) food and mixed service, a simple bowl of soup in a friendly atmosphere was just what we needed. This place is, as the young'uns these days would say, "poppin'" on St. Patrick's Day. I don't know what it's like on a regular basis, but this is definitely the place to be I'm guessing on major holidays in which drinking is a big part of the celebration. It's surrounded by great Seattle attractions, and various other restaurants. The drinks are kind of expensive, but they would be at any other nice bar or pub you go to. Whenever I go to Kells I have mixed emotions. I love the bands that they have playing on the weekends. I like the location on the edge of the Pike Place Market. I even don't mind the crowd; it's entertaining to watch drunken frat boys trying to dance a jig. But what I don't care for are the overpriced drinks and rude bouncers; stop calling your friend on your walkie talkie and pointing out this person's hair or how that person is dressed. A note to the bartender - don't serve drinks that your bouncers are going to snatch away a minute later. Try to follow your own last call, ok?? This is our regular visit when we are in Seattle.Its a rustic, woody irish bar, and although I haven't been here in the evening for some strange reason, its charm is quite nice during the day.. The wait staff is very helpful and kind and service is quick.I had the sheppards pie which was tasty, and Im always a fan of the corned beef and cabbage.. Definely a great place to visit when you are in the wharf area if you are up for a pub crawl and its fare... Fine cuisine it is not, and if thats what your looking for, this isn't the place. But if you want good healthy food, cold beer and kind folks, this is a great place to start. Came here for a quick drink during a birthday bar crawl. Difficult to find location, dive bar type decor, very loud ambiance, rude bartenders. A bit pricey, but has some amazing appetizers.We had the fresh oysters, chicken pasty, and Potato Farl Wrap. All that and several craft beers made for a nice little evening. Okay, well it may not have the most beautiful outdoor seating: a number of plastic chairs and tables in a back alley half a block from Pike Place. &#160;It's still a nice respite from the throngs of people making their way through the market on any given day. Great place to stop for a Guinness or three, friendly waitresses, and a nice vibe. A friend and I stopped in for a quick beer before dinner at The Pink Door, because we had seen their ad in the Sounders FC program and we like to support those who support our boys. &#160;We were very impressed with the ambiance, the prices, and the selection. &#160;There was definitely a pub feel, lots of dark woods, but the space is very open and encourages friendly conversation. &#160;Happy hour happens daily 4-7 and any draft (other than Hoegaarden, sad) is $4.50. &#160;Our server was great. &#160;We plan to return on a night on which they're playing live music and have dinner. &#160;The decor and menu looked authentic to Ireland. &#160;I am looking forward to trying a potato farl. Went here with some coworkers several times while I was in town for work, and also once alone when I couldn't find a seat next door at the White Horse Tavern (which is far and away one of my favorite bars nation wide).The food was ok (standard pub grub). The atmosphere was a bit lacking, and there are better places around. It has sort of a "club" feel on Friday and Saturday night with the live music and starts to get packed, mostly lacking an Irish pub feel. Irish pub a block away from Pike Place Market. Nice patio allows watching the world go by. We got small plates and drinks. Staff was friendly and attentive. Good choice of irish brews as well as local craft beer on tap. A delightful place to while away a sunny Seattle afternoon. Stopped in for a quick drink after dinner across the alley at the Pink Door. The bar itself was nothing special but the live entertainment, I could have stayed all night. Just a single middle-aged dude with an acoustic guitar playing great songs. After a full day of walking everywhere, we stopped here to end our night. It's a small bar. I didn't have anything to drink, but I wanted dessert. I ended up getting the cheesecake and it made my night.I did feel awkward, because we were a party of 8 asian people in a place that seemed like asian people shouldn't be in. But the service was really good for a Friday night. We also ended up getting oysters and they melt in your mouth. I would go here again for the oysters.Don't expect to come here and hang out with your regular, feel good type music. It was very different and I can't explain it. But there was a banjo and a fiddle. I have nothing against it, but I just want to warn you ahead of time.Oh yah, supposedly the place is haunted too. It used to be a mortuary before it became a bar waaaayyy back in the day. But I didn't have any unusual experiences that night. Awesome happy hour, $3 items and $3.50 wells. Nice view in a super cute locale. Came in for a quick drink. The bartender knows how to pour a Guinness. That's all I wanted, and it was done with supreme technicality. my friend has been talking about this place for a while. and being from seattle i wanted to check it out but like most locals i put it off for a while. (mostly because im busy and when im not my friends are busy) well i went there about a month ago and loved it. i felt right at home. the staff was nice the food was to my liking and they had a good choice of booze. i think what made me like it more was the history of the place. it is a old building and just being a few blocks away from where i work i would def come back another time. as for the rumors of ghosts i never saw any lol. overall i had a good time and would love to come back with friends. ive only been there 1 time so far so i cant tell you what the best thing on the menu is. but atleast take a chance. if you dont like it you will at least like the area. Great place! Always good service and good food. Definitely a fave. If you like beer and ale, this is your place. The wine list is okay, but nothing to write home about.The food is hearty, but hardly superlative. The menu tends toward American versions of Irish standards. You won't find lamb in your shepherd's pie, for instance.On a Friday night, the bar can get quite busy, and the people watching is decent. We stopped by here because the weather turned bad and we decided a drink would help us cope. &#160;It's pretty dark inside, but there are televisions, and plenty of tables and chairs. &#160;The bar is pretty solid too. &#160;We got some beers and the bartender made me a drink. &#160;Prices are reasonable. &#160;We may have ordered food, but we weren't given menus, so it never came up. &#160;If you're in the area looking to watch a game and get a drink, this could be your place. Best chowder in Pike Place Market. Avoid crazy weekend crowds and stop in for lunch on a weekday. My sons loved the soda bread. Bonus: Mimosas offered on Mondays! Stopped into this place for a drink. Love the atmosphere! I went during the week so it was pretty empty but staff was very attentive and nice. Gave great suggestions on drinks. I will definitely be coming back again! While on vacation we stopped in for some cocktails. The bartender Rory was awesome and made our visit more than memorable. We laughed, had so much fun, felt special and were very well taken care of. Kells is a decent bar. The fish and chips came recommended and the drinks were enjoyable. Depending on the time of day or what night you visit, Kells can be packed. Sometimes, it is difficult to find a place to sit or even stand. I really enjoyed Kells on a recent business trip to Seattle. &#160;The pasties and sausage roll were the perfect snacks after a Guinness and IPA. &#160;I heard it was an old funeral parlor at one time, which added to the ambiance. &#160; I suspect I'll be returning on future Seattle trips, especially since it is centrally located near the sites and conveniently right near the Marriott on the water. This is my favorite place in Seattle, bar none. If I could manage it I would go here a couple times a week. I love the food and the ambience and everything about the place. The wait staff is always super friendly and helpful. I especially love that there is live music every night. The one and only thing that could make this place better would be a comfy leather armchair reserved just for me. Friendly bartender. Reasonable selection. Nice customers. :) We went here after the baseball game. When we walked in, we noticed how dark the place was (even for a pub). The server was nice but she was handling a lot of tables and it was hard to get her attention when we needed to order &#160;and for the check. In terms of liquor, their draft beer selection was limited. We ordered: irish cheese platter- the 4 cheeses were good but the serving was so small corned beef pasty- pretty goodnot our fave irish pub and probably wont go back to this place. Good music, really sweet bartender, but terrible food. &#160;And the house wine is dreck (yes, I could have presumed this before entering, but still). &#160;The mussels were really bad, even by pub standards... Delicious food and a good environment, table service is kind of slow but its well worth it for the food. I love coming here after a Sounders game, guaranteed to be a good time! Best sausage rolls on earthCorn beef and cabbage always a good bet We enjoyed taking a &#160;break here one afternoon. Though they were full-ish, the waitress happily found us a table. A few drinks were enjoyed and we moved on. Would certainly go back. The waitress was great but my god the food was disgusting and the drinks sucked. Went 2 nights in a row while visiting Seattle. &#160;Great atmosphere, friendly, fun staff, and good food!
This is a review strictly of the pre-late night action, before the place goes crazy. &#160;Let me tell you a story.Here's the low down, daddy-o/mommy-o (or should I be PC and just go with the less offensive person-o?). &#160;Went there with three friends and ordered up some burgers and sandwiches. &#160;Their Ruben is pretty great, as is their Philly. &#160;We all put our orders in and got two pitchers (they're the lame plastic ones that can only fill four glasses 1.5 times if you're lucky). &#160;Two of them get their food fifteen or so minutes later, we wait...and wait...and wait. &#160;We had the great pleasure of getting to watch them eat while we were hungry. &#160;Yay!*The guy running everything brings us another pitcher "on him" he says because he knows we're getting anxious and a little (okay, a lot) annoyed. &#160;Okay, I'll give you respect for that. &#160;Finally, the food comes for the rest of us. &#160;We ate, it's really good. &#160;Their fries were bomb.The bill comes and they took all three pitchers of beer off of our tab because of the inconvenience. &#160;That was totally radtastical! &#160;Luckily, we didn't have unbreakable plans to be anywhere. &#160;Therefore, I am a fan, Dantes.*Indicates more sarcasm than can possibly be expressed in human words. There was a stench like someone had pierced a sewer line. This was up in the top "paradise" level. I'm thankful I'm agnostic; if that's paradise, I think I'll start examining buddhism a bit more.This place seems like it could be a lot of fun if you like bar games, though. Air hockey, pool tables, foosball and some arcade games are scattered around between the bottom and top levels. The mid area has a dining area and the only bar in the place, located right at the front door. For Dante's size, I'm surprised at the alcohol bottle neck. The bar is small and gets crowded, and if this place gets filled to capacity, I imagine it takes a while to get drinks. Considering it's a college hang out, I imagine there needs to be a lot of liquid courage dispensed before folks start to let loose.Door man was awesome, though. I hung out and chatted with him for a bit.The juke box is well hidden to the right of the front door in a small room, for you JB heroes.I just couldn't take the smell. Ugh. Hope that was a one time thing... Dante's sucks. The food is bad (their idea of bean dip is basically a heated up can of refried), the mixed drinks are undrinkable, and they are trying SO GODDAMN hard to be a dance club these days. It's awful. Whatever small amount of affection I might've had for them while sitting in the front having a pint is instantly gone at 10 p.m. when the world's shittiest dj comes on. Think incredibly loud dance remixes of late 90s hip hop. That's right, dance remixes of Master P and the like. I actually kind of can't believe people come here. It has nothing to offer that a dozen places don't do better. The first time I went here, I was absolutely stunned that someone had misplaced a dance floor in the middle of a dingy college bar. I just don't get it. For it's size (3 levels, lots of tables), there's only one bar and the area around it is tiny. Consequently, if it's even moderately crowded, it takes FOREVER to walk up and get a drink. On top of that, the one time I ordered a Guinness, the petite Asian bartender poured it completely wrong (all at once, and not in a Guinness glass). If you like copious amounts of inexpensive beer (cheap PBR pitchers on Thursday) and/or dancing to shitty club music, then check it out, I guess. Dante's is activities-oriented with an eye toward beer pong, darts, billiards, dancing, arcade machines etc.Though I won't turn down a game of cut-throat if there's a table free, it's &#160;a harried rush to the tables and the dance floor is fairly neglected. As a result, I spend most of my time at Dante's waiting my turn for something--whether it's a pitcher or a pool shot.Come here if you wish to wile away the evening with games rather than &#160;company, but I prefer a place to really unwind. Every time I go here I keep thinking oh maybe this time it will be better then the last. But it never gets better. Consistently I have to ask for drinks more then once, even when I have been at the bar and asked them. I guess by the time they've made the first drink they have forgotten the second one I asked for. The food is allright, but it was what I wasn't expecting anything amazing. Their guacamole is really good, I will give them that. I also feel like the girls that work there are rarely even smile, or are nice to their customers. Do they want a tip or not? I do like that they have many pool tables, but you have to get there early if you want a table. Lots of seating too, up and downstairs... oh, and they have a jukebox, so your stuck listening to the crap that other people want to listen to, or shelling out money to wait forever to listen to the songs you want to hear. I tried to like Dante's, I really did. After all, so many of my friends liked it, and they all encouraged me to join them. So, finally, I did. I was less than impressed.The food is mediocre; the Irish Emigrant has better pub food, as do Finn MacCool's and Pies and Pints. The pitchers are cheap, I'll grant that, but you can find cheap pitchers a number of places. The deal breaker for me was the terrible, horrible mixed drinks. I mean, yecch. I love Long Island Iced Teas, and I'm not hard to please with them. However, I was served an absolutely miserable Long Island Iced Tea. I forced some upon my friends, and they agreed with me, and it was soon dubbed the Hoboken Iced Tea. Another friend's Red Bull and Vodka was basically a can of Red Bull with a teaspoon of vodka; you couldn't smell it, and only barely taste it.For the money one could spend here, one could find a much better place in the U-District. The collusion of them adding a dance floor and Tommy's closing has made Dante's go downhill somewhat - and downhill for me means more Greeks per capita. Such is usually fueled by the combination said dance floor/DJ and cheap pitchers of PBR.That said, on any given night, the percentage of frat boys and sorority sisters is far lower here than at, say, the Irish Emigrant (I cry for that place), Finn MacCool's, or no-longer-best-kept-secret Die Bierstube. The multiple levels also cleverly lets multiple kinds of crowds keep to themselves, (although the often-terrible DJ music is WAY too loud on the upper level). Also, it's moderately-priced enough that one can safely skip the Happy Hour, thereby avoiding the questionable crowds.But here's why I go: Good(-enough) food (vegetarian friendly!), good location, friendly staff, and pretty much the only place I know of where I can get seasonal New Belgium beer on tap. I went to Dante's last night to enjoy some trivia and although it's made up of primarily college students, I really had a good time. It's a dive-bar for sure. Dimly lit, hasn't been redecorated in 30 years, etc but it was a good time had by all. If you're easily annoyed by the antics of recently turned 21 year olds .. maybe it's best to avoid this place on trivia night. Dante's has $3 Jell-O shots that come in giant syringes (good for photos..) and a killer dance floor. &#160;As far as I can tell, they only have one pool table, one dart board, and one foosball table. &#160;But I like Dante's. &#160;It took forever to get a drink, but the atmosphere was great. &#160;Roomy, with an upstairs section and DJ Lounge as well as the bar and dance floor. &#160;I'll be back. I live on the same block as Dante's and I've only been there once since I moved in. &#160;That says something. &#160;Granted I've lived in the U-District for 5 years and have had my fair share of Dante's experiences, I'm just not a fan. &#160;It's dark and dreary, attempts to be a dance scene (it's not) and it attracts weird groups. &#160;The only thing Dante's has going for it is Beer pong on Tuesday nights and cheap beer on Thursdays. Perhaps the only cool fact about this bar is that one of Washington's (indeed America's) most notorious serial killers, Ted Bundy used to go here to meet women. Perhaps they should name a drink after their most famous patron - like a two-ounce expresso chased with a shot of 151 - it'll pick you up and knock you out! Perhaps Dante's just sucks. I've yet to meet any interesting people (women or otherwise) here and the drinks are pathetically watered down. Head to the Monkey Pub, Blue Moon, Knarr, or University Inn if you seek a decent U-District bar. good trivia, pin ball, pool tables, and AIR HOCKEY! not to mention the very cool lodge type decor. plenty of square footage so you can avoid the crowds. &#160;very cool place, just be prepaired to stand in line for a drink. If your not in the mood for lines, theirs the monkey bar just across the street, also a cool little place.warning, avoid on kareoke night. Bad singers, bad setup for singing, bad music selection...... you have been warned. I used to come here often. But I wouldn't say that I ever really liked it. The clientele are questionable. The service is bad. Well I am sitting here trying to think how I feel about Dante's....hmmm it's fun? &#160;Well most times that I've been there have been pretty fun. &#160;Total dive bar, decent hot wings, also decent beer specials throughout the week. &#160;Thursdays cheap PBR, which is nice I guess. They have a dance floor that (like other reviewers have said) only gets full after midnight when everyone is drunk enough to dance. &#160;I really dig the whole devil theme, that's pretty cool. &#160;Other then that its pretty cool, oh the past couple times we have gone there have been a few creepy older guys dancing by themselves holding a 3/4 full glass of beer....very odd. But yeah, i will go back.
They're known as 'the best pork bbq in Seattle'. What a great atmosphere! In the front is the takeout area. Go straight through the walkway and you enter a beautifully decorated dining area. Here, the furniture is of redwood and looks just exquisite. Plenty of room, too.$5 lunches and $9 dinners...can't beat that. What I loved the most, though, was the HUGE pacu fish in the tank by the front window. You've got to see it. :)
Mia's chicken salad sandwich ($6.25) is delicious if you have them hold off on the mayo. &#160;Mmmm. &#160;A warning for those who don't like them, it has raisins. Also, their chai is pretty good too.It's a small place with good food and reasonable prices, but just not as fast as fast food. &#160;You can, however, call ahead to pickup your order.
Oh man I've wanted to eat here for some time &amp; had a craving for some BBQ - well my wife remembered this place and we had talked about it a few months ago.I had the combo... oh man decisions... pork ribs and pulled pork w/sweet potato cornbread and mac &amp; cheese.I also got to have a beer also! As a Texan, I'm quite spoiled when it comes to good BBQ. I drove by this place loads of times before stopping in for takeaway. It wasn't the best I'd ever had but it hit the craving I had for grilled meats with spicy sauce. Since I've dined there though, I'm torn. There was never any problem with the takeaway. My boyfriend liked their duck and BBQ chicken. I used the meat in salads once I arrived home. I liked their brisket and pulled pork - best kinds of meat to top a properly baked potato.When I went for lunch twice in one week, my friend and I noticed each time was a different customer service and food experience. One was really good: the food was hot and tasty served by friendly counter help. The other visit felt like they could care less for our business and the food was on the greasy room temperature side. Parking lot can fill up quickly. Both times that we dined in the restaurant, the tables were sticky. Overall I wasn't impressed with the dining area. I felt it could have been kept up better. I'd give them one more chance to see if they can reclaim that fourth star. I am also considering ordering one of their Thanksgiving turkeys but want to attend one of their tasting days before committing. I thought that was a nice thing to offer curious customers. Smokin Pete's is Ballards original BBQ joint long before the trend hit Ballard Avenue. Their meats are always perfect and I love that they Mexican coke by the liter-super cool. Whenever we are there we get 2 by 2 combo for $17 it's usually enough food left over for at least 2 more meals. As far Seattle goes they are one of the best; I may not be from the South but their brisket is always tender and never dry. I also only use the original BBQ sauce on the meat. It's perfect for Seahawk games as they do take out and their dining room is always clean as are there super cool haunted bathroom(you will have to try it yourself.) If you want BBQ, then thats what you're gonna get :) I love this place and have been coming for years for my togo orders. The beef brisket is amazeballs, so yummy ... I can go on and on about Pete's but its best you guys just go try it out for yourselves! Holy Smoky goodness! Simple, quick, and easy. &#160;I got a plate of brisket with two sides of collard greens. &#160;You do have to order at the counter and get your own utensils. &#160;BUT, the food is so good, the sauces so....saucy, that I was blown away. &#160;I wouldn't say this is the place to bring a date but if you and the guys need some solid food this is the place for you! Thank you Smokin' Petes for the great job done at my recent outdoor BBQ event! I worked with Julie Reinhardt, owner of Smokin' Pete's, for catering for a group of 30+ people at Golden Gardens. Both Julie and her BBQ were a huge hit. People were literally licking their plates - even vegetarians were satisfied with hush puppies, greens, potato salad and more. If you are looking for a fun, casual menu for a group event check out Smokin' Pete's. You can tell that Julie really cares to make it great! So far our favorite BBQ place in Ballard. The servings are more than adequate. We used to split the large rib entree and a piece of pie each but it was WAY too much, now we split the smaller rib plate, get one extra side and share a piece of pie. The brisket is a little dry for me but I LOVE the ribs with the crusty rub and good smoky flavor. Sadly the sauces don't really impress me and I didn't care for the greens but the Mac&amp;Cheese is good, cheesy and a bit greasy, exactly what the doctor ordered when you want homemade mac &amp; Cheese. The Hush Puppies are awesome and the pecan pie to die for. The service has always been wonderful but it can be a bit cold inside there sometimes temperature-wise. Not sure why. I have nothing against the folks running it, but truthfully it's hit or miss, and the smell outside is better than the final product. &#160;Been there 3 times, and I've had solid ribs, to fatty sandwiches, to flat out dry BBQ and that is never good. &#160;Their side are interesting and worth trying, but overall, places like Manna's in Greenwood, RoRo's just down the street, Pecos Pit and others are just more consistent, juicier, and just flat out better. &#160;Hope they can improve their consistency in the product, for now I just don't see myself trying them again. This place needs a reset - steam table style sides and corn bread served with plastic wrap around it. &#160;Not the cleanest looking floors and sticky tables. &#160;On the plus side, large portions and the BBQ itself is not that bac. &#160;Great they support local musicians by having music on Thursday nights, but just go drink beer. An acquaintance said they enjoyed it but I found it disappointing. This Kansas City girl must be spoiled. I've tasted BBQ all over this country and know each style has it's own flavor but I ended up throwing this out after two bites of each item in my order (I give everything at least two tastes before deciding). Collard greens (sour), Beans (blech!), Brisket (thick sliced and tough). Even the sauce was sad and so was I after spending $12 to toss it all in the garbage when I got home, then pillage the pantry for something to satisfy my growling and unhappy belly.On the positive side the staff was friendly.Sorry Pete's, I wish it weren't so! Seriously, the homemade pickes were incredible.The mac was good, the beans were good and the sandwich was really tasty, though I thought the spicy link overwhelmed the pulled pork. Next time I'll just do the pulled pork and liven it up with sauce.Honestly, though I enjoyed it, I think RoRo and Pig Iron are much better. Drive by daily, 1st time stopping. I'm not a big BBQ fan or blackened &#160;meats. But i was starving and thought id give it a try. I ordered the blackened chicken salad and my son ordered the small rib plate (recommened by the man behind the counter) w/ Mac &amp; chz with sweet cornbread.Service was prompt and courteous if you like ordering at the counter, getting your own water, utensils, then taking your dishes to the dishwasherOur food arrived and w/2 adults &amp; one child there was plenty for all! The salad was pleasant, blackened chicken was the best I've had. The ribs were wonderful a long with the Mac &amp; chz. Cornbread was FANTASTIC. All that said, when I think of BBQ I think over sauced messy meat that is drowned with nothing less than sweet slop. Apparently I've had a bad experience I'm not remembering because Petes gave me a new open mind about BBQ restaurants.They also had a nice selection of sauces placed at your table to add if your that sauce person:) Just used them recently for catering a party of 35 people at our house. &#160;FOOD: Fantastic. &#160;A lot of compliments on the quality of the food (pulled chicken, pulled pork, beans, coleslaw, &amp; potato salad). &#160;There was more than enough supplied which was nice for leftovers.SERVICE: &#160;very friendly and helpful. &#160;It seems like they are pretty busy with other events, but we had only one problem with billing on our order and it was resolved very professionally and quickly.I would definitely use them again for catering a backyard event. Outside of Peco's Pit &amp; Jones, Seattle is quite foreign to barbecue. I grew up in the midwest with some of the best barbecue in the world, and Smokin' Pete's completely misses. In barbecue, its all about the flavor of the sauce, and their sauce is bland and flavorless at best. They don't offer typical side dishes and how they cook their meat leaves more to be desired. Definitely look elsewhere in the city for barbecue. Delicious. If you want a bbq place that reminds you how to feature the meat, and not the sauce, go here. I dig the walkup counter, do-it-yourself feel of the place. All the sides are tasty, but the meat is centerstage and I recommend getting a plateful as often as possible. Have been there three times and have not seen the bad service others have. Love that it is in the neighborhood. Oh, and the chocolate pecan pie shouldn't be missed. Unless you'd rather order more brisket instead. Very surprised at all the negative reviews, so I had to weigh in.I was born in Kansas, lived in Texas, and moved here a few years ago from Chicago. so BBQ has always been a staple meal for me. While there are places out here that have tasty sauces, there's more to BBQ than the sauce which is why I'm so happy I found Smokin Pete's.If you're going to sandwiches nothing beats the pulled pork, but there's something awesome about getting a few pounds of their mouth-watering brisket and taking it home to dress up in your preferred method.I remember going in for a sandwich and trying all the sauces, but the regular sauce is a delicious standard, I don't remember the others standing out as well as the regular sauce (which is also sold by the bottle).And I just made myself so hungry thinking about it that I'm going to go get one now.
I love this place for many reasons. &#160;Now that Vince's in Rainier Beach closed, this is the closest pizza place to my home. &#160;Well, at least it is the closest place that I will step foot in. &#160;The fact that it is owned by the same family that owned Vince's is a plus. &#160;But this is not recycled pizza from up the road. &#160;It is the same style of pizza served by Tutta Bella, but I think it is better. &#160;The ambiance is better than Tutta Bella. &#160;Much more comfortable. &#160;Order a carafe of wine and it will come in a ceramic pitcher. &#160;The salads are first rate and very large. &#160;My wife and I find splitting a Small Caesar and one pizza is plenty. &#160;But we usually order two pies, so we have plenty of left overs. You have to try this place! Food was pretty good. I had the Sorrento, substituted the prosciutto w/sausage and I liked it a lot. My bf loves Vince's minestrone, so we got a bowl to share and I didn't think it was that great. Not sure why he is so excited about it, just basic tomato soup w/ some veggies. I actually like my bf's homemade minestrone better. The little complementary slices of bread were okay, but kinda too crunchy and not super flavorful.The pizza itself I would give a 4. I would not come here for anything else. What dropped this to a 3 was the hassle that came with bill splitting. We had a party of 24, with pretty obvious splits between couples. I mean, we all sat in pairs or respective groups, and at the end, they took the WHOLE bill, divided it by 9 and randomly handed them to 9 people (some couples, some singles). So, we had to mark up how much should be put on what credit card and at the end I think one person had to just absorb the remainder. That sucked. I never understand how in this world of technology how bill splitting can be a difficult thing. Mmmm, saucy. As a pizza connoisseur, I generally rate pizza based on how much I like the sauce and how well they do a Margherita pizza. Pulcinella is right up there with Via Tribunali in my book. Not only did I love the sauce, but they didn't skimp. It was REALLY saucy. I liked it a lot. I also had a mixed green salad that was delicious albeit a little on the oily side. It didn't bother me but I could definitely see it buggin' some obsessive calorie counters. And fresh warm bread with oil and balsalmic vinegar! Yum. I'll definitely be back for one of their Friday night happy hours with live music and $3 pizzettes! I was on my way to an art show and starving! &#160;I hadn't eaten for 6 hours and I stumbled across Pulcinella Pizzeria. &#160;My intention was to buy a slice and go. &#160;I was in quite a hurry. &#160;The waitress politely told me there were no slices. &#160;And pointed me toward the menu.Options:A: $6 sub sandwich (need it fast!!!)B: $6+ personal pizza. (thought it would take too long)I chose option A, the sub sandwich.  It was so delicious, I calmed down and ate it slowly, and enjoyed it. &#160;I pocketed my cell phone and forgot about how busy I was.After the sandwich was gone, I pondered the menu and ordered a personal &#160;pizza in addition... it comes with a cup of delicious minestroni soup ($1 extra, YES ONE DOLLAR) or a small salad for $1 extra (YES ONE DOLLAR) BABE this place knows how to make Neapolitan pizza! &#160;I was wowed.I hung out and ate the whole thing. And spoke with the waitress Gabriela at length about the history there. &#160;Turns out her grandpa opened up Vince's ( the papa company) and this business is a family operation. &#160; Go! &#160;Eat! &#160;Enjoy! &#160;GREAT PLACE TO HAVE BUSINESS LUNCH!!! &#160;I will have my next business rendezvous there! &#160;Wow. &#160;Definitely worth the drive.Take your time! &#160;Smell the roses and enjoy the pizza! wow.ps - the deserts look scrumptious, but i was a bit to full to try them this time!Cheers Dears! I love pizza. It's one of two non-chain places in Washington State that is certified by the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana. So of course, we skipped the Insalate e Antipasti. &#160;All of our pizzas were perfect. Crispy yet soft flat crust pizza, with oozy mozzarella and quality ingredients.Margherita - it's a classic and the original pizzaVomero - Tomato, Mozzarella, Prosciutto, ArugulaSorrento - &#160;with Prosciutto, Mushrooms, Olives, Capers, BasilGiovanni - with Pesto Sauce, Pepperoni, Sausage, MushroomService was great. Quality takes time. Good for birthdays! SOME DAMN GOOD NEAPOLITAN PIZZA!In the Renton/Rainier Beach/Columbia City/Seward Park area this is by far the best pizza in the area and yes it's better than that flying squirrel place. What makes a damn good pizza you ask? Below is what I look for in a pizza:#1 CRUST: For me, the first thing I notice is the dough texture - Pulcinella Pizzeria is a thin tender pizza with just enough chewiness mixed with a good outer crustiness that doesn't weigh you down and has good flavor void of excess flour/chemical flavors that spoils most pizza crusts out there. #2 SAUCE: A bad tomato sauce can ruin my pizza experience. Here are some sauce fails: Chunky sauces, too much garlic, no flavor sauces, &amp; &#160;sauces taste like ketchup. At Pulcinella you have a tasty light fresh tomato sauce that doesn't over power the toppings or the crust. Win!#3 TOPPINGS: High quality meats, fresh veggies, and a good good mozzarella are the key to a fantastic pizza. Pulcinella does a good job here. #4 OILINESS: I don't need heartburn or an upset stomach. Easy on the oil but a little quality extra virgin olive oil drizzle does add flavor. #5 OVERALL FLAVOR: At Pulcinella every pizza is well balanced with complimentary flavors that's made fresh to order. It's one of those pizzas were I could inhale the entire pie by myself. To be honest I think it's one of the best pizzas in the Seattle area. Thank you Jesus for Pulcinella Pizzeria in the hood. We ventured to this restaurant on the recommendation of a friend. &#160;It's a bit out of the way, but we don't regret the drive and giving this place a shot. &#160;The pizza was pretty delicious. &#160;The restaurant is inviting with the roaring fire in the pizza oven and the view of Lake Washington. &#160;The pizza stacks up pretty well against some of the other good pizza restaurants in Seattle (Tutta Bella and Bar Del Corso) for Neopolitan pizza. &#160;I had their Puttanesca pizza (olives, rapini, capers, and anchovies, tomato sauce, no cheese), which was so salty and wonderful. &#160;If salty food is your style, this is one awesome pizza.My wife had another one of their special pizzas (white sauce, pepperoni, parmigiano reggiano) which was very rich and good. &#160;She also had their signature dessert (lemon cream and lemoncello swirl) which was delightful. &#160;The restaurant is clean and inviting and the noise level isn't bad. &#160;This is a great little place. Fun spot .. We went here for an informal day of Birthday celebration it was our 1st time and we are sold..have been back 2 more times since.Great friendly and attentive staff.Ambiance is nice, high ceilings, gorgeous wood bar and phenomenal wood-fired pizza oven.Margherita Pizza with italian sausage added A+Mario is very good Puttanesca if your in the mood for salty olives and anchoviesSteamed clams are done to perfection in the pizza oven. Best pizza I've had in my life. Better than Tutta Bella, and in my opinion- Serious Pie. I've frequented this place around once a month for around 2 years now, they've never disappointed me. I come here with my friends, girlfriend, and even family. It's always perfect. If you want a break from the same old pizza from the chain pizzeria's, this is your place! &#160;It is so good, that I crave it on my way home from work and will drive an extra 20 minutes to get it. &#160;Just enough time to call in an order. &#160;If you are not into pizza, they have a Italian sandwich for lunch that is extremely delicious for like $7 bucks. &#160;Totally worth it! &#160;You owe it to your self to become addicted to this place too. &#160; &#160;See you in rehab. I went here with 2 girlfriends and we had a late lunch - it was great! The space is romantic without being stuffy, light and bright with good seating, fun bar space, clean bathrooms, and some tasty choices! The lunch menu is awesome - great prices and quick service. I'd go back for sure! I came for an early Sunday dinner with my mate and our toddler. Very nice soft buzz in place, waiters and cooks who are seemingly well treated and content with their employer gives a relaxed enjoyable air. Warm decor which i don't find at all at other pizzerias with pricier menus, like the overly popular tutta bella down the street. The magherita pizza was nicely browned on the bottom the way we love it. PERONI on tap and served in tall peroni glasses makes for a reason to come back! The simple mixed greens was the best salad I've had in Seattle - simple and nicely balanced between acid and alkaline. Being a family of savory lovers, dessert was a simple but ooh so rich eggplant parm &#160;which came to the table with it's fine cheesy &#160;edges literally carmalized onto the hot plate,(eastcoast style +). Perfect Sunday meal, thankyou Pulcinella Pizzeria!
I love pho. &#160;I've been eating pho since the I was a little kid in the 80's, so I've been "around" when it comes to this Vietnamese soup dish. &#160;My first impression of Than Bros was positive. &#160;They seat and take your order quickly, and also bring you out these delicious cream puffs. &#160;The pho here is pretty cheap. &#160;I ordered a large and was pretty surprised at how big it was. &#160;It kind of scared me for a second. &#160;As for the soup or broth, it was only "ok" and I felt unsatisfied after I finished. &#160;Something was missing in the soup, but I really couldn't tell. &#160;Maybe there wasn't enough cilantro in the soup. &#160;Anyway, plus for cheap prices and those delicious cream puffs, minus for the lack of something within the soup. It is a rainy cold weather favorite... but the university district location is better. We usually order a small veggie and chicken- they are about $5 each with tax. We only do take out and last night they had it to us in about 2 minutes. Imagine- a huge container of cilantro, onion, mushrooms, and noodles + a large soup container AND a container with a cream puff and beansprouts and side items such as lime and mint leaves. Heck yes! This convenient location has us coming back whenever we want something fun, filling, hot, and fast. It's not the best but it hits the spot. Plus they really are the only pho place close by that does a veggie version that I can eat* I have been conquered by the evil that is FLU. It has racked my brain and made me wish I were dead. The only relief in sight is hot and spicy soup. Hooray for Pho! I had a medium pho with eye of round and tripe and poured in the sriracha until I was sweating out the evil. And I felt better. For about an hour. But I still felt better. And I thank you, Brothers Than, for that! A dish that will fill you up and keep you warm for under $5 AND a cream puff for dessert - these are some of the reasons why Than Brothers is so awesome.I usually get the Tai (raw beef) and the soup is the best. I will slurp all of it up until the last drop. The meet is not fatty. I have gone to other places where I have gotten Tai and the meet was fatty, maybe this adds to the flavor but I like a nice non-oily pho.And the cream puffs. It's always a nice little treat after OR before the pho. I just got a tray of 15 for $7.50 for a party. Everyone loved it. It's the perfect size and not too sweet or too bland but just right.Don't forget your cash. That's all they take.
Great food. Super strong drinks. Relatively friendly staff, and they move fairly quick on a busy night. Mornings there aint half bad either.Only problem is the crowd migrates to more frat party style Fall-Spring cause of Seattle U nearby. Has a cool vibe otherwise. I love Linda's for the simple fact it has a later Happy Hour. It STARTS at 7 and goes until 9. Genius! Their drinks are also strong. For me that is an added bonus, but to others it may be a warning. I also love the patio, there are spots of both sun and shade, plus they have pitchers of Mimosa's, I could spend all day there in the summer...and I have. It's not the most gorgeous spot, and I would not recommend it if your looking for romantic ambiance and a quiet setting. However, if you are looking for cheap pitchers of beer and $3 sliders at 8pm with a rowdy group of friends, then yeah, check out Linda's. As a bar, Linda's is so pretentious. Unless you're a cutesy hipster white girl, staff and clients ignore you. As a brunch place, the food is between 'ok' (mimosa pitchers, hash browns) and 'gross cardboard' (biscuits). Go there for happy hour when the beer is cheap. The happy hour sliders are super tasty and it's a relatively fun relaxed crowd (until you have to wait in line to use the restroom). Unless you are on a mission to drink a pitcher of mimosa, there's really no reason to wait in line to get brunch there though. I could have made a better brunch at home even if I were still wasted from the night before. Bland and crappy and you will probably be sober enough to realize how grimy it is in there. So yeah, stick to Linda's after the sun goes down and you're a little liquored up. good place to start the night or a great place to just enjoy a beer and some fries. get the onion rings! beer battered and delicious with beer.i like u so much (or maybe its cuz i'm poor) that i drank my beer out in the patio in the cold. but they do have heat lamps out there and it is smoker friendly.happy hour is from 7-9 pm ($3 wells and beer, $7.50 pitchers, $2 pints and $5.50 pitchers of PBR, $3 sliders). DO IT!and dress casual. is it me or is the bouncer always "reading" a book? the good--+bloody mary's+heavy pours+cheap happy hour+the veggie jack burger+the patio (during summer, anyway)the bad---good luck finding a table on a weekend-good luck finding a table during happy hourthe wait staff is always working hard and they have a ton of shit to do so BE PATIENT. being nice gets your drinks to the table faster, just sayin'. I've been to Linda's once before. My experience was pleasant and the veggie sandwich I had was quite delicious but I found no appealing qualities of Linda's to compel me to go there again. I found myself there once more on an early Thursday evening for a pal's birthday get together. At about 4:30p.m. on a Thursday, Linda's was fairly empty. No complaints from me there since the last time I stepped foot in the joint it was packed to the rim. The absence of hipsters was a relief to me as well. I went up to the counter to order my beer. I choose the beer that had a St. Bernard dog's head on the tap. The barkeep pulled down the lever and my cup was full of foam. It was keg changing time but I told her to switch my beers because I didn't feel like waiting for a cold one. I settled on a Hamm's. I decided to get some food and browsed the menu. I immediately found the nachos and decided to get those. Being the nacho lover that I am, I am willing to try them once anywhere. You get the option of having regular ol' meat chili or vegetarian chili. I got my cow free and waited for them to come. About 10 minutes later I get my nachos which are loaded with multi-colored chips and loaded with beans. I dug and was disappointed. The chips had no flavor and the beans were missing some &#160;spices. I didn't even finish the nachos which is sacrilegious to me. I can't remember the last time I didn't finish a meal.As the night drew on it began to get crowded signaling it was time to go. Linda's isn't bad but there are plenty of other bars I'd go to over this one. Always get great service here. They were doing a cool auction tonight that benefited the Vera Project, an all-ages music venue. Think the owners also own King's in Ballard. The two bars have a pretty similar feel... Both have a little rustic kitschy decor, cold tall boys, and nice outdoor decks in the back. Check out Linda's Cobb Salad if you're in the mood for it. Really good. After almost 3 years of Yelping and 625 reviews... I come to find that I've yet to write up the place that took my YelpLife from online to offline.Linda's was the scene of my very first Yelp Happy Hour.I do believe that the night consisted of stops at The Capitol Club, Linda's, and Summit Ale House, but I cannot be sure. It was a lot of fun though. I won't ever forget it. With all the sentimental values I place on instances like this, I wish I had lots of great things to say about Linda's... I don't. It's not that it's bad. It's just not that good.In my opinion, the place used to be a whole lot better than it is now. But maybe that's just me. I do like the patio on a summer day or sitting at the bar that's never too busy when they first open.This haiku summarizes my feelings perfectly.Bartenders be cold,And the ale be colder.Vegetarian bacon? YES YOU CAN.Ballroom remodel, if you please... Fabled to be the last place Kirk Cobain was seen alive, Linda's is the original hipster hive. &#160;I like getting a drink there just to see who is in, The best part of lindas is the servers and door people genuinely friendly and welcoming. Best bet is to hit the patio in the summer. &#160;I encourage anyone visiting Seattle to go for a hangover breakfast and play my favorite game...."Who hooked up last night" &#160; Take note you may want to wear hip waders if you plan on using the restroom while you are there, Just FYI." Best. Bloody. Marys. Around.Come here if you need to do some drinking at brunch. &#160;Beyond the bloody marys and the pitchers of mimosas, Linda's is just okay. &#160;Food is okay, the patio is crowded if there is a glimmer of sunlight, its hard to get a place to sit after 6pm. &#160;It gets loud. &#160;The bathrooms are usually pretty gross. &#160;It caters to a younger drinking crowd, which fluctuates between fun and obnoxious. &#160;Happy hour is at the ever accommodating 7-9pm, and drink prices are reasonable. I can't believe I haven't Yelped about Linda's yet. I just came from there, however, so now is as good a time as any.The first time I went to Linda's, I ordered a rum and diet and about died. It was SO strong. Since then I've learned my lesson and stick to beer - I can't speak for any of the other mixed drinks. &#160;They seem to have a decent beer selection from what I've seen, though.I love the fact that they have an outdoor section, although that place is FREEEEZING at night! Thank God for the heaters they have out there. &#160;Tonight I finally tried some of their food, and I wasn't disappointed. I ordered the grilled cheese with tomato, and my one complaint was that there only seemed to be about one tomato slice per half-sandwich, meaning that part of the time there was NO tomato when I bit into my sandwich and part of the time there was. It came with fries that were pretty good, plus a pickle! All for about $6, so not a bad deal. The big complaint? The service. Maybe it was because we were outside, maybe they were just unexpectedly busy, but we had to seek someone out to request a food menu, and then they took forever to ask for our order, and then forever to bring us the food. About halfway through our meal, my boyfriend requested another beer, which didn't come until well after we'd finished eating. They were quick getting the check to us, so who knows what was going on there. &#160;So hey, Linda's is a good place - so far not great, not amazing, but not bad, either. I'll be back, I'm sure. Not the first to yelp...Won't be the last...Used to be a regular...Now it' s in the past...Oh Linda's we have memories...Some good some bad...You're still the queen of the hill...All the hipsters, don't get mad...SHUT UP AND ENJOY YOUR DRINK....and don't forget to tip your bartender... Here's how it went:I showed up and my buddy told me he would take care of the tab for the table. He was paying for three of us.The other two guys each had 2-3 rum and cokes.I had 2 beers. Between the three of us, it added up to $21.50. Only $21.50. I didn't feel guilty about having him take care of the whole tab. This is recession-priced drinking, friends. It might have been a math mistake, but I love Linda's Tavern.(Oh, also I liked the look of the place, the jukebox ruled, and I had fun) There is nothing really in particular wrong with Linda's, I have just never been a fan. The food is okay, and so is the patio, and I go every now and then just because.I will just never love it here for some reason. I don't dislike Lindas at all but it's a bar I typically avoid. The drinks are good and the prices are totally reasonable but the bar is SO DAMN CROWDED! Plus, I swear I see the same people in there each time I go. Linda's whole scene kinda make my skin crawl. I get the feeling when I walk in that everyone's looking at me thinking they're so cool. It's like a stare down and then you can't find a seat. Awkward!You end up being shuffled outside because it's the only place there's any room to stand without being bumped into contstantly. &#160;I don't really love standing in the smoking area but that's all there is when you don't get there before 8pm to snag a table or a booth.Another no-no is the bathroom situation. Plan WAY ahead because there's only one bathroom per sex and there's always a line.All in all it's not a terrible bar but I feel like it's the hip bar to go to the minute you turn 21. OH!! Their brunch is tasty though! :) Oh Linda's how I miss you! This is a great place for a group. Lots of booths and tables. The wings are amazing and cheap! The only reason i give this place 4 stars and not 5 is because the bathroom is way to small... only one stall... BOOOOother then that!! i love the scene, lots of hipsters that seem to be lost in a ho-dunk kinda bar... i love it!!! it was crowded on a tuesday night, i can't even imagine what it would be like on a friday or saturday!! there was a place in the back outside to smoke and drink and they had heaters... BIG plus for me... i don't like to be cold. The place was a little too warm inside and i don't know if thats a good or bad thing... I like to be warm, but when i'm a little toasty, that could be a problem for others... I stuck with Mannys... no whiskey for me, although i'm sure the drinks would have been stiff... :)i'll be back for sure... probably this weekend ;)
Pretty..., pretty....., pretty......, pretty......, pretty......., PRETTY GOOD. Generous portions. Adequate yellow curry with a little sweetness. No fresh vegetables or even vegetables with any color (just pale potatoes and pale canned bamboo shoots). Good lunch value. I decided to give this place a try because I found it on Pirq. I ordered the food for 5 to go. I got a curry dish, phad thai, drunken noodle, and their special fried chicken dish, which I love!!! Like I said, I found this place on Pirq, so I used the deal and I got all that food for really cheap. I'm Thai and I like going to different Thai restaurants to get the most authentic food I can get here. This place is somewhat authentic, not THAT authentic. Then again, I haven't come across any Thai restaurants that I go "oh my god, it tastes just like home!!!".Conclusion: good food, good quantity, and good price. Friendly service, fast, and tasty. The pad thai, panang curry, basil chicken, and garlic chicken are good. (I like chicken here; the pork and beef not so much.) But I have to say, I recently tried Thai Tom, and it kicks just about every other Thai place on the Ave out of the water. This is my go-to Thai place on the Ave. The portions are good for the price, especially during happy hour (where some of the selected menu items are cheaper from 3PM-5PM). I really love the Panang Curry here. It has alot of meat &amp; veggies and the curry is really rich &amp; creamy. I've also had the pad-thai which is average and the tom yum soup was pretty good. There is a better place for that, but this place is good overall.They recently re-decorated the inside and it's really nice. The tables/chairs, dining ware, and atmosphere. This place is kind of hit or miss with the food. I really like the phad kee mao but the phad thai is pretty bad. The service is really good though. They're always nice and food comes out pretty fast. I think it's much better if you dine in than take out. Worth a try if you're in the area. Not thrilled with the beef phad see yew or the Thai iced tea. The latter was way too sweet and had too little of the iced-tea taste. I suppose that means too much of the condensed milk and sugar. As for the main dish, everything just seemed overdone (with the exception of the broccoli). The rice noodles were clumpy in the extreme (probably the most disappointing part). The beef was pretty flavorless. And the sauce was thick.It's possible some of their other dishes are better, but I think phad see yew is pretty standard and should come out pretty well no matter where you go. So I'm rather disappointed.I was also surprised the server didn't even offer to box up my leftovers for me -- she just handed me a box with a plastic bag inside. I actually do like boxing up my own stuff, but do expect the server to at least offer first. Atmosphere is clean, service is fast, everything in that area is fine.As for the food....I ordered the "Garlic". Which was basically chicken and vegetables in a garlic sauce. The garlic they used was clearly that nasty, pre-chopped kind that is in some sort of marinade/preservative/pickling liquid. Basically the kind that comes in a jar, you have to keep in the fridge, the kind people that don't ever cook use when a recipe calls for garlic..... As you can imagine (or have experienced yourself) there is a huge flavor difference between this type of garlic and the fresh kind. And ohhhhh boy you could taste it in this dish. Very strange tasting, and absolutely covered in these little chunks of pre-chopped, marinated yucky garlic. I mean.... come on!!!! The dish is called "garlic", use some quality ingredients!!!! This was the type of meal that when you think back on it it actually makes you slightly nauseous. Blehhhh.My boyfriend got the pad-thai and wasn't impressed with it at all. I tried a bite of it and it definitely didn't taste like any pad-thai I had ever had before (which can be good, I'm all for new things, but this was not a good "new"). I only had one bite, so I can't pinpoint exactly what was different about it, but it definitely wasn't something you would want to eat a whole plate of. Maybe we just tried the wrong things? I'm not sure, but I do know we won't be back again. Horrible service and DO NOT USE THE PIRQ app here, they charge a 20% tip fee which is not included in the terms of conditions. Totally illegal. Horrible experience and food.
After reading the reviews I am intrigued. I believe the issue may be that the place is a front for some other business and that's why they act like customers are a bother - they are. Now why make a gluten free bakery and not some other type of business as a front you ask - because they thought the gluten free would limit their walk in business. The other theory I have is that gluten free people are just so damn annoying that they are sick of dealing with them. I'm going to go check it out and report back. On a mission...So after going twice now, I have not experienced any mean spirited customer service, although the woman in question was not behind the counter. (I thought perhaps she was on her computer in the front of the store, only to disappear when i walked in. Perhaps i was recognized!) So the customer service was just fine, it's the offerings I'm not entirely "yay, i'm a fan" fan of. I do appreciate the fact that they are making savory treats. I was very excited by the proscuitto spinach cheese "danish" as the young man called it. It was the closest thing I've had to some type of italian stromboli in a while. It was good, crumbly when warmed, but good (they need a toaster, only have a microwave and a george forman for some reason). Here's my complaint that goes for the $9 bread I purchased as well - I don't think it's very healthy at all. I taste what seems to be a lot of butter or something similar that can make bad bread taste good. Everything just seems really greasy to me. Even the "pitas" they were making for Romio's pizzeria looked it. I get it though - they had to do something, but perhaps further experimentation could make it less artery clogging. After eating a slice of the bread I did have what felt like a doughy lump in my stomach. I wouldn't recommend a sandwich on this stuff. And honestly, their savory case which houses all the pizza slices and other cheese filled goodness needs help! It is so unappetizing - everything looks like it's been sitting for a month. They need to freshen that up - i didn't even bother getting anything from it.I don't like sweet baked goods so take someone else's opinion on those, and I didn't sit down for breakfast. For my taste it was just okay.PS - could still be a front because it's kind of in no man's land up on Greenwood and 100th. Only the desperate will travel for this place. Everything is wheat free, others are marked DF (dairy free) EF (egg free) and SF (soy free). &#160;My non-restricted spouse thought his baked item (lemon lavender cake) was fine, but noted his mocha was actually better than average, perhaps because they're blending their own chocolate.I was grateful and happy for my tasty treats after being treatless, and glad they double checked (though maybe not empathetic-ally) in response to my anxious queries about dairy for every non-labeled item (and even when I called back later). &#160;I think reviewers are a bit tough on them for not being our soul mates the moment we walk in, it's easy to expect that since we are in theory united in our wheat-less-ness against a larger unsympathetic world. &#160;It strikes me that being a restricted-diet bakery means your target market is the pickiest group of eaters in town (I know I'm a waitperson's worst nightmare right now) - that's gotta be a tough biz some days.It's small, I'm thinking they could seat 12 people at most? Only seen a few at a time. &#160;Have pastries, lots of sweet breads. &#160;french bread and pizza crusts to go. &#160;Espressos (nondairy milks too) and teas. &#160;I figured out how to bike there, it will become one of my staple routes. (ballard hills!) I haven't had much luck thus far with any small family owned gluten free bakery - and I've been to a couple in the state of Washington. The customer service is the number one reason I give this bakery two stars. It seems like a family run business who hires their teenage/young "kids" to do the face to face customer service, coffee and ringing people up. The kids are seemingly inexperienced and know little about the products. When my Mom and I went there (my mom is lactose and gluten intolerant) I asked the guy at the register what the samples were and he couldn't answer the question. If you're going to put on samples, label them, or at least know what you're serving, especially if you're running a business that caters to people with sensitivies and allergies. The other issue I have with DaVinci's/Wheatless in Seattle is their pastry case. Completely unnappealing. Dim lighting and lacking in the cleanliness department is a turn off when it comes to food - they should take a few tips from Starbucks or any other cafe/deli chain. Granted they probably don't have the money that big chains do, they could at least get a clue! The case that displays most of their sandwiches is also pretty gross looking. I got the feeling they just threw the place together without a real design or level of comfort.You can also see the kitchen from the register which is kind of weird to me. I think that part of the business should stay "mysterious" if that makes any sense. It's like being seated by the kitchen in a restaurant - it kind of takes away from the appeal of going out of your own house to eat. If I wanted to hear dishes, pots and pans being clanked around, I would just make myself dinner at home! And miss out on having to tip!They do have good food. They have a french bread that is absolutely delicious and same goes for their pastries. Like one other poster said, you can tell the pastries are fattening. But, everything in moderation, huh? I stopped by five minutes after closing Monday evening to pick up some goods for a birthday gathering. &#160;The owner told me not to worry about running late. I got a grab bag of several different muffins, cookies and cake and even got a couple tastes of some other items. I set out the plate of goodies in front of the birthday girl, her husband and kids and they loved everything, especially the lemon cake.I found these baked good to be very light in texture, not typical of gluten free items I've had before, which can be heavy. If you're driving by at night, beware the building is dark except for a bright Open sign! Otherwise it's very easy to park. the Mission: a vegan cake with dairy-free frosting for my gluten-free friend's bday. mission accomplished! &#160;what a vegan/gluten-free/soy free/egg-free lovers delight!the baker was helpful when i gave in my call-in order. and she called me back to make sure if it was okay that the frosting was dairy-free.fyi, the bakery/cafe still has the old bakery name, Da Vinci's Cafe on it. so i drove by it when i was trying to look for it and had to turn around. i also think its adorable their coffee drinks are named after seattle neighborhoods. thanks yelp for helping me this birthday cake a success! Absolutely love the seed bread and the shortbread cookies! &#160;Everything else I've had here has also been totally amazing. &#160;WIS beats Flying Apron any day. &#160;Sorry FA, but it's true...Romio's on 85th &amp; Greenwood has a whole GF menu thanks to this place.
We went here because someone gave us a coupon for buy-one-get-one-free entree, and it seemed like it could be good. They were able to seat us quickly and without a reservation, which was nice. They served us complimentary bread and... roasted garlic YUM. The roasted garlic was almost enough to earn this place an additional star. It was that good. Unfortunately, it was probably also the best part of the meal. We ordered the small caesar salad, the gnocchi appetizer, the lasagna and the pollo parmagiana. The salad was fine. Unremarkable, but okay. So hubby and I came down split on the Gnocchi though. He liked it. I thought it was a little too mushy. (I prefer a slightly firmer gnocchi). The sauce was pretty tasty however, and this dish was probably my favorite after the bread.The Lasagna, was okay, but also unremarkable. The Pollo Parmagiana was a mix. The Pollo part was yummy, can't really go wrong with breaded and fried chicken, lol. But the pasta was overcooked and again, the sauce was unremarkable. It was served with a side of veggies that was pretty good though. Overall, with the coupon, I'd say it was worth the price. But I wouldn't go back and pay full price for what we received. In fact, there wasn't really anything I'd go back for, except the bread and garlic, and honestly, I can easily do that at home so... yeah, not really baaaaad... but not great either. Not bad for what I call and old school italian-american pasta house. &#160;I didn't care for the anti pasto plate but my pasta was acceptable. chicken pesto con penne!
Mixed beef pho was very tasty. Chicken in the chicken pho was kinda dry but the broth was good. Prawn/taro spring roll was kinda weird, taro was too mushy I think.But seriously, the fresh tangerine juice... wow... just wow. So refreshing and delicious!And they only charge .75 cents for tea, which makes me happy! Wow this is a hidden gem here on the hillI have seen this place many times as I park in the upstairs parking lot when I go to QFC but the other day the bf's like hey they have Pho, I was like really now and its good too he says. so we head over there to eat the other day, I have been like 3 times now and ever time I have tried different stuff, and I have been happy that we went there each time, I had heard a few horror stories from friends when I mentioned this place, but none of them have happened to me so I will keep going here I am sure, and there base for the Pho is damn yummy Solid Vietnamese food from friendly folks. Service is efficient and speedy. &#160;I usually get the vermicelli with lemongrass tofu. &#160;Restaurant is bright and cheery. &#160;They also have great tofu salad rolls. WOW! This place is looking tres chic with it's fancy white dishes and it is mighty clean to boot! I could probably eat off the floor it is so clean. But don't worry I wont. The few times I've been here I've ordered the rare beef pho and all three times it has been amazingly sooooo yummy! The price might be a little bit more then I usually pay but the beef is so very tender and not all chewy. I'm not sure if mama Ling Ling is in the back bangin the hell out of her meat to make it so tender or they just buy better quality of beef. I've also had a nibble of Boobers (Robert S.) mongolian chicken and that was mighty yummers too. I would give the place 5 stars but they don't have cream puffs. *In fob accent* So yeah if mama Ling Ling make dis honolawee fob cleam puff mama Ling Ling get da 5 stah. Just had dinner here for the first time - vegetarian pho with mock chicken. Considering how close this is to my apartment and how tasty the soup was, I think I'll be coming back often!
Went here for lunch last week for the first time with a few other people. &#160;I think the prices were decent for the quality and quantity of food. &#160;It's comparable to Azteca, maybe a tad bit better, but the flavors are very similar. &#160;Serving sizes were quite large to me, but I'm a bit smaller than the average person. &#160;They'll definately satisfy your hunger. &#160;The service was alright. &#160;I didn't have to wait too long if I needed extra salsa and what not, but they weren't too busy at the time we had eaten there. &#160;One of the people I went with said it was busier than usual though that time than other times they've went.Everytime I go to a Mexican restaurant, I always go for the enchiladas or the chimichanga. &#160;This time I went for the enchiladas. &#160;Here they serve you with three instead of the usual two, and they're the same size as most restaurants, so that's got to be a plus. &#160;Everyone else that went appeared to enjoy the food, and didn't have much to complain about. &#160;But then again, it wasn't anything too special either. &#160;It really is like an Azteca with a great location Downtown on the Harbor Steps. &#160;I can't wait to try it in the summer when the balcony is open. I love their salsa and chips! The food is okay, but I've had much better. &#160;The drinks are on the expensive side. Only came in for dessert and beer... The drinks are a tad expensive, the flan wasn't very good, and the service was quite terrible. &#160;Took forever to get the beer and even longer to get the check. &#160;I was ready to just walk out. &#160;They have a nice patio, but other than that, not very many redeeming qualities. Drinks are a tad expensive (4.50 for most beer, 8-9 for margaritas). Good service, but lacking a selection of drinks. Food was OK, but had no spice. Unless you live in Harbor Step, not worth the money IMO. I got the lunch special today (two chorizo tacos on corn tortillas and rice/beans). &#160;It was not great Mexican food, but it's not bad either. &#160;For a cheap ($5-6) take-out lunch it was decent enough. &#160;Very average overall. I am gonna give this place 3 stars because they make a decent Margarita and their patio is kickass on a nice day. That being said, their food is not very good, if you must eat here, order the &#160;chicken Enchilada, its the best thing on thier menu. I live in Harbor Steps directly above this place so I come here more than I should. If you are in a pinch and need something quick, this is your spot. Best bet is to come here on a warm day and sit outside and have a rita and much on their chips and salsa. I will say this in their defense, this place is no worse than any other Mexican joint in Seattle. Its just not the right town for Mexican, what else can I say?
Il Fornaio is your basic chain-style restaurant, but not slugging it out down in the trenches with Marie Callenders and TGI Friday's. &#160;They have more class than that. &#160;They just look down their noses at those places and hurl day-old bread rolls at them.Super professional wait staff. &#160;Our waiter wore a white jacket, and spoke with a thick Italian accent, giving the feel of eating in an Italian bistro. &#160;Every part of our meal, from bread to polenta, was excellent. &#160;They accommodated the stripped down dietary needs of our son, and were engaging the whole time. &#160;Top notch! The il Fornaio Cafe located in the center of Westlake center is my favorite place to grab a quick salad for energey in between a shopping frenzy. &#160;It is fast, choose your lettuce, choose toppings, around 20 to choose from, choose dressing, and they mix it all up put in in a bowl, scarf scarf and back to shopping! &#160;They have soup, sanwiches and pastry too, I have never tried, they look good though. &#160;Cost, about $7 for a very filling salad. One of my daughter's favorite places in Seattle. Good salads and pasta dishes. I usually order the vegetarian pizza - nice thin and crispy crust. Very good bread... be careful not to fill up before the main meal ;-) Upstairs and downstairs have very different vibes. It's worth trying both. Yummy Italian, but not what I'd term spectacular. Very nice ambiance, attentive and courteous waitstaff. Highly romantic- a great date place. The penne pasta is boring, go out on a limb and try something a bit more risque!
Went here last month for a friend's birthday party. &#160;Staff was super friendly and they had a good selection of drinks. &#160;They also had really good prices - their happy hour is pretty nice.I agree with some of the other reviewers here though - this bar isn't really Irish. &#160;If so, it's the least Irish bar I've ever been to. &#160;Most pubs I've seen don't have pool tables or karaoke.It's also pretty dark and dirty, in my opinion. &#160;Not that most bars aren't dark or slightly dingy...but this place just had more of a filthy feeling to me.Overall, however, I had a good time here and I'd come back. Seattle-Friend: "So...where you dudes wanna go next?"Me: "Somewhere chilled out, man. Somewhere we can talk and not have to worry about douchey soundtracks, being mean-mugged by the well-dressed peeps at the next table over...just a hang-out. Oh, and somewhere with a decent beer-list."Seattle-Friend: "Alright...let's hit this dive I go to sometimes. Dubliner. Irish in name only. They have beer."Me: "Lead the way!"Attention Indiana dive bars...take note! One tap of High Life, a power-plant-esque smoke cloud, and Nascar flags does not make you a dive; it makes you a shitty bar. Seattle "dives" have it down; multiple taps of at-least-decent brew, no smoking, soccer on a couple dim-corner big screens...yeah, this is a new definition I can get behind. Cold pitchers of 3 Skulls Wit, friendly bartenders, a rather clean joint, subdued 10pm on a Thursday night, catching up with old friends. Aw yeah. We overstayed by a pitcher...not a bad decision at all. My thought on the Dubliner is, "Meh. I've experienced better." The drinks were fine, the bartender was fine, and the other customers didn't really interact with me. If that was where the review stopped, I'd have given it 3 stars.What took it down to two stars is the smell. I don't know if its just the few times I've been there but it always smells like a guys locker room. I'm doubt a bar has too much control over its customers bathing habits, but its still enough to keep me away. ** Happy Hour Review **The food earns them three stars at best, but you don't come to an Irish pub for the food: you come for the cheap drinks, with rowdy groups of friends, and you make the most of every minute of that generous 3-8pm Happy Hour window (EVERY DAY, and Sundays 1-10pm!). &#160;The microbrews are good and cheap, $3.50/pint during HH, with $2 PBR and $3 well drinks. &#160;Like I said, the food isn't anything special, but it'll do to cushion all those cheap drinks. &#160;Start your Fremont adventures here and save the classier (or at least more expensive) places for later. &#160;Your wallet will thank me; your hangover, maybe not. Love the Dub. If you are a local Fremonter, you sure know what the Bellevue shore, fist pumping, pink polo wearing douches do to the neighborhood on a weekend. (you know who you are) The great news is that they don't dare venture to the perfect dive bar. Where all the regulars are friendly (enough) and the drinks are plenty. With a great staff and even better HH deals, a pool table and nightly activities I just don't seem to be able stay away; especially on trivia wednesdays and the new $1 taco tuesday. All in all, when you and your friends start calling the local bar the "winchester" (shaun of the dead) you know you've found a great place.Thanks dub. I had the pleasure of going here with my best friend, Nate, as soon as I landed in Fremont. &#160;It was karaoke night, which was a tradition of ours since I lived in Portland. &#160;Even though the bar is Irish in name only, they carried some good beers(like Mac &amp; Jacks, a beer I had been craving for some time while on the east coast). &#160;It has a pretty fun environment and the prices are not too steep. &#160;I have a feeling this is definitely going to become one of my go-to neighborhood bars. Decent bar, decent crowd, decent music, decent beer selection, better than decent prices ($3 wells 3-8 most days), &#160;Many great nights in Fremont have started or ended at the Dubliner. Stopped by The Dubliner while waiting for a table at Kylie's. Happy Hour is always awesome here, and it's a good spot to stop by for a quick drink or to spend the night. Good times here! Had dinner at Chiso across the street while on a business trip to Seattle with my direct boss and the CEO of my company. &#160;Afterwards went across the street to the Dubliner for a drink. &#160;I was appointed as the guy to put the drinks on my corporate card. &#160;We had a very fun evening. &#160;Interesting crowd at the Dubliner and a good mix of hipsters, hippies, grungy types, and us. &#160;It was also Karaoke night. &#160;Drinks were reasonably priced and reasonably strong. &#160;At least from my San Francisco perspective. &#160;Anyway, an the end of the night we all stumble out of there and I forget my card. &#160;I realize this the next day, but we are already on the way to the airport and there is no way I can go back to Fremont to reclaim my card. &#160;After sufficient ribbing from the executive leadership, I called the Dubliner and they were kind enough to mail it back to me in SF! &#160;Good drinks, decent price, nice staff. &#160;Only qualm was one of the bartenders kept asking us to move from the spot where the green rubber mat is on the bar. &#160;This is the station where the cocktailer's pick up drinks. &#160;But the night we were there, I don't think any one was running drinks, so I don't really know why we kept getting asked to move.
We came in here on our own little private pub crawl last night after my wedding and weren't really impressed. The atmosphere was pretty uppity, and when the server heard that my husband and I had just gotten married, he said "Well why did you do that?" in what sound like a completely serious tone. Drink prices were pretty high. I had the champagne cosmo and it had a tough bite to it, but did have a good aftertaste. Cameron ordered a drink that was a shot of whiskey and a Rainer chaser; he said it was the worst whiskey he's ever had, but he was pleasantly surprised by Rainer, as he had never had it before.We stuck around for one drink and then skidaddled out of there. I might come back on a Friday or Saturday night to see if the atmosphere is better or not, but I probably won't seek it out. I like this place. Good drinks and a &#160;reall chillax sort of environment. It really feels like you are in someone's basement having drinks at their make-shift bar. &#160;The crowd was really nice and friendly bartenders. It also wasn't too crowded so no long waits for drinks and the bartenders deliver to your table. This is a true gem in the LQA. &#160;Try the Secretarat - very tasty. I walked in here for the first time and immediately was impressed with the space. Cute furniture and decent artwork on the walls and good music (seemed to be a mix of Lauren Hill and oldies). Nice. It was pretty empty. Me and my friend sit at the bar where we sit in front of the bartender, who is feverishly texting someone and can't be bothered to acknowledge our presence. We wait for her to notice the two new people sitting 3 feet in front of her. And we wait. Eventually we have to ask her for a drink menu and then we have to request a food menu. We settle on the mojito, swearengen, mac and cheese and the shephards pie. The drinks are nice and strong and the cocktail menu is interesting. The bartender spends the entire time directly in front of us facing the opposite wall texting. We seriously faced her butt and her back the entire time. The food comes, the mac n cheese with chorizo is pretty respectable, my shephards pie looked like a homemade tv dinner. It was colorless, tastless and runny. I had to request a spoon to eat it. Yuck. I was done with the food here so I decided to stick to the cocktails. By this time our wonderfully detached bartender had some friends drop in to visit. So now, with her back to us in another direction, we had to get her attention again so I could order a violette (it's a florally purple vodka drink). She mixed it fairly large and poured me mine in a martini glass and then swung over and dumped the remainder into a short glass for her friend across the bar. Now that's nice. I'm not gonna call total bitch on this one cuz apparently she does know how to treat her friends right..........but customers, not so much.
I used to love the pizza from their Fremont location and once gave that one 5 stars, but for some reason the pizza just didn't seem as good here. The building they and the South Lake Union Grill are in is too modern/stark and the restaurant just doesn't have much character. We got a salad + pizza for eating in and sat down. The tables were pretty dirty despite it not being that busy in there. They forgot our salad and we &#160;had to remind them about it after the pizza came.Seems like a place better suited for a quick slice to go or lunch. Also it looked like they had a pretty good happy hour special with 2 slices + a beer for like $6. Oh my god. Ignore every other review and pay attention to this next line: This is hands down the most amazing pizza on the West Coast. I'm an east coaster who is always looking for deliciousness, and I have found it at Mad. I've never seen so much garlic on a piece of pizza but it's roasted so not overwhelming. There was chicken and tomato and heaven in my mouth. I am a customer for life! Well, no mold here! &#160;I read some past reviews and feel bad for those that had a moldy pizza. &#160;I ordered one tonight. &#160;Friendly staff that was able to get my Prozac pizza out quickly for a to-go order. &#160;They gave me a free soft drink while I was waiting. &#160;My wife and I both liked the pizza and will return for another one soon. &#160;Thanks guys! &#160;This would be a 5 star, but the price of pizza is a little on the high side. I love Mad. &#160;I guess I just like their style of pie. &#160;It's just a basic circle of goodness. &#160;But the crust border can be a little dry. Another run of the mill, slightly doughy, imitation New York style pizza place. It reminds me of mall pizza. It's not bad though. And they have a decent happy hour option - 2 slices and a drink for $6 or something. Pretty good little pizza place. &#160;Not the best, definitely not the worst. &#160;Cool place with pizza by the slice. &#160;Their small (or half as they call them) salads are over-priced, but I did enjoy the spinach salad. &#160;Friendly service and ready to please. &#160;My slices were fresh out of the oven, so I'm sure my eating experience was enhanced by that alone. &#160;Typically at places where you can also order slices, the slices have been sitting out for a while. &#160;Almost NY style pizza... almost. &#160;I wasn't disappointed.
I actually liked the place. The spaghetti was pretty good, and the beer selection was respectable if not predictable.
Compared to some of the ramen places in the Bay Area, this is mediocre at best. A large crowd of us visited (filling nearly half the restaurant) and ordered the Tonkotsu, Shouyu, and the Tonkotsu-Shouyu bowls. The Tonkotsu and the Tonkotsu-Shouyu had a different type of noodle than the plain Shouyu; the noodles in the Shouyu were much better - a little thicker and sturdier. Many of the noodles in various bowls were still stuck together in large wads, as if they had been dumped into the pot and not stirred. (I watched one of the cooks open a large flat full of separate noodle compartments, apparently purchased wholesale, and drop them into the broth.)I got the Samurai Armor in mine, which was one of the upsides to the experience. It was a separate plate with extra pork, egg, and all the rest to add or omit at your preference. The broth, which should be the best part to a bowl of ramen, was bland and overly salty in the case of the Shouyu and just rather uninspired in the case of the Tonkotsu. If I were to visit again (which I'm not eager to do), I would order the Tonkotsu-Shouyu broth with the thicker noodles. Not being a fan of the kikurage (mushrooms), I was less than enthused about this addition, typically not present in Bay Area Ramen.I forgot to mention, one person got the Tampopo ramen, since it sounded good and the place made such a big deal of the movie (even advertising that they sell copies of the dvd!). I can't remember specifics, but the person who had the Tampopo didn't much care for it, and it was a person who typically enjoys good ramen. Compared to places I've been to in both the Bay and LA, Samurai Noodle falls squarely under the more mediocre and pricier ramen joints. It's one of those hole in the wall (seats about 15) ramen houses where you order the base and toppings separately. Go up to the counter, choose a soup base (which comes with some very basic garnishings), additional toppings as you see fit, and how you'd like your ramen cooked (soft, medium, or firm).I ordered the miso ramen with firm and extra noodles, and the samurai armor (a helping of extra chashu, an egg, green onions, bamboo shoots, kikurage, and roasted seaweed served on a side plate), for about $15 total. Assuming one orders the samurai armor, which I'd highly recommend since it's a good mix, I'd suggest passing on the extra noodles because it results in far too much food. If you'd like some to bring home though, the extra helping balances out the sheer amount of toppings and condiments you end up with. Overall, okay flavor and broth, not being horribly salty as long as you don't drink the soup, with good, but unusual chashu (about 3x thicker than traditional chashu, and reminded me of roasted BBQ pork, mostly in texture, but also slightly in flavor).Fills up easily (small surprise given the size), but turnaround is relatively quick. Prices are about a tad higher than I'd normally pay for ramen, and things like green tea being extra. That all said though, I'd probably come again if I'm desperately craving some ramen, authentic or not, but opting for medium instead of firm noodles, with the latter being too tough for my tastes. The good: Located right next to Uwajimaya, this place serves up ramen. &#160;But this is not the dry nasty flavorless ramen of your college years. &#160;It's full of flavor and you choose the type of broth and the meat. &#160;Get the Pork, its the most tender I've ever had. &#160;You will need to order extra meat because you only get one slice in the soup but you get 4-6 if you get a side of meat. &#160;Prices are decent but not cheap.The bad: My problem with this place is their service. &#160;They are always really curt and when my wife went to order and I took a seat, the waitress goes out of her way to come over and snap at me that there is no sitting until I've ordered. &#160;Granted there were a couple people in line, but there were three tables open and after I got up and moved all my stuff, we ended up sitting right back down in the same place once we'd ordered. &#160;After ordering, plan on waiting at least 20-30 minutes if there is even one other person in the restaurant. &#160;I always tip, ALWAYS, and I'm generous, but for the first time in my life, I left no tip and didn't feel bad at all for it. Everytime friends come to visit Seattle, this is one of the places I take them to. The pork they make is sooooo good! I've tried a variety of ramen from their menu, and I've never been disappointed. My personal favorite is the Samuri Armor Bowl. Even though this is in the International District, parking isn't a problem because they validate tickets if you park in Uwajimaya's lot. The place is pretty small, so expect to have to wait! Also, it can be a bit pricey for ramen, but oh well, it's still good. tonkatsu= fried pork cutlettonkotsu= broth that has been simmering with pork bones that results in a milky color and textureok, now that that's out of the way.samurai is "a-ok". &#160;not WOW material, but a decent bowl of noodles.i wish the broth came scalding hot, but the last time i requested it HOT, i was told that their broth always comes out hot... sigh. not to this tongue.tonkotsu broth is pretty good. smooth and not too salty.the green onion chilli ramen looks scary spicy but it's not.mentaiko rice bowl is pretty flavorful given it's just mentaiko and seaweed.i visit occasionally when in the area and don't feel like pho. Samurai Noodle on University Ave? &#160;Could it be true? &#160;Yes! Yes! &#160;Yes! &#160;I drove by and saw a sign posted that my beloved ramen shop is opening up a new location at the U. &#160;I called Samurai Noodle and they confirmed that YES! &#160;They are working on the final permits and hope to open in late February/ early March 2010. &#160;Now I'm just a hop, skip and a jump away from my favorite bowel of ramen! &#160;Hopefully the new restaurant will be a bit bigger but regardless, I know it'll be one of my regular haunts. &#160;I usually like to order the Tonkatsu, the broth is not as milky and rich as Ippudo NY but decent for Seattle. &#160; Last time I went with hubs and we both ordered Chili Green Onion ramen and split a Samurai Armour. &#160;Wowza, talk about onion breath!TIP: I highly suggest splitting an armour cause it's too much for one person. &#160;If you are hungry, order the Spicy Green Onion Tofu, a nice refreshing appetizer or go for a 2nd helping of noodles. Damn good ramen. We've been looking for a good ramen place and this one is a solid entry.Very cramped and steamy, but tastiness abounds. I think the broth was almost too rich, if one can imagine such a thing. I tried the extra pork fat one and nearly passed out on the floor. Wifey had normal one and it was still very rich.I'd like to go back and try some more. The ramen is tasty - you can tell it isn't uber-processed or made of weird ingredients. &#160;I enjoyed the dish and would eat here again happily.The prices were high though, they must have insane margin on this. &#160;$6.75 for the small, almost noodle only dish. &#160;$8.00 for most dishes. &#160;$3.50 for most sides or extras for the ramen, plus drinks. &#160;Than Bros pho is a different product, but a much better value of similar quality. &#160;The service was just ok. &#160;They were busy, and they are brand new, so I want to give them some leeway while they figure things out and get in the groove. &#160;The restaurant is clean, and the furnishings are nice. &#160;I really like how clean the place is.If it was $1 less on most items, I would be a lot more excited to come here. So, it was one cold evening on Seattle and I met my friend for some dinner at this small but cozy little place around the corner of the Uwajimaya. &#160;My friend recommended the pork broth noodles. &#160;I ordered extra pork and garlic with it. &#160;Did it hit the spot! &#160;I imagined being a native of Japan having my Grandmother cook this for me to cure all ailes. The place is small and you can customize your soup quite well. &#160;L:ike I said, "excellent" for those cold and rainy nights... Hot rameny damn! &#160;This place is amazingly delicious. &#160;Absolutely not noticeable but a true ramen gem. &#160;I've had the immense pleasure of enjoying a bowl of tonkotsu and it was SO good I can't really find words to describe it. &#160;The broth is extremely flavorful. &#160;Like POW, I'm some bad ass broth! &#160;Seriously, if you like ramen, you must check this place out. &#160;It's small so don't bring your 10 closest friends, just the ramen fanatics in your life. &#160;My friend had the hot ramen that basically had red broth and he liked it. &#160;It looked intense. &#160;I went with a friend from Japan and she thought it was pretty legit too so I'm impressed. &#160;Even though the place is run by some nerd white kids, they know their shit. To be honest, I am not a fan of the "restaurants" that are in the food court at Uwajimaya. So when I heard this place was attached to the Asian market, I was turned off at first. But then I was around the corner and ramen sounded good. The place didn't disappoint. Only a few tables so it's better as a take out than a sit down. Prices are good. If you like ramnen, give this place a go. Lots of options on the menu even for extra toppings, though I typically get the basic Tonkatsu (pork broth). Now THIS is what I'm talking about. My first foray into the Seattle ramen noodle scene was at the Boom Noodle Bistro, which was a mistake. (Seriously- who tries to make ramen into a high end foodie adventure? That is not in the true nature of ramen)Samurai Noodle is much more authentic. I knocked off half a star because the space was so cramped and the ventilation in the room was really bad, so all the kitchen aromas infiltrated the dining room and made my very sensitive red headed boyfriend sick to his stomach. He felt better once the food got to our table, though. The bowls are decently sized and come with a boatload of toppings, which is unusual for any ramen joint. Usually you just get a smattering of corn, scallions, and two pieces of meat. Not so here. The noodles were also just the right amount of chewy (I ordered the medium), and the scallions and corn looked fresh. I knocked off another half star for the slowness of the meal: when you eat ramen, you're looking for a simple, filling, fast-food meal. The speed of the service here was a tad slow for that. At your table there's also a little shelf just above eye level with all the seasonings you need for a perfect bowl of ramen.I will definitely come back for my next ramen fix, but I'm still on the search for the true ramen experience. I'm not a ramen expert, but I throughly enjoy the ramen here, especially the chili-green onion one. &#160;Armor that up (extra pork, bamboo, nori, and hardboiled egg), and you've got the recipe for a coma-inducing bowl of ramen.This almost makes it worth the slow, and often rude, service that I've consistently experienced at this location. Sometimes I feel that there are as many people in the kitchen as there are in the dining area. And I STILL have to wait 20+ minutes to get my food. Because I'm waiting so long after ordering anyway, their "order first, sit later" model doesn't make any sense to me. Last time I was there, I had two out-of-town guests with me who had large backpacks, and they wouldn't let us set them down until we ordered, even though nobody was ahead of us to get a table and we were obviously going to order. Bah. Overall, good food. Poor service. I've been on a mission and that mission was to find a ramen noodle house and did I ever find one!This place was TINY! I think it only holds like a maximum of like 15 people. I could see how there could be a long waiting line. Lucky I was early and got there before the crowd. I was overwhelmed and confused while looking over the menu. Lucky the nice waitress helped me out. I decided to get the Samurai Armor Bowl with the chicken broth. You also get to decide if you want your noodles soft, medium or hard (That's what she said!). I picked the medium. The noodles came out quick. I got a tray with two bowls. One was the broth and noodles. The broth was lip-smacking good as the chicken flavors burst on to my taste buds (not salty). The noodle texture, flavor and firmness were also amazing. The other was a bowl consisting of the following:thickly sliced pork -the meat was so tender and salty which went great with the broth and noodlesa hardboiled egg - it was cooked in the same marinate that the pork was (I love eggs)Bamboo shoots - It was thinly sliced and I ate them all Seaweed - Rectangular cut piece added extra flavors to the brothDiced green onion - help give it some bright coloring and a slight onion flavorThe service was fast, efficient and they even valid your parking! I was so full after eating the noodles with all the fixings too! I'm living under the impression that this is the best ramen in Seattle. &#160;If that's not the case, please tell me, so I can go there and be in heaven.I haven't had ramen in Portland, but among the major eating cities on the west coast, this place is in my top 6 or 8 ramen shops.. &#160;(Hard to keep be accurate, since places come &amp; go, and quality changes.) &#160;But, they do things right here. &#160;Very tasty soup - in my penultimate trip here, I got the tsuke men. &#160;The sweet broth for the sweet tsuke men was reminiscent of my first visit to Tai Sho Ken in Ikebukuro. &#160;That has never been topped, but just to be reminded of that experience puts this place up to 5 stars for me.Note: I'm not sure what it is, but when you get it to go (which I've only done with ramen once), it loses it soul. &#160;They give it to you al dente, which I don't particularly like, but it's understandable. &#160;But, if you bring it over to the uwajimaya food court, it's quick enough not to get soggy. &#160;But, I think that ramen just isn't supposed to be made "to go". My college kid visiting from school took us to Samuri for dinner. And I am so happy he did! We loved it. It is a pretty authentic noodle house that serves excellent noodle soup. We all ordered the same thing...the combination broth with the extra goodies, noodles prepared "medium" (not soft or hard ..."good choice" according to the dude taking the order). Scrumptious. Make sure to get the extra stuff...seaweed, mushrooms, a hard boiled egg and your choice of meat.. The bottom line is that we will be back! Small, quaint and great broth. You can tell they make a bowl of noodles here with lots of love. It hit the spot on this rainy day. I've only ever had the ramen with pork broth (tonkotsu), but that dish has made me a hardcore fan of Samurai Noodle. It isn't reassuring to see the broth congeal after 5 minutes of cooling off, but it's just so tasty. Get the &#160;ramen with extra pork! The broth is rich and thick - the closest to the real deal in Japan... i agree with Johnny W... this place is just ok. &#160;I've must prefer the bay area and LA ramen shops than this one... i got the tonkotsu with ultra rich pork flavor... and i was disappointed... i guess i really was expecting something super tasty... i thought the soup lacked the true tonkotsu flavor... noodles aren't great... better if they were home made i suppose... eh... just made me miss LA ramen THAT much more... kinda feel bad that this is suppose to be the most authentic ramen shop here... =( Samurai on the Ave is now open so I have to make good on my promise and update my review. Yay for tasty noodle goodness! Perfection on a rainy day is looking into a deep endless noodle bowl at Samurai.. So satisfying! Great, authentic ramen house located just outside of the entrance to Uwajimaya. &#160;I love their tonkatsu (sp?) broth ramen. &#160;Seating is a little tricky because the place is so small, and the chairs have no backs (which is probably a good thing to keep the traffic moving on through), but somehow they make it work. &#160;I really advise using the spicy sauce they have near the tables. &#160;And, if you're really hungry just add "samurai armor" to your meal to get additional ingredients!
Best Chinese I've had in this city so far, and I don't know if it gets better than this.My girlfriend recommended this place to me after I was nursing one of the worst hangovers ever. &#160;One of my remedies for getting nourishment is hot &amp; sour soup. &#160;So she went and got me this soup which was more than just some chives and stock. It had actual vegetables and eggs in it and it had the right amount of kick to get me up and running.When I was better the next day, she left me some of what she had, which was sweet and sour chicken and what looked to be katsu chicken (but it wasn't...have to go see what they call it), and they had this really yummy sweet &amp; sour sauce that was not like most (it was darker like teriyaki but it had the same consistency as s&amp;s). &#160;The chicken chow main and fried rice (it was half &amp; half) was also pretty good too. &#160;Lots of good stuff like cashews and stuff. &#160;It was really favorful and filling.I'm going to have to submit a full-on review at a later date when I can actually go in there and enjoy a meal when I am 100%. &#160;Who knew in Ballard of all places? My first in ballard to find decent Chinese meal away from the hum drum of downtown. &#160;To expect Chinese food from Ballard a First as well. &#160;Atmosphere is very upscale for a chinese restaurant. &#160;Family get togethers and parties was about and i can understand why. &#160;The food was delicious. &#160;The service was fast and friendly. &#160;I dont know if it was Louie who was seating the entire patrons but a few laughs from his quirky jokes were appealing. &#160;Yay I am a fan from Louie's Cuisine. &#160;Their tenderloin steaks were indead tender which it should be. &#160;A little less salt please next go around please. &#160;The sauce on the meat is a little saulty for my taste but otherwise the vegetables with seafood which was fresh and green made the meat tastier.I enjoyed the picturesque view of the chinese decor and art. &#160;Maybe it was just lunch but everything on the menu was like under $12 hmmmm &#160;i wonder if this would be a great place for those who are meeting their dates for the first time and just want a place to relax and get to know one another without spending a bundle on their introduction. &#160;I may improve the restaurant with another one star over time, but unsure if i will be in the area again but if so i will definitely stop on in. &#160;Enjoy yourself here. &#160;I may stop in the bar area next time and see how the atmosphere is as well. &#160;Keep up the friendly service and the excellent food. &#160;You definitely have the decor and parking &#160;and cleanliness at par so I am sure you will attract more patrons or continued patronage. I would never recognize this restaurant from the reviews I've read here. &#160;The service I've received has been consistently swift, unfussy, and efficient. &#160;The food conforms to a uniform, unvarying standard; tasty "American-Chinese" in reasonable portion sizes, served hot. &#160;The furnishings are quiet, clean, and understated. &#160;There is nothing hip, nothing trendy, nothing faddish. &#160;The lighting is low and the ambiance harkens back to the 60s when maybe dad would take mom to the yacht club, to give her a break from the kitchen, or maybe they'd go here. That anyone would fault this hallowed institution by saying the fortunes in the cookies are lame is simply absurd. &#160;The great virtue of the negative reviews is that snotty people looking for something to sneer about will have been steered clear of this fine, old, staid restaurant.
If you like hanging out in a small dark basement this is your place. The Alibi Room should stick to the upstairs where they serve pizza and drinks. The "room" downstairs is standing room only, its hot and dj gameboy is horrible. Dont go here if you want a night out with dancing. Cool little hole-in-the wall bar. &#160;Good staff. &#160;Very good pizza. &#160;Interesting people. &#160;Hidden location. &#160;Prices are reasonable. Wow, this place is tucked away, isn't it? &#160;If my friends hadn't been there before, I'm sure I'd have passed it up a few times. &#160;Granted, that might be because I was too busy staring at the crazy gum wall to notice the sign, but still. &#160;Darn my heels &amp; the stone street to get there, though. &#160;Won't be repeating that mistake!I wasn't sure what to expect here, but my friends said I'd enjoy it. &#160;Oh, they know me too well, indeed. &#160;And I'm with Rachel H. - great drinks &amp; the fresca is outstanding! &#160;I could have had several of them &amp; probably not noticed the alcohol... Well, until I tried to stand up &amp; fell flat on my face because of the amount of booze they contained. &#160;Still yummy, though. &#160;I was also partial to the desserts since they serve some of the best key lime pie that has ever passed between my lips. &#160;It's thick, rich, creamy, &amp; just tart enough to make me pucker a little. &#160;Oh, and the crust wasn't all crumbly &amp; dry. &#160;It held the pie together just so &amp; offered a nice texture contrast to the rest of it. &#160;I also got a taste of their tiramisu, which was lovely, too. &#160;I'm not usually big on coffee-soaked desserts, but the cake was extremely moist and the coffee wasn't over powering.I really liked the layout &amp; ambiance, too. &#160;There was space at the bar, but we opted for a table in a dark corner. &#160;They have some cool art on the walls, too &amp; I loved that it never got overly loud while we were there, despite the late hour. &#160;Our waitress was friendly &amp; quick, but didn't bother us much once we were settled. &#160;That added to the laid-back vibe going around, which we appreciated. &#160;Without question, this is a repeat for me whenever I'm back in town. Five of us tucked into the Alibi Room around 8 pm on a Saturday to get some drinks and small bites. &#160;The atmosphere upstairs dining area is dark and comfortable and caters to everything! &#160;Downstairs is a bit smaller and little more swanky with a DJ spinning the beats and great cocktails being mixed.You must try the wedge salad and the roasted garlic and cambozola w/ foccacia bread. &#160; This place is a little hidden but a MUST find if you are near the Pike Place Market or just want to head down for some great food and cocktails. Happy hour from 3-6 during the week and 12-6 on the weekends!What's YOUR Alibi? in about 9pm on a saturday night, after finishing the "ghost tour" through pike place. our server - which now that i'm writing this i wish i knew her name!!! - was outstanding; double thumbs up for her - she routinely refilled our water glasses (we were parched coming in from a hot day) and was appropriately attentive, which was most impressive mainly because we had coupons for 2 free appetizers so really only paid for 1 beverage! the 2 appies: spicy mac and cheese, which was good - just the right amount of kick to it (probably 2 1/2 of 4 stars on the spice scale?) and a reasonably sized portion for an appie. the 2nd choice was the hummus which had a smooth, creamy texture but was disappointingly bland. it came with cucumber and tomato slices (fresh and tasty) and pita triangles. the later it became the louder it got - and busier, of course, too. difficult to carry on a conversation without yelling across the table at my dining companion, which is not my preference. if it wasn't so loud i suppose it could be romantic? but the dim lights, post-alley location, and even its association with a possible ghost in the basement (??) make this a pretty cool spot. BEST PIZZA IN SEATTLE! &#160;Fresh market ingredients + special pizza oven make for an amazing treat! My experience at the Alibi Room this past Thursday night left me wondering one thing: Why do I not come here more often?! A friend and I met in the upstairs part of the restaurant/bar at around 8:30 pm and we received excellent service from matching blonde servers clad in black dresses. The Alibi Room offers a very nice selection of reasonably-priced wines by the glass, plus of course a full bar for those in the mood for cocktails. Diverse drink offerings seemed to attract a diverse crowd, as the clientele included eclectic 30-somethings and even a group of Teamsters out for an evening brew.I have to confess, I am not exactly a fan of pizza with tomato sauce (I know, I know... Boo! Hiss!) and I was THRILLED to see that Alibi Room's pizza offerings include a full list of traditional pies plus a whole other long list of non-tomato-sauce varieties. The revelation was as if the oven doors to Heaven had opened and a choir of artichoke angels began to sing. It was difficult to decide what to pick, but ultimately I went with a creation involving roasted red grapes, blue cheese, arugula, and a balsamic creation. Just excellent. In addition to loving the sans sauce line-up, I'm also a fan of Alibi Room's pizza crust...thin without being cracker-like, able to support toppings without being doughy.My only diss on Alibi Room is that with the doors to Post Alley open, the smell of cigarette smoke (from people who don't mind smoking while staring at a big wall o' chewed-up gum, apparently) wafts into the restaurant with abandon. I suppose I'm spoiled following Washington's no-smoking ban, but I wouldn't hate it if someone shooed away the puffers. Love Alibi Room! &#160;bartenders and servers are fabulous! &#160;Went there for &#160;birthday celebration and had a great time. &#160;Drinks were well concocted, and appetizers were delicious. This review is for the food. &#160;Their pizzas are so mouthwatering! We had the sausage and pepperoni and they did not skimp on their toppings. &#160;I'm fan of thin crust pizza so I really enjoyed it. &#160;I also tried their macaroni and cheese, which was pretty spicy to the point I can feel it on the back of my throat. &#160;I personally liked it but my friend hates spicy food so he let me eat the rest of it. &#160;So if you are not a fan of spicy, either skip this dish or ask if they can lower the heat.The service here was not up to par. &#160;My friend and I were waiting for our waiter for almost 10 min and I just went up to the bar and placed our order. &#160;You see, my friend had to catch the last ferry back to Bremerton by 12:15 ish, and it was pretty late since we got out of seeing chromeo at the showbox. &#160;Our waiter never came back to refill our glasses or even to give us our check. &#160;I ended up going up to him again to pay it so my friend could go home.Ok so maybe 3 stars might sound harsh for this review...so I'd say this is a 3.5 star rating. &#160;But I wouldn't tell friends to not go here because I really do love hanging out here. Whoa, there's a whole other room downstairs! And it's private and has its own bar! Why did no one tell me this?The Alibi Room was generous enough to host and cater a party for the Seattle Symphony's Wolfgang group this last weekend, and they really went above and beyond. The spread was spectacular - pizzas, veggies and hummus, different breads and desserts - and the bartender working the bar was really friendly and chatty. The room was the perfect size for our group of 30 or so people, but could have benefited from a few well-placed chairs to supplement the big booths.The next time anyone needs a private room for a party I will definitely direct them to the Alibi room but I'll be sure to let them know to stay on the lookout for the naked old man that likes to walk in front of the window directly across. Creepy... Wow- I didn't know a place like this existed in Seattle. &#160;Fun bar, nice design, friendly service, and really yummy appetizers. &#160;It's set in a cool location in Post Alley right across from the gum wall. &#160;It seems popular and for a good reason so the only thing I'd say is be prepared to wait on a weekend night. &#160;They even have a pizza oven and the menu choices looked promising so I will definitely be back to try that. Located down in an old alley in the market is one of Seattle's brightest gems. What did I find here? Red grape, blue cheese, and arugula pizza that tasted like heaven...set to candle light and 80's new wave. Not to mention the friendliest service I have ever encountered in Seattle..."it was sorta like a dream, no..better!" I have been to the Alibi Room a few times and have consistently had an enjoyable time so I figured it best to contribute to the positive reviews. &#160;I must admit my biased for a perfectly dim lit room. &#160;I do not care for being in places that have all the lights off, nor to I care for strobe lights or bright lights. &#160;I think lighting is an art and Alibi does a very nice job of creating an intimate space with enough light to see around you. &#160;It is has always been clean and the clientele seem pleasant every time I visit. &#160;The bartenders have always been friendly and notice me almost as soon as I come up to the bar. &#160;The only reason I did not give a full 5 star rating was based on my personal preference for the music and should not necessarily deter anyone from checking this place out. &#160;The downstairs DJ on my visits has played a variety of music but a little too much 90's hip hop for my dancing shoes. &#160;There were lots of people dancing which I thought was great as well.All in all, I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fun night out. &#160;I know I will definitely be returning. Went here after the pike place ghost tour. the place is absolutely haunted. a glass flew out of the waiter's hand and shattered on the ground(possibly clumsiness but he says it happens all the time...) The hostess also told me that the faucets are running when she comes in in the moring.A nice candlelit dinner ensued. I ordered a martini and iceburg salad. My date ordered some bacon pizza - it was only ok. But we did have a cambozola appetizer which was amazing. good martinis, good food, spookiness Great happy hour. &#160;Love the brew and apples on focaccia bread Finding this place was like a treasure hunt (when you see the giant wall of gum, turn around and there you are), and then trying to read the menu while our eyes adjusted to the darkness inside was another adventure. It took two margaritas for me to recover!The spicy mac-and-cheese was really delish. I'd definitely go back next time I'm in Seattle just for that. I would have never known this place existed until my friend showed me. It's hidden from the main streets. My friends and I came here right after work. We had a friendly server. &#160;I ordered a drink and bruschetta. It was a dark atmosphere....almost made me feel sleepy. My friend took me downstairs into the basement and showed me the dance floor area. It was early enough that it was empty. It's always nice to check out Seattle's old buildings. It had a quiet vibe. A lounge vibe. So don't bring your rowdy loud friends here straight after work. &#160;Take them to The Pike instead. &#160;I probably won't be back but it was a fun experience. I have been here 3 times now. The food is really good. The service is HORRIBLE. &#160;They have a good happy hour... not great. The pizzas and cheese plate are good.The noise is bad because it is such a small area. The paintings on wall were different every time... that was cool.Biggest downfall is that the staff all sit and talk while ignoring the patrons... ALL THREE TIMES I WAS THERE. Wow. Even after living in Seattle for 7 years now, I never knew this place (or any place below Pike's) existed and I've been missing out! &#160;I came here for drinks with a girlfriend and we were seated right away. &#160;The upstairs is fairly small, but tables can be pushed together for large parties. &#160;We were seated next to this large group of bachelorette-party ladies who were very entertaining. :) &#160;They have a full bar, great beers on draft and HH specials. &#160;I had already eaten dinner, but I could smell the fresh baked pizzas all around and it smelled delicious! &#160;They have a LOT of pizza options and they only use fresh ingredients from the Market, which I liked seeing. &#160;Definitely ordering a pizza next time!What's kind of funny about this place is that after a certain time the downstairs opens up as a "dance floor". &#160;My friend and I checked it out briefly and surprisingly it was packed. &#160;Semi-older crowd with a lot of couples. &#160;Overall, this place has a fun atmosphere, has a unique location (right next to the gum wall in Seattle) and has a lot of options for everyone! Ok so I will be the first to admit I am not well educated in the bar scene AT ALL. I am a married mom to 5 so yea my bar experiences are few and far between. But the sis and I wanted to get together before her trip to India so we came here. I liked it! We went in the middle of the day during happy hour so cheap appetizers. We got the mini pizza (plain cheese...yum) and the bruschetta with a bulb of garlic and some yummy cheese (can't remember the name of it). But the server got it to us super fast and it was sooo yummy. We ordered vodka cranberries, also just dandy and the server was friendly, joked around with us a bit, wasn't a bugaboo, and I got some awesome quality time with my little sister so it was a win-win all around and I would definitely come again! A recap of the our experience before and after Alibi Room...We stumbled upon the entrance to Post Alley on our way back to the hotel and we see the gum wall. &#160;A friend and I decide we're going to be cool and take ridiculous photos near the gum wall. &#160;We go into Alibi Room after we're done taking photos, go downstairs to see what is going on, G tries to close her umbrella by pressing it against a water glass (not sure this is exactly what she did), knocks the glass off the table, the glass breaks, the music stops, and someone in the distance says, "uh-oh!" &#160;We look at each other and run upstairs, insist on drinking a few more beers at the bar, then go home. &#160;We arrive back at the hotel and as G walks in, she slips on the hardwood floors and lands face down on the ground laughing. &#160;Words cannot describe how awesome this night was. I was lucky enough to try this place last week when a couple of my BFFs were visiting. I am SO GLAD that I did! We went on a Friday night and we had no lofty ideas that we would be seated right away or anything. They took our name and number and we walked around the market for awhile, which is pretty charming at night even though its closed. We were seated about an hour later and what really stood out to me about this place was the front of the house (who turned out to be the owner!), Corry. I am such a fan of his. Just great customer service all the way around and I knew I would be returning instantly.If your in the mood for drinking go for the Gin Fizz and the Fresca, they will not disappoint. The prices are so reasonable here that I almost felt like I was being punked or had suddenly lost the ability to read correctly. One of their pizzas will easily feed two, and they are SO GOOD.If my life were a sitcom this would totally be my nightly hang out. I heart you Alibi Room ( + Corry of course) I've been to Alibi Room every single time I've visted Seattle, sometimes even on multiple occasions. &#160;Its great during the day to get a late lunch or early dinner. &#160;The food is so great, and even while enjoying whatever it is that I ordered, I always catch delicious smells coming from other tables, and I end up wishing I could try their food too.The drinks are delicious, the ambiance is absolutely perfect. &#160;I love the ever-changing art on the walls, and the music is always some from my favorite bands (the first time I ever went, they played Interpol's "Turn on the Bright Lights" album in its entirety. &#160;Instant love.)Downstairs is ridiculous. &#160;In a good way. &#160;I love the fact that upstairs its a cool, chilled out bar-slash-pizza place, and downstairs its a bumping, mini-club. &#160;Whether you want to hang out and have a drink and talk, or hang out and have ten drinks and dance, its all in one place. &#160;Seriously worth checking out.Plus its easy to find... directly facing the gum wall. I have been to Alibi several times over the years. &#160;With girlfriends, drinks before a concert with a guy friend of mine, HH with my mother and for post dinner drinks with a date. &#160;It is one of those places, hidden away, which has a certain speakeasy feel to it with its dark interior and off the beaten path location. &#160;It can get loud at times depending on the time of night but there is always a good crowd of people. &#160;I have seen birthday celebrations, dates, groups of friends, after Mariner game patrons, and everything in between which is what I like about it. &#160;The HH food is well priced and quite tasty and the drinks are delicious. &#160;On my most recent visit I had the 206 martini with vodka and St. Germain and it was absolutely delicious with a bit of sweetness but balance with the vodka. &#160;These could be very dangerous! &#160;I think this is a great spot to start your night with HH or also a great way to end the night after a meal in one of the many nearby restaurants (Steelhead Diner, Matt's in the Market, Caf&#233; Campagne and Chez Shea just to name a few).*if you want to get your groove on they had a DJ downstairs on Friday night so you could have a chill low key time upstairs and then pop down for some dancing as you feel the need! The drinks here are amazing. &#160;I especially liked the "hey how bout a fresca hmmmm" (I'm preety sure that's exactly what its called).The downstairs got a little bumpin for me, but I'm kind of an old lady in that respect. Was told that this was the place to go. &#160;Except for the dance floor being smaller than I expected it was a fun place. &#160;Awesome atmosphere. &#160;Didn't really get drinks here, just came to dance with some friends. The first thing that I observed after I opened the main door is the smell. I'm not sure if it's a "cheesy" smell or chlorine (like a cleanser or something). It was a turn-off at first but after few minutes, I was immuned to it.One other complaint is the noise. The room is so concentrated and it gets really loud. 2 ladies beside us are kind a tipsy and they laugh like HAHAHAHAHA!!!!! Our table is also very small but that was fine.If you heard that this is a tourist trap, ignore it and I'm sure you'll have a great time. I won't bring my parents here though, it's too LOUD. If you are a tourist with parents and kids, venture somewhere else (I'm not pointing this in a negative way).Service is great and very good pizza. The drink I ordered (I forgot the name but I think it says like Seattle favorite or something) is also very refreshing.I'm making this 5 stars because I really like the interior. It reminds me of family owned tapa bars. We also had a great time. Another great place to hang out with the gang So they have a bunch of 'screen plays' in the front right by the door. My friend and I ordered beers and read the first act of 'Sense and Sensibility', written by Emma Thompson. Awesome. The Alibi Room is fantastic! I found it though other people on yelp. It is across from the famous Gum Wall at Pike's Place and like someone else has said, you do feel like you are part of a secret society, almost. I love the feel of the place, it is very small and dark but very relaxed. The happy hour menu is great and their pizza is delicious. I would highly, highly recommend this great little gem in Seattle. After dinner with a few friends, we wandered over to Post Alley and had a chance to enjoy the Alibi Room for a short while. &#160;Overall it was a pretty good scene. For a Friday night in Belltown, it wasn't overwhelmingly crowded or loud, and the crowd was chill. &#160;The place is dark and spartan, but that's just part of the ambiance...sort of a mix of "industrial" and "old world." &#160;The bartender was very friendly (although my Bombay martini was a bit on the strong/harsh side), and overall I would recommend the Alibi Room for anyone looking for a exciting place to socialize with friends without drama. Stopped in here after work one day with a friend for Happy hour. The personal pizza was awesome, and the beers were nicely chilled. The place was pretty much empty, which made service pretty snappy. When we were done I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I can say this cab is rare but I thought 'Nah forget it' - 'Yo homes to Bel Air'...I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I yelled to the cabbie 'yo homes smell ya later' I looked at my kingdom I was finally there to sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air! Last stop of a short pub crawl at midnight. Awesome location. Some interesting ppl hangin outside the bar. It was not too crowded for a Sunday night with Monday holiday. Didn't see the basement as the bar there was closed. But seems like a cool place to be on a weekend night. Will go again. the happy hour prices are not bad. &#160;along with my beer, i had the pepperoni pizza, which tasted pretty good and was a good personal-sized serving.my rating is lower than average because the place needed more waitstaff. &#160;the servers took a long time to come to our table, even when there barely any customers at the time.also, what's with the restrooms being down a steep set of dimly lit stairs? &#160;that could be bad news for people who've had a few. &#160;and when you get there, the signs on the restroom doors were hard to figure out. &#160;even when fully sober, there's a 50-50 chance that you'd pick the wrong door and freak out someone of the opposite sex on the other side. &#160;... i wonder if that's how the bar got the 'alibi' in its name ... I like Alibi Room just for the ambiance. It makes you feel like a member of a secret society, sneaking down a sketchy alley and ducking into a barely visible door. It's dim and cozy, and has brick walls covered with rotating art for sale, perfect for meeting a friend or two. They have a decent happy hour, perfect for noshing with an after work beer or cocktail. The brie plate is probably the best, with plenty of cheese, sweet apples, and foccia, but the mini pizzas (great thin crust) and mac n' cheese are also decent. A fun little place for after work. I spent a fair amount of time investigating reasonably priced places in downtown Seattle where the food was good as was the "pre-going out" atmosphere for a Saturday night as the last time I was in town my boyfriend and I must have walked ten blocks looking for a place where the entrees weren't $20+ and settled for a cheesy seedy seafood place that was near empty on a Saturday night.I found the Alibi Room on yelp, the menu appealed to me and the cost was about right. &#160;The pictures on the website looked inviting and it was near Showbox at the Market where we were headed.We had dungeoness crab dip and I think caprese pizza. &#160;The pizza was FANTASTIC - no skimping on the meat. &#160;The crab dip was kind of fishy to me but my boyfriend really liked it. &#160;I did find that for the States that the wine by the glass was pretty expensive; in Canada we pay $7-9 for a low-end house wine and it was the same there. &#160;I could be wrong but in my experience in the States it's usually around 5.50-6.00. &#160;The atmosphere was warm, inviting and trendy enough without being pretentious; the host had an excellent beard/moustache combo and he was a friendly face to welcome us at the door. &#160;The location is nice too for us tourists; in Post Alley I think which is right downtown.All and all I really enjoyed it, the prices were reasonable, food was great and I will definitely be back again the next time I'm in town! Hole in the wall found right across from the gum wall! Was a Sunday night in Seattle and me and my two friends decided to take a night stroll for drinks..I'll have to admit, it was off the beaten path. But hang a right after the gum wall and its like the secret garden/ dive bar.This place was a little sketchy at first. Dim lighting and a sighting if a man in a bright pink gorilla suit, seriously. Reminded me of a cabin or being under deck on a ship... Haha don't ask me where i get these analogies.. But it's definitely a local dive bar where ppl come for some late night drinks n food. We were still full from eating all day, so just drinks were on the agenda.I only had a cucumber/mint drink. Not great. I expected a lot more flavor. Maybe they didn't marinate the cucumbers long enough?! Who knows. I seemed to babysit my drink due to the fact that it was &#160;mediocre. A table next to us ordered some pizza and it looked mighty tasty, if only our bellys weren't about to burst at the seams we would have ordered some.Anywho, our local friend said the second floor was more of a "club" setting on the better nights. Weren't witness to that unfortunately. Overall, OK.. next time in Seattle on a sunday night and looking for some drinks (and a place to stay warm) I'll &#160;stop by here... Very fun place right across from the gum wall in the alley before Pike Place Market. &#160;Literally a hole in the wall!! &#160;I have passed by it often without ever realizing it was there.Good drinks, nice ambience, good pizza and a nice place to go after a concert at The Showbox (Last night it happened to be The Psychedelic Furs!)A little dark and gives you the feel of kinda like you're in a secret bar. &#160;Cool place! Love the drinks. Love the selection of gin. Love the bartender. Adore the pizza. Great place. Especially enjoyed the gum wall outside. And the strange, precipitous drop outside the windows. Come in at ground level, look out the window over a 2 story drop. Cool. Happy Hour? Check. Good music? Check. Fabulous waitress? Check check!I take everyone here when they visit Seattle. I mean everyone. Boyfriend, parents, little sister, snooty friend, snazzy friend, etc. And they all loved it. The first time I went, the waitress sat a friend and I right away, and advised us to choose within the next ten minutes so we'd get the happy hour prices. How rad is that! The place reminds me of some of my favorite spots in Europe. It's dark and not pretentious at all. Just relaxed, with incredible brie, pizza, and bruchetta. The brie and honey plate is my favorite!It's not only the food that makes this place ideal, or the location (across from the gum wall in Pike's Place), but the whole ambiance. Heavy wooden tables, candles, great bar, large windows on one wall only. Pick a stormy afternoon and settle in for some great appetizers and pear cider. Yum! It's my go-to spot. Liked the Alibi Room a lot. Very decent food and really good drinks. Try the Fresca--mmmmmm..... I've eaten here twice - both times, the food was superb and the experience was really cool. This place is a hidden gem near the "Public Market" area, near the awesome (and kinda gross) chewing gum wall!The dining area is very dark &amp; is a very relaxed atmosphere. &#160;I recommend the pizzas! It's a little pricey if you're eating &amp; drinking, but well worth the money! If you love pizza and awkward white kids dancing the way that hipsters love scarves, then this place is perfect for you. Came here two nights in a row with friends while I was visiting from San Francisco. The first night we rolled in at 11:30 and headed downstairs for drinks. Old school hip hop? Check. People dancing like it was their job? Double check. A bartender who laughed at my joke? Need I say more? On our way out, we caught the sight and smell of pizzas and I made a mental note to try the food before I left Seattle. The next night, we beelined it to this place. We had a reservation for 7:30 and arrived right on time, but our table wasn't ready yet. The consolation prize? A free plate of pita, hummus, olives, feta and cucumbers. And we didn't even mind waiting! Dinner was amazing: the mushroom pizza with truffle oil and the prosciutto pizza are worthy of a five-star review. Drinks were strong, waitress was nice and the soundtrack to the place made my day (Black Keys, Killers...). Headed downstairs to finish out the night and memories were made. To quote 2010: this place is epic. The food was delicious, the service simply adequate, and the "night club" scene was...not really there. &#160;We had planned to have dinner and then stay for dancing. &#160;Dinner was delicious; we had the focaccia &amp; cambonzola to start (the focaccia is toasty and flavorful, and the roasted garlic melts on your tongue; the tomato, basil and cheese also pair well), and then split a spicy mac &amp; cheese and a goat cheese, prosciutto, &amp; arugula pizza. &#160;The mac &amp; cheese definitely had a kick, which I really appreciated, and the tomato-based sauce doesn't get overwhelmingly creamy. &#160;The pizza was similarly tasty; the crust is crisp and even though it's a little thing, I appreciate that the arugula is diced up and not just splattered on your pizza - it's hard to eat whole leaves of arugula in tiny bites.The cocktails that we ordered were good (a Fresca hmm that was refreshing and light, a cucumber fizz that the boy liked, and a whiskey something that the boy also liked). &#160;The server accidentally heard "Diet Pepsi" instead of "Jack and Coke" when I ordered my second drink though, which confused me (we figured this out upon sipping the disgusting Pepsi-colored drink and looking at the bill later), and wasn't frequently present throughout the entire night, though she was friendly enough when she was. &#160;When we got downstairs (around 10:30 or so), there were some people halfheartedly attempting to dance, and more people standing around looking cool with drinks in hand. &#160;We left. &#160;Thus, for the restaurant aspect, four stars. &#160;For the nightclub life, (there's not really a dance floor, just a space between the downstairs bar and the lounge booths/chairs) two stars. &#160;We'll split the difference. You will have fun in Alibi room if you are with a group of close friends. Enjoy some delicious pizzas, good drinks, and go downstairs to dance the night away. Do not be alarmed by the small space of the dance floor or the seemingly lack of decor. The DJ is very good and the people are friendly, open, respectful, and unpretentious (yes a rare find). If you get tried of dancing, try two things: - Take a picture in front of the colorful and meticulously decorated wall;) - Watch the movies they show on the two TVs. The choice of movies is trippy, but awesome. When Pikes Place Market is dark and empty, the party is secretly happening at Alibi. &#160;It is like going to a private club. &#160;The upstairs has seating and the downstairs is a dance floor on Friday and Saturday nights. &#160;I don't think I have ever had to pay cover. &#160;I was pleasantly surprised by how good their pizza is. &#160;The fresca drink is tasty and a perfect way to start the night before dancing. Went on a Friday night at around 7pm. &#160;Crowded and so, so very loud that three of us were unable to hear each other. &#160;Our server was abrupt but prompt with a dash of rude sprinkled on top. &#160;The pizza was great - can't go wrong with there. &#160;Just prepare to yell at eachother and enjoy some good thin-crust pizza served atop giant tomato cans in the center of the tiny table "so the drunks don't knock them over." &#160;And don't joke about stabbing the cans with your fork/knife - I think they have heard that joke one too many times.The food, service, view, and ambiance was so much better about 10 years ago. &#160;I miss the old Alibi Room. maybe i feel a bit ornery right now, but here goes...if you have visitors in town and you want to take them to a "cool seattle place" then you got your winner. &#160;not to be a hater, but you can definitely get better food elsewhere. &#160;they don't have to do anything special except stock what i want for beer. &#160;and they do that. &#160;so all in all, it's a it's a very good, solid place, but i can't give it 5 stars. &#160;would rather do 3.5. &#160;grrrrrr. I'd like to rate this 4.5 stars, but alas, Yelp is half-star deficient. I went to the Alibi Room after reading Yelp reviews, and once again I'm glad I Yelp. We ordered the Spicy Mac and Cheese (and like most mac n cheese it seems, it was not actually Macaroni pasta), which was kind of like macaroni and cheese with salsa mixed in. That's sounds weird, so that's not really a good description. It has a cheese sauce, with chunks of tomato, red bell pepper, and onion. It is definitely spicy, but is not super cheesy, hence the 4.5 stars. My husband loved it, and nearly picked up the dish and licked it!We also ordered the Pine and Swine pizza, which for those of you who may be a little slow like me, this is Pineapple (not pine nuts!) and Ham. I think the ham is from a local vendor, and is super "hammy" and delicious. It does not taste or look processed, and are actual chunks of ham.I really enjoyed the "How bout a Fresca Hmm" mixed drink, which consisted of Ruby Red vodka, fresca, and grapefruit juice. Hubby likes girly drinks, and he really liked the Mai Tai.This place has some funky art on the walls, which looks like it is for sale too. They played some good music, and had a really fun atmosphere. Didn't make it downstairs to the dance floor. I would totally come here again for some great pizza and some fun drinks. we walked right past it the first time because we were so distracted by the gum wall. &#160;this place is a hidden gem with stiff drinks and fun characters. intensified on halloween! This place was just ok. We sat at the bar for drinks and the bar tending was spotty (wasn't really that busy either). Seemed like there were a lot of people that thought they were too cool hanging out. The downstairs area is small. Cool location. There's no better place to kill the germs on your tongue after licking the gum wall across the alley from the Alibi Room.Please, serve me the strongest alcohol you have so I can sanitize my tongue. &#160;Who knows what's been on that wall?Absolutely loved the ambiance - low key, great bouncer (thank you, Don, for the recommendation!), and just an overall hip hangout spot for all you aged hipsters here in Pike Place!I am still feeling the Cucumber Gin Fizz. &#160;So refreshing and awakening you were, yet you kept me buzzed. AWESOME!
The California. Toasted. With a side of BBQ sauce. Go there. Try it. Be happy. Man, these other guys are right, these sandwiches are deluxe. &#160;Tubs is a great sandwich place because it has a whole lotta varieties so it never gets old when you go there... unless you like go 50 days in a row ;). When you first come in prepare to pick up a menu and spend a few minutes picking what you want. &#160;There are three sizes of subs to choose from: Mini, Small, and Large. &#160;What happened to medium? &#160;The large is about 10" and the small was only a bit smaller than that. &#160;So if it's your first time and you want to try things out the small is plenty for lunch. &#160;But man, the prices are a bit over the top for a sandwich in Lake City...about $6.05 for a small and $8 or $9 bucks for a large. &#160;The meals don't come with drinks or chips, so you have to buy them separately at around $1.25 and up. &#160;When you make your own combo it definitely adds up.Other than my gripe about the costs, this place definitely has it going for them. &#160;The bread is unbelievably delicious and the quality totally beats out the other sub guys (i.e. Q and SW).So if you're in the mood for some great sandwiches come here, but expect to shell out the cash. :)Oh yeah, you're probably not going to come here for the decorations... it's pretty bad (like twigs on the wall), but you gotta check it out for yourself! Tubs is one of those places you'll pass by a hundred times and never know it was there. &#160;I had passed it by too and if it wasn't for the stellar reviews here I doubt I would have stopped to check it out. &#160;I'm glad I did though! &#160;The sandwiches that I had here were awesome! &#160;I tried both the Southern Belle and the Firecracker. &#160;Both were very flavorful and well prepared with fresh ingredients. &#160;One thing to note though, the sandwiches take time to make. &#160;This isn't Subway or Quizno's with nearly instant service. &#160;So expect to spend a bit of time waiting for the sandwich, in my case it was about 5-10 minutes or so if it's busy. &#160;Believe me, it's well worth the wait. This is a place I really wish I could get up North to visit more. &#160;Sandwiche formula that works....delicious meaty sandwiches + dipping sauces = magic I eat many a vegetarian sandwich, but this place put such an interesting spin on it, I keep coming back. Who would think to add BBQ sauce and black beans? Not me. Some like it hot, and I am one of them. This place satisfies. This place is amazing, and the only thing I would consider changing is the cleanliness and the speed of service. But, for good food, it's totally worth it! I am not a sandwich fan at all....except for Tubs Subs. &#160;I would have never tried this place if a friend didn't recommend it. &#160;It's in a trashy strip mall on Lake City way near a gun shop...would you just drop in?? &#160;This is the best places for subs, ever! &#160;I love the tuna roll with tuna salad, melted cheese, pickled ginger avocado and wasabi mayo. &#160;They have so many different sandwiches that you would never think of. &#160;It's a great place to grab a sandwich a go. The small is huge and more than filling. &#160;You will not go home hungry. i love tubs. &#160;every sandwich with bbq sauce...i don't care what anyone says, i need to dip my sandwich in the bbq. &#160;i've had many, many different tubs subs &amp; every time i was pleased. &#160;i will make the 15 minute drive here on my lunch break to get a great sandwich.i'd recommend ordering ahead, especially during the lunch hour...check out the menu online and call it in. &#160;there's a special walkup register just for you when you get there. &#160;don't forget the bbq! Solid!! This place has the skills to pay the mutherf@#%*n bills!! I had the firecracker and it rocked and yes really good BBQ dipping sauce! They have a very wide variety of sandwich types and the hoagie is just about perfect, it has just the right amount of crustiness to softness ratio going on!
I'm sold the moment I walk in the door and smell the hops. The overwhelming hops. The hops that makes me happy, but would potentially be aversive to a non-beer drinker (Judas!). Luckily, the only reason one has to be in the hoppy area is to tell the host how many seats the group needs. Then, it's in to the well sealed seating area -- a restaurant within a beer factory!Hale's sells all of its own brews -- both the ones you can easily find in bottles and other seasonal or other hard to find offerings. Great stuff, especially if you're in to cream ales/stouts/etc. They also have a full bar, wine, and sodas for the non-beer drinkers who make it past the olfactory barrier of hops.The pub is spacious and comfortable, with a variety of seating options ranging from booths, to stools, to little lounge areas where you can catch up with friends over drinks.The food's not bad either. The burgers are decent, but the real selling point is the JoJos! I like fries, I like tots, but it's also nice to see something different on the menu and a mondo potato wedge with an endearing name is a tasty change of pace. Highly recommended, although with potato wedges one has to know they'll be a bit soft, so don't get them if you want crispy.The major downfall here is that your bill can add up quickly. The burgers are a bit pricier than other local places and, obviously, you pay a bit of a premium for good beer. I suggest you consider happy hour if you're worried.Pretty psyched to try brunch here at some point. Again, items looks a bit pricier than the equivalent at nearby places, but (a) the food was good enough that I don't mind (b) they have Zoka coffee and (c) I won't buy the coffee -- I'll have a morning beer! Oh Hale's.How you surprised me. Im a fan of their beer that you can get at the grocer - Red Menace and El Jefe &#160;being good solid easy drinking beers. I was expecting to at least like what I was drinking. &#160;For a Pub this place has a bit of style going on. No crap on the walls, no loud music and harsh light. They have a separate area for "families" (under 21 crowd) and for those over, and the "over" area suited my tastes just fine. Dimly lit. Comfortable (they even had giant squishy love-seats to imbibe on if you so chose).Beers. What can I say? I was in love with their Cream Stout (go nitro!), their Barely wine was super hoppy and flavorful, and their German styled lager was a pleaser (im generally not the biggest fan of lagers. Kudos to Hale's for making one i enjoyed drinking).The food, well. I was happy. Rockfish and chips that were ginormous. I finished the fish but had so many of the lovely seasoned chips left that even the boy couldn't finish them. Boy had their H.S.B burger -- Beecher's cheese, bacon, avocado. DAMN TASTY. &#160;I think he was more enamored with the beer and eating experience than I was (He said he wished we lived closer!).Also of note. Growlers. They fill them. And for pretty damn cheap compared to the prices I am used to at Pike's and Rogue. Left with a half gallon of Troll Porter and couldn't be happier,Will make it a point to come back and often. Good food, good beer, good service, GREAT place.. Seattle beer week, the bf and I have been wondering about this place and decided to venture down for dinner..When you first drive by the front of the building, it looks like some regular old warehouse, with a great glass entrance.. You walk in and the smell of beer is delicious, your senses are heightened, nose with the smell, eyes with the large tanks and you feel like you want to touch everything.. Or so I did..It was a Sunday and it wasn't packed, we got our own seats and checked out the menus.. If we had a basement and money, our bar would look like Hales Ales'.. We had some good beers, a double IPA to start with and a dark beer, I can't remember what it was but it was good! Both were smooth and full of flavor..The food was good too, we had the chicken skewers for an appetizer.. Nicely grilled and served on a bed of salad with asian dressing with peanut sauce.. I had the Flat iron steak, bf had the pollo con pesto and our friend had the cheese bacon burger.. The flat iron steak was flavorful, cooked to perfection.. The pico de gallo wasn't necessary as I didn't like it but the mashed potatoes were delicious.. The pizza had a nice crust but lacked in flavor, it needed a little salt to perk it up.. My friend loved the burger, the bread was crispy and just the right amount of juiciness..Overall, we had some great food.. Will love to go there again, and maybe sit outside in the courtyard they have.. Over the years I've drank many a Hales beer. I specifically love their Cream Stout, Cream Ale, Cream ESB and Mongoose. I've also eaten here many times now and have had both their veggie burger and their veggie pizza. The burgers were really good, but the pizza was nothing to write home about...not bad, just not great. This time around I went for the Swiss Mushroom veggie burger with bleu cheese and potato wedges. I was not disappointed at all with my food. It was dripping with cheese, the patty was a larger than usual oval shaped Gardenburger which was coked just right. The potato wedges tasted fresh. With dinner I ordered their 2010 O'Briens Harvest &#160;Ale which I really enjoyed as well. Overall myself, and everyone I was with enjoyed their meals.On a separate note, for a brewery I feel that their beer prices are a bit on the high side. I guess I figure that if beer is what they do best, and they do not have to ship it across state or country, &#160;it should be cheaper. Most other brew pubs I've been to are in the $3.50 - $4.00 per 16oz pint price range, but theirs are $4.25 - $5.25. Filling Growlers here is also expensive. This doesn't necessarily keep me away from Hales, just make me come here less regularly for beers. We stopped in @ Hales Ales last Friday afternoon as a part of our tour in the Fremont area. It is a pretty cool place. The pub is located on site with the brewery so you can watch them brew their stuff if they happen to be brewing when you visit. They were actively brewing while we were there. We both stopped in and had 4 samples that were I believe 6 ounces a piece. We were a little disappointed that they were out of at least 4 of their beers although I believe they were seasonal type beers. The price the for the samples does vary by sampler. I'd recommend this pub however it is kind of off by itself in a light industrial area which not all that much next to it as far as other restaurants and pubs are concerned. Go Sunday after the brunch crowd . &#160;So far, we've scored twice in a row going during a slow time...easy parking, good service, fresh food. I wanted greens, the man wanted non-greens so we split the difference and parked at Hale's since Ballard was overwhelmed with Sunday Market shoppers.I had the best Cobb salad I have had in a very long time. &#160;Large chucks of crispy, high quality bacon with delicious blue cheese with a nice creamy balsamic vinaigrette. &#160;Man decided to go with the turkey sammich and tater salad. &#160;The bread was awesome, turkey fresh and the potato salad homemade and creamy.Can't comment on the beer since we skipped it due to spring colds, but Hale's nut brown is always tasty. Hale's is an awesome brew-pub. They have a really great variety of craft brews that are made on the premises. And it's in Ballard right off the Burke Gilman Trail with a cool outdoor patio and industrial feel.My first trip there I rode my bike for brunch around 11. It was cool to have a beer with breakfast, though the beer was much better than the food. The brunch food was a little bland, kind of like what you'd get at a totally generic diner. We sat inside near the window.The second time there I drove with a few other people around dinner time (parking's kind of hard). I ordered a rockfish sandwich which was awesome! The other people with me liked their food too, dinner food was way better than brunch food. The beers were still just as good. They sell and fill growlers, which is also a bonus. I recommend it for atmosphere and good beer. I love coming to Hales on a gritty, drenching winter's night for a burger and a cream stout, my new comfort food of choice. There are a fantastic array of things that Hale's does well, nitro beer and burgers among them, and creating a cozy, hop-imbued ambiance to welcome you to when the weather threatens to drown you is at the top of that list. I like Hales beers, but I like Hales restaurant even more. Ok this place was more like a chain restaurant then a local brew pub. But it did the trick. They had a good cider on tap and a comfortable couch to sit on and knit. The BLT was OK at best, nothing exciting just your average BLT. The service was just OK to. The woman who seated me was WAY to friendly, just plain talkative... it was annoying, I really just wanted to order my drink and she went on and on and on. The guy who helped me after that was blah. Came over two maybe three times in the 2 &#160;1/2 hours I was there. Like I said... just OK. it's so so... I know it's a restuarant/retail environment, but I always kind of balk to pay full price for the beer at the brewery. &#160;Shouldn't you be able to get cheap beer by going to the source? &#160;I think the menu is a bit contrived as well. Good beer, GREAT FOOD! :) I'm a big fan of Hale's Cream Ale, and going to the brewery has always been a pleasant experience for me. It's just a regular, kind of laid back place but that's what's great about it! Lots of good pub grub - burgers and stuff. And of course, good beer. I'd definitely recommend a trip out. They are, after all, one of the reasons that Seattle is one of the best city in the world for beer lovers. So I give this two stars because I'm a beer drinker. &#160;Hale's has a great cream stout, and that's about it. &#160;Their other beers don't suck, they just don't stand out. &#160;Any of them, which is a bit of a disappointment.The food is standard "northwest" brew food and decent. &#160;The service has always been good. &#160;There are just so many great breweries around town, why bother with one that's meh? I am CRAVING the cream stout. If anyone knows of a place to get it in San Francisco, let me know. It was amazing! My boyfriend enjoyed the 2 beers he tried as well (the Am Ale and something else). The beef brisket was fine (we shared and he is more a brisket fan). Our waitress was great. Super helpful (with the Mariners score and the bus schedule and other things outside of her duties). The chocolate custard dessert was fantastic, esp with the cream stout.Only thing to change-- the lighting at the bar tables is TERRIBLE! I do not need to be blinded by the light, and I am short. Get a lower watt bulb and move the lamps up about a foot. Love the Red Menace and Fish &amp; Chips. Family friendly and cozy place to stop in the Fremont area. Recommended! Hale's Mongoose IPA is the best bottled IPA I've found. And draft is even better. It's got a great hoppy flavor. The Restaurant/Pub is great also. My only complaint is that it's in Ballard... and I live in the south end. Decent food, yummy beer...definitely a great place to chill on the weekend. &#160;The menu isn't anything special or out of the ordinary. &#160;However - the stuff they have on there (burgers, etc) is done well and is reasonably priced. &#160;I had a yummy portobello mushroom burger that had several people in my party wishing that had made the same choice I did.The beers are the star here - I haven't had a bad one yet - faves are Mongoose (and the Supergoose) and El Jefe. &#160;I'm really, really, really excited for the Hale's to be opening up in Silverdale and will make that one of my "go to" places for a burger and a beer. Wow. Just, wow. We've been on a quest to find the perfect keg. We needed something with wide appeal, but we also had to like it and it had to taste like it was worth not just getting Sam Adams. After calling all over town, I discovered you get the best service and prices by going straight to the breweries. So, first we tried Elysian, since it's the cheapest of the bunch. But, the ESB and IPAs weren't cutting it - too bitter for the masses. We considered Manny's (yum), but decided it was too strong (trying to keep the carpets clean and the neighbors happy). Then we tried Maritime, but their Lager was bland, the IPAs weren't as good as Elysian's, and the Hefeweizen had that classic "dirty socks" problem. Finally, in a flash of brilliance, my home-brewing step-brother remembered we were two blocks from Hale's.10 minutes later, we found the Red Menace and our Goldilocks keg was made. We also sampled a great Belgian Dubbel and the Super Goose. I also had an AMAZING cioppino there. Usually with seafood stew, at least one part is overcooked and rubbery. Hale's managed to get every part just right.I like the look of the place, too - casual, but clean and just the right kind of dim. The service was good, except when we started asking questions of the bus-girl. Rather than admit ignorance, she was just stand-offish. I've been here for two reasons. One for my friends memorial (R.I.P. Ken) and for HH.The memorial was held upstairs, they served beer, wine and had food out. It was actually very nice, tables were set up and a projector screen was playing. The staff was professional and attentive. I come here every once in awhile for HH. Reminds me of Ken a lot. My jobs not too far from here. My boyfriend enjoys the beer and I normally will have a glass of wine (don't go for the margarita- NO BUENO!) The wings here are meaty and surprisingly good for being baked! We tried the Chipotle ones- $4.50 on Happy Hour. I also have had the caesar salad and it was delicious. Definitely a place worth checking out. FYI: They do not do shots of alcohol... haha I was really in the mood for a shot when I got there, but they don't do those. Just mixed drinks, beer and wine. They told me to go across the street... love the Hale's brews, but do not care for the food :( Two things might greet you at any one time when you walk into Hale's- a blast of flowery hopps from their brew kettles, or the sight of half-naked people getting painted up for a naked bike ride. &#160;Ok, so the latter only happened during the Fremont Solstice, but it was too fun to miss.Hale's is good for a pub! &#160;Its almost always full, but not so full that a table is completely unavailable. &#160;The clientele is a healthy mix for those that like to people watch, and the atmosphere is pleasant. &#160;There are some quirky dishes here that bear mention: &#160;The BBQ Nachos are quite good, as is the Bleu Cheese Burger. &#160;There is a European cheese and meat plate for a lighter, tapas-like taste. &#160;And for dessert... how about an ice cream float made with their cream stout? &#160;Its really tasty!Above all, worth a try. &#160;The beer sampler is highly recommended. &#160;Make it a game! I'm not sure why this place isn't more popular for breakfast/brunch on the weekends. After trying multiple Portage Bay locations and being told the wait was more than 30 min. we came across this place. Great food, service, reasonably priced and the best part was we didn't have to wait! ate here tonight on a saturday night. my roomies had just biked 54 miles around lake washington and this was their destination.came in and had the turkey and cranberry sandwich with a side of potato salad (sandwiches come with your choice of a side). the bread on this sandie was a *real* piece of bread, not your typical pre-sliced white fluffy thing. piled high with red onion, thin layer of cranberry sauce, tomato, turkey, lettuce (some kind?), and artisan bread. on the side was a dill pickle (crunch and salt) and in-house potato salad. let me tell you this stuff made the whole night a success. seasoned with stone-ground mustard, it wasn't over powered by the mustard flavor, but each bite of potato was covered in delicious mustard seeds. mmm. mmm. This is a brew-pub. &#160;You know, where they server beer, and pub food. &#160;Hales isn't my favorite beer, but I do really like the Nitrogen taps they have, and they usually have 2 or 3 on any given night. &#160;They also have food (I mentioned that) that is just fine. &#160;The burger is HUGE and they actually cooked it medium rare for me. &#160;Try that at most places and they'll look at you like you're nuts. They also have a full bar if that's your bag. &#160;I have never had bad service or food here, but I've also never been blown away. &#160;Viola - 3 stars. Super good food... check, nice decor... check, good beer... check, friendly service....check and a super cheap bill at the end... yep... check!Little far for me to get to but if it where closer to me I would probably be there everyday! This place is great. If you read no further, at least you've read that. :) It has very cool relaxed atmosphere. It's not noisy or annoying like so many places. My first impression was the smell of the brewing operations in the entry. You walk in the door and the first thing you see is all the brewing equipment. If you're the curious type like me, you'll enjoy the fact that the hardware is labeled with a little description as well. The food was excellent. They didn't have a huge selection, but I loved what I got. I ordered the HSB burger. Initially I thought it was a little pricey at $15 for a burger, but it was huge and came with a delicious side salad. It was totally worth it and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again. The beer is what they really focus on here, and it shows. I ordered the Cream Stout and couldn't be happier. It was delish! The service wasn't great... at first. I guess he was at the end of his shift, because he didn't introduce himself, and took a good while getting back to use to take our drink order despite it not being too busy. So that was a bit disappointing. But after that, the food came out rather quickly. And the waitress who replaced our waiter was quite attentive. I can't wait to go back. Hales you continue to disappoint. Spending Wednesday evening checking out your happy hour wasn't my first choice, but I was open to giving you another shot. We even discussed staying for dinner, but once again, you failed. Miserably.Our easy going group of four was regularly ordering drinks, beer samplers and food but our server couldn't be bothered to put on a happy face. We even inquired about purchasing a keg (!) for an upcoming birthday party, but he continued to be pompous and generally inattentive. The food was bland and the atmosphere boring. Even though your bar is in the middle of a brewery (which should be awesome), it manages to be boring. I felt like I was sitting at a Shari's for the early bird dinner special. We tried this out based on advice from my parents, and, overall, I'm not disappointed.We went for a late lunch on a Sunday, so the restaurant was pretty empty. What we ate:-Turkey Cranberry Sandwich: Pros - Essential Baking Co. bread; REAL turkey with a nice smoky flavor; fresh green salad (not iceberg - yay!) with an excellent house vinaigrette dressing.Cons - Dry, dry, dry, even with the cream cheese, cranberry sauce, AND tomatoes. These are not expensive condiments, so please add more!!!!-Rockfish and ChipsPros: Appeared to be pan-fried, rather than deep-fried, which prevented the fish from being overly greasy. &#160;Breading was crisp and light; you didn't feel heavy after eating it.Cons: Fries looked crispy, but appearances were truly deceiving.What we drank:-Cream Stout (nitro) - Discovered I'm not a fan of nitro brews...not impressed. Lacked flavor and the mouthfeel was horrible.-Wee Heavy Winter ale (seasonal) - EXCELLENT! I loved the flavor, crispness, and gentle sweetness of this ale. Highly recommend.Overall, pleased with our experience. We'll likely be back to try more brews and maybe some apps...skipping the sandwich next time. The suggestion of dining/drinking at Hale's always elicits a "Meh" from me, but I'm not entirely sure why. &#160;I suspect it's because I find the place to be just okay. &#160;I've never been a raving fan of their beer, but they do make pretty okay beer. &#160;It's not outstanding, but it's certainly better than many options out there. &#160;In fact, a quick perusal of Hale's beers at http://BeerAdvocate.com yields Bs almost across the board - good, but not great. &#160; I do rather enjoy the Red Menace Amber and Mongoose IPA.As for the food, it's also okay. &#160;I haven't had anything outstanding on the menu, but I haven't been disappointed either. &#160;The portions are pretty respectable for the price, and there is a nice selection of options for sides, although french fries is not one of them. &#160;They do have jo jos and mashed potatoes, but no fries? &#160;I realize jo jos are basically thick-cut french fry wedges. &#160;But they're not fries.The service is typically pretty good, especially if you're sitting in the bar area. &#160;Service in the general seating/family friendly section can be a little hit and miss, but it does trend towards the hits.The bar is definitely more comfortable than the dining area. &#160;Where the bar area is brewpub cozy and intimate, the dining room feels kind of sterile and harsh, probably due to the high ceilings and echoey space. &#160;But the dining room is family friendly so you can bring the whole family for lunch or dinner.One thing I do have to give Hale's major props for is their participation in the annual Moisture Festival. &#160;They give up their warehouse to be a performance space every year, which is really cool of them. &#160;It's always nice to support businesses that support the arts, especially when they also make beer. This place had a ton of their own brews on hand, i orderd a sampler of everything, and uhhhh, needed a lot of help finishing it, i believe it was like 23 different beers when i was there, pretty freak'n sweet, on the Seattle beer list for sure...Would like to see them on the east coast some more though.
This is my comfort food stop. A big bowl of veggie pho to fill my tummy always makes me feel better. If you don't like the decor, order it to go, they will have it ready in a minute. No seriously, 60 seconds and I have my to go order. If you are an interior design fanatic who demands pampered service, this place is not for you. If all you want is a cheap big bowl of pho, welcome to your mecca.
Great place for a small, satisfying lunch. The food is fresh, the prices decent, and it's got a good, walkable location for Belltowners. That is the key -- this is for Belltowners. If you're out of this nieghborhood, you can probably find a good, if not better, alternative in your area, This place isn't worth a walk or drive unless you're local. Their super meat nachos are delicious -- as are their big burritos. The portions are big so you'll be satisfied with your meal. It's a vast step up from Taco Bell, a bit of a step up from Taco Time, but not as good as most sit-down Mexican places -- except Mamas, which is spotty as all hell. Normally I love TDM. &#160;I work downtown, so I've gone here a few times. &#160;With tons of time in between. &#160;So my experiences shouldn't be faulted on one or two people. &#160;You get the feeling that the owner &amp; the entire family work there, which is fine. &#160;One day while waiting, I noticed an older lady emptying the garbage. &#160;Fine, right? &#160;Except she went right into stocking cups. &#160;GROSS! &#160;I had to say, "Uh, hey - wanna wash those hands before you touch that?" &#160;Which normally I hate being a pain. &#160;But...gross. &#160;Went there again a week ago - incredibly small portions. &#160;Not used to that @ other TDM's. &#160;For $6, it should be bigger than a tiny ass burrito from Taco Bell. &#160;This location sucks.
Soooooooooooooooo good and in cute Roosevelt Neighborhood- My deal is to go here for an awesome burger served by hot guys or friendly cute gals and then go to Peaks for this amazing Frozen Custard stuff you gotta have it (also served by hot guys or friendly cute gals). but, really - the burgers are the best here and I love my burgers- they use like vegetarian cows and it's cute and , well , the help is soooo nice too. Quality stuff not to be missed out upon !! Why 5 stars you ask? Good question, here's some reasons:-The Staff know us AND our orders-I've brought all of my out of town guests here...and they're hooked. Seriously. i get texts containing phrases such as "CRAVING SOUNDERS BURGER NOW" or "YOU SUCK...and you KNOW WHY" -It's down the street and around the corner from me abode-Not once ordered something i did not like. Burgers, chicken, fries, shakes...you.name.iti less than three you RC Burgers-you're one of the best things about mah hood... DELICIOUS! and HOT! Best burger I've had in Seattle, hands down. We like to try a variety of burger places, and since this one is close to our mechanic but not in our neighborhood, it was a rare treat that we stumbled into it two weeks ago. I've been back three times since! Their blue cheese bacon burger is seriously amazing. I also tried the "Mariner" burger and it was very delicious, combining avocado with the bacon instead of blue cheese. They seem to know just how to crumble the bacon on so it gets infused into every bite without falling out of or slipping off of the stacked burger. Sweet potato fries and chocolate shake were good too. Friendly service, fast, and very accommodating of us with our small child. Decent food.Great variety of burgers at reasonable prices. The bun was fresh, but nothing gourmet. The toppings were tasty and well put together. I enjoy they didn't smother the burger in too much sauce.The patty, unfortunately, was dinky and McDonald-esque.Take it or leave it---the place produces a good-tasting burger, with delicious shakes. Nothing exceptional, but nothing to avoid, either. I found this place while walking through my new neighborhood. &#160;I am a sucker for a good burger so I figured I would stop in. &#160;The sign outside definitely drew me in - Sounders colors are easy to spot in Seattle.I ordered a blue cheese and bacon burger, fries, and a soda. &#160;It was all very good. &#160;Paper cups for condiments were provided on the table, and there was a bottle of sriracha available next to the fountain machince. &#160;I mixed that with my ketchup for a delicious fry sauce.Prices were very reasonable and I felt very satisfied with the food. &#160;I think the highlight of the experience was the service. &#160;The guy at the counter was really nice, and engaged me in conversation from the time I walked in until the food got brought out (they weren't very busy at the time). &#160;He made me feel like a regular, despite the fact that it was my first visit.The portion of fries was bigger than average, and the burger was really big. &#160;The slices of bacon were thick and crisp, as were the red onions. I really enjoyed my experience at Rain City Burgers and I will definitely be back. Wow, there burgers are FANtastic! Non-greasy and very high quality ingredients. &#160;This is a repeat type restaurant. &#160;Very small eating area and atmosphere is fast foodish. I work at the bank down the street, so I always need to grab a quick lunch. This place is decorated with soo much Seattle galore, it's kind of amazing. Quick and really friendly service, decent prices. You can tell the burgers are made with clean high quality ingredients, burgers aren't greasy whatsoever. Fries are cut well and crisp.Definitely coming back! Solid! For all us byproducts of industrialized, commercialized baby boom generations RCB presents a burger that surpasses all the major fast food chain burgers and provides simplicity to an all American classic eat, without the frills and thrills overpriced, quick serve gourmet burgers joints on the market tend to offer.RCB does the thin patty right. The soft sesame bun lightly toasted, laced with smokey special sauce, filled with chopped green leaf lettuce, and standard toppings encompassed around a thin beef patty cooked through but moist enough, exceeding expectations of usually dry thin meat patty. This ingredient combo plays up for the perfect mouth bite. From bun to bun without dislocating your jaw, each ingredient is bit, observed, chewed and liked with no back out the bun slide out. This is why I like RCB. For roughly 10 bucks you can go and have a couple cheese burgers and fries. What a deal. Their hand cut fries are some of the better ones. They cut and fry. They don't go through the double cooking process of blanching then high heat frying. They are cut and fried. Small pieces, long pieces, a half soggy piece, the pieces that stab you in the gums if your not careful, a brown fry, a golden fry. I love my fries like that. Burger shop fries.I would like it if RCB posted what producer they are buying their beef from. Accessible information for the public to observe what is that producers definition of NATURAL beef. As the defintions of NATURAL are very ambigous and left to the producer to define.To give RCB another shout, good job on making your to go packaging all food waste. This is a huge plus. RCB, my goto spot for affordable burger fulfillment, but truthfully I stick with the vegan boca burger 70% of the time. Same tasty flavor and a bit more earthy because of the boca flavor profile. All you born again vegetarians that were force fed Micky D's by your abusive parents will like the boca burger at RCB.See full breakdown at the Cookin Better website. Link in profile Consistently good food &amp; service every time I'm here. &#160;I always come here with at least one kid (mine), and often his friends as well. &#160;Ordering food at a counter for three 10- &amp; 11-year-olds plus one or two adults gets complicated. &#160;Leave off the lettuce on this one, add mushrooms to that one, extra cheese on that other one, 3 orders of tater tots...no make that 2 orders &amp; one of parmesan garlic fries, and so on. &#160;I really try to make it simple, but it never is, and it never matters. &#160;They're seamless here, and have always gotten our order right, no matter how difficult. &#160;Down to bringing out enough ranch for all the boys even though I only remembered to ask for one. &#160;It takes a village.The veggie burgers I get aren't quite as transcendental as the ones at that Phinney Ridge place I go sometimes, but they're very good (the mushroom swiss one especially) and the total experience of habit-forming sweet potato fries, accessible counter help if someone decides after the fact that they DO want fries this time after all, actual seats available, and the ability to pay with the card in my pocket puts them a star ahead. Oh my gosh, these burgers were awesome. Their ingredients are so fresh and shockingly not greasy. They have a really good homemade sauce, and their fries are excellent. I wasn't super hungry, otherwise I would have opted for a milkshake--they looked amazing! The little restaurant is not really a place you'd wanna sit and eat, but it's cheery and has a ton of Seattle pride, it's just... tiny. We got our burgers to go, as did everyone else in the restaurant at the time. They have some cool varieties of burgers, so I can't wait to go back and try more! (They also have Mango Lassis, if you're so inclined. Score!) If you live in the Greenlake area, and you've never been here, you may be surprised at the existence of this place. Located on the Northwest corner of 65th St. and Roosevelt Ave., it's conveniently located near Whole Food Market. When you ask a Seattle-ite for their take regarding the best burger in town you'll likely hear "Red Mill" or "Kidd Valley", maybe "Zippy's". However, I'd argue that Rain City tops all of the typical Seattle burger favorites.What sets this place apart is the balance and quality of ingredients used to generate a melody of flavors. The menu is vast, and includes vegetarian and chicken burgers with descriptions that sound harmonious in flavor, although I haven't had a chance to try non beef burgers. The menu is pictured below. The beef patties originate from grass-fed cows, which are flavorful, but not excessively greasy at the same time. I've had the bacon and blue cheese burger, which has a nice zing from the blue cheese that complements the beef. The BBQ burger has a tangy blend of A1 and BBQ sauce, and serves as a great complement to the beef and sauteed onions. The fries here are well seasoned and fried to an ideal crisp. The only drawback to this place is that it's small (approx. 5 tables) and that it's hard to find a place to park. However, the quality of the burgers (and fries) more than makes up for these limitations. Burgers are delicious all natural, grass-fed and &#160;the bacon is nice and thick just the way i like it!The onion rings are not a good value. Having been here only one time, I will definitely be back. &#160;I had the chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries, which together totaled around $8. &#160;The chicken breast was tender and bigger than the bun dripping with their special sauce. &#160;A very good experience Rain City. &#160;I am glad I work nearby. Host: &#160;n/aCashier/waiter: 3.7Food-taste, presentation: 4.0Property-style, decor, ambiance: 4.0Fresh and delicious! Rain City Burger Very Delicious.Not fake burger,or fried.The milkshakes taste organic.Delicious food and breath taking.My favorite is the Mushroom Burger and sweet potato fries and chocolate milkshake.Heidi This was my go-to burger place when I lived in Seattle. The eating area is a little cramped, but totally worth it. You can order to-go, but I loved chomping down on some natural beef while reading The Stranger and watching people on Roosevelt Ave (there were some odd folks). One of the many things I miss about Seattle is the amazing food, and this one tops the list. I recommend the Hawaiian burger if you want something sweet or the Sounders burger if you want a kick. We stopped into Rain City Burgers after a day of not eating. &#160;We were hungry! &#160; I ordered a basic, regular burger, w/o the sauce, and with the onion grilled instead of raw. &#160;My spouse had the Chicken Masala burger. The service was friendly and fast. Both burgers came out quickly, &#160;neatly wrapped in a brown paper wrapper. &#160;The burgers were excellent with high quality ingredients. &#160;The Masala Burger definitely had a spicy kick to it. &#160;Yum for both burgers. &#160;A nice, small and friendly place. &#160;I plan to return!
We went about a year ago... the experience was mixed. &#160;We've heard either REALLY good things, or REALLY bad things. &#160;So feeling lucky, we tried it.My partner had the special, which had an interesting Hawaiian/Asian flair to his pasta dish. &#160;It was amazing. &#160;Very unique, very tasty, and something I wish became part of their regular menu. &#160;I had some generic thing on the menu... and as you can see, it was forgettable. &#160;There were some odd things about the place1) &#160;The location is odd... and I'm surprised there is "late night dining" because I'm not sure who would go (but apparently people do).2) &#160;We saw lots of young people on dates there... but I dunno, it just doesn't seem like a place I'd try to impress someone with. &#160;If you go by earlier we've always seen old people there: &#160;mmm, soft food! &#160;3) &#160;The menu starts by talking about how the chef cooked for President Clinton, and how wonderful he is. &#160;The food doesn't seem to measure up... but, was kinda interesting, and filled up time from staring at the tacky decor (I remember lots of mirrors... that was weird)Can't really explain it... but it was just a strange experience overall. &#160;Mixed meal, strange atmosphere. &#160;The staff was very friendly, but I'm not rushing to go back Hmmm... &#160;I had a good experience at Pomodoro. &#160;Got there @ 10:50 (they close at 11:30)... &#160;We were seated immediately. &#160;The waitress was very helpful, which is good, 'cuz it was hard enough to choose between so many tasty-looking items. &#160;They were out of salmon, a main ingredient in many dishes. &#160;Their bread comes with a light avocado-garlic spread instead of butter (Damn Good!) &#160;Tapas included Mushrooms in Olive-Oil and Pomodoro con Aceto Balsamico (Greens and tomato with spicy Balsamic Vinaigrette) They were pretty good, but not great. &#160;Main Course: &#160;Slow-cooked pork belly with peaches (canned...)and a peach-rosemary demi-glace. &#160;It was artistically arranged on a plate with four teeny-tiny scooplets of mashed potato and a piece of zucchini. &#160;The pork was cooked perfectly, crisp and flavorful on the outside, fatty and tender (pulls apart with a fork) inside. &#160;Mmmm. &#160;For the same price as average-grade bar food. &#160;Fairly small portions. &#160;Low-key, classy atmosphere. &#160;Open until 11:30. We wandered in here at 10:30 on Wednesday and were the only customers in the place. We had a couple of glasses of wine and two tapas. &#160;The calimari was excellent and so was the tomatoe tapa that we had The food was bland. I used to have such a hard time finding a good Italian restaurant and was hoping to find it here. I did not. Luckily since my experience at Pomodoro I have discovered Il Terezzo Carmine which is a great staple, and new comers like Trovolata. I know The Pink Door is always a sure thing too. Having these options makes Pomodoro a waste of time. There are many new Italian joints popping up that I need to try too. I am glad I have so many options and will not need to try Pomodoro again.
I was told that the chocolate croissants here were the bomb evidenced by the fact that this bakery was the only US entity to have ever won some type of French baking contest. Ok...so the first time I get there, it is around 1PM and the croissants are sold out. The second time I get there at 11AM and I got the last two. They are good - no crazy sugary chocolate, slight sour cream taste in the soft dough, but actually tasted a little bit stale. Did they really make them that morning? Overall, I give those croissants a 6 out of 10.Neighborhood is really lovely so I was surprised that staff were not cleaning up the tables and supplies area after patrons. Here's the deal. &#160;The coffee and food are very good. &#160;The service is not. &#160;The employees seem to have all been trained to be completely indifferent in their customer interactions. &#160;They are neither speedy nor friendly. &#160;One or the other, if not both, my friends. &#160;That's all I ask. I've been going here for years (work in 'hood), it's pretty &#160;consistent. Today I had the bacon swiss crepe and it was well prepared, golden brown, cheese, bits of bacon throughout. I also love the caprese grilled sandwich and a few of the pastries. They aren't my go-to pastry place ( love Le Fournil and Le Panier) but good coffee and decent bakery items. I love this little bakery! I go to the doctor right around this area and never even knew it was there! My mother and I went here for lunch and it was such a hidden gem! I had a half soup half sandwich combo which was a really good deal and only, like, $5! The reuben was awesome &amp; I had the soup of the day which had sausage, some kind of green veggie, and potatoes...also delicious! My mom had a special that was a curried chicken salad that did not look quite as good...it was 2 times the price of my meal but had about a quarter of the food. This is a great place for lunch specials though if you're in the area! The staff was extremely helpful and friendly, too! My mother stood there for about 10 minutes deciding which kind of baby tart to buy a friend...I'm not a dessert fan but they looked absolutely wonderful! I used to be a regular here but I can't take it any more! &#160;The service is terrible, I always feel like s*** when I am ordering, even when I order the simplest of items: Ham &#160;&amp; Gruyere croissant and a coffee, to go. &#160;They consistently forget things and then act like you're putting them out when you remind them. &#160;I have to admit &#160;the food is excellent but the service is consistently the worst I've experienced in Seattle, and that's saying something. &#160;Luckily there is an extremely yummy bakery/cafe next door with some wonderful people working there so I go there instead and I recommend you do too. &#160;It is called Bella Dolce, and their amazing chocolate chip cookies are only $1. &#160;I just wish they were open on Sunday!
Your friendly neighborhood restaurant/bar won't dissappoint with its home-style offerings at palatable prices. I'm guilty of getting "sloppy-seconds" to every restaurant Kevin S has already reviewed since he's the one introducing me to these new places. But it's always good to have a second opinion, right?The restaurant looks to be on the edge of quiet Seattle suburbs and could even be difficult to find (judging by some people's confusion on how to get to/from there). There is plentiful street parking.Upon entering, I was first in awe of the size of the restaurant. It's been a long time since I've seen SPACE inside a restaurant. Wow! There's even room for 2+ people to walk side by side! There's a large restaurant side to your left and a bar (with a few more tables) if you continue forward. The middle area is no-man's land. There's a few tables and a large tv here, but I have a feeling this section wasmore for seating overflow on the restaurant side. The decor is simple, a few surfboards on the walls, and couple large projection TVs. The seating is comfortable and looks like it would accomodate large groups well. The bar also has a small karaoke area which some people were into.We sat in no-man's land since Kevin S wanted to watch the lakers(!) game. We didn't get service for a bit since the staff thought we were with the party in the back and were just hanging out. No biggie though, once she knew we were there, she was very friendly and helpful. The menu is straight-forward and offers a wide range of Hawaiian choices. I went with the beef stew. The prices seemed very fair, and from my experience with Hawaiian food, you will never be left hungry - they give heaping amounts of everything. Such was the case with Kona Kitchen too. Heaping amounts of rice and macaroni salad. Most places have gross mayo-flooded macaroni, but Kona Kitchen's was very light and made a very good side dish. Other Hawaiian restaurants' I've tried put way too much mayo and is way too heavy. The beef stew tasted like a standard crockpot tomato based stew. Nothing about it seemed "Hawaiian" to me, since it tasted like something my mom makes all the time as well. Next time I'll try some of their other traditional offerings and hope to get a better taste of what is truely hawaiian food. We hit up the bar after we ate - but due to the party size it proved difficult to hang out there so we brought our drinks back to the table. The bar was surprisingly very well stocked. I'm guessing the place becomes a local sports bar on game nights.I'll definitely keep this place on my list of places to satisfy my hunger for home-cooked non-greasy meals. Great little restaurant run by Yuji (he's the bad guy from Karate Kid II) and his wife. &#160;Their beef stew and kalua pig are top notch. &#160;The staff is very personable and as a transplanted Hawaii-boy I find the place very refreshing. &#160;Definitely worth checking out if you're longing for a taste of the islandsOh and they pour some stiff drinks and according to my friend who watched every Seahawks playoff game there - their breakfast apparently is also up to snuff. &#160;Note I cite a friend as I rarely ever wake up early enough for breakfast (i'm more of a night owl).
Great little place. A pal with a long history of working in food service recommended them. Not sure I'd have stopped in without the recommendation, but SO GLAD that we did. It's small but comfortable. Nice fancy big tvs. Pleasant bar and some nice tables (with very tall/impressive looking benches). The food menu (happy hour ALL DAY, every day, with purchase of alcohol) is above-average pub food, for sure. The lamb sliders were very tasty. When you bite into them, you get this amazing burst of lamb juices, and there's an interesting sauce, too. The Mac N Cheese is a thing of glory. Rich and cheesy and amazing, and they'll add bacon for $2 more. The orders of fries (variety of types from sweet potato to regular) are $4 and HUGE. You get a giant plate of fries for your money. The salads looked surprisingly fresh for pub food, too. Pleasant atmosphere, tasty food for a great value, the bartender is great fun. Nice place.
The good:* Easy online ordering* Quick delivery * Delicious and plentiful pizza toppings (artichoke hearts, whole roasted garlic cloves, sun-dried tomatoes)The bad:* not even close to enough sauce on the pizza * missing celery sticks that were supposed to come with the wings* tomato slices that were so underripe that they were light pink at best, and green in some placesThe weird:* sunflower seeds on a Greek salad? I have no idea if the pizza is good - i just ordered. &#160;but Ryan the person that took my order was splendid. &#160;He is, by far, the most helpful, friendly, charming pizza order taker i have ever dealt with. &#160;i think i have a crush on him! My husband and I stopped by for lunch and what a treat for our taste buds.The Cobb salad was a very generous size. And very very fresh. From the crunchy lettuce to the freshly made Bacon bits. The pizza was just as yummy. The crust was a golden brown and the cheese nice and gooey... We will diffently will be back.. and the service was very friendly and fast. Wanting fresh salad and yummy pizza Luciano's is the place to go!
There's not much to say about BK food in general but I wanted to say this BK has a very good staff. We live close by and order from here often and they have only messed our order once in all the time we've been coming here, which is pretty good for fast food places! And when they did, I called them and told them we were coming back for the missing burger, no biggie, no questions asked, my son went in with the receipt, came out with a burger!
This is a long overdue review. Please do not EVER go here. Please, not even if your life depended on it! I had lunch here once because I was too lazy to go farther and wish I hadn't. I ate some kind of a sweet and sour pork and it gave me diarrhea in a matter of 20 minutes after leaving the restaurant. No, that's not it. The worst part is the fact that the runs and abdominal pain lasted 4 days and did not feel well for almost two weeks. I kid you now. My friends can attest to this and I dissuaded from ever eating at this place. Please stay away!!! I will not eat here ever again, not even if its free!!!! We really hated this place-- slim vegetarian options, unseasoned dishes (for both veggies and carnivores) and just generally bleh food.No point in going back there! Pros: Relatively low price for how much the portion is. Decent tasting food.Cons: This place is very dirty and and the tables just do not feel clean. This place has been shut down many times for health reasons. I personally haven't had any problems but there are much better places to eat on University Way. If you go to UW, you will go to UT. Simple truth.The portions are large, and the food is always at least decent. UT has a Chinese menu, a Korean menu, and now a sushi menu, so certainly more variety than your average teriyaki joint if chicken teriyaki with a side of gyozas just isn't cutting it today. Their (truly great) mongolian beef is my post-quiz section staple. I enjoy UT - the food is always consistent and cheap. The combos also come with rice and a side salad. My go-to is the spicy chicken teriyaki, the chicken katsu is also a fine alternative. I always take my food to go, as the other reviews on here have suggested, the restaurant isn't clean, and I'm sure they've had several health code violations throughout the years... but what asian restaurant doesn't? i ordered the chicken katsu and ended up getting a rock. i mean that both figuratively and literally. the katsu was so over cooked that it was tough and leather-like and i also found a rock in my food. I've been to multiple other teriyaki places on the ave and nothing compares to UT! It's hands down the best! I always order the chicken yakisoba, which is wonderful! Their portions are huge and the salad is always yummy! A great value and a must for any U.W student! LOVE University Teriyaki. I've tried all of the other locations on the Ave and just keep coming back UT. Prices are cheap and portions are huge, and I find myself sharing one of their entree portions with another person so it ends up being a super cheap meal. Service is fast, though I have to dock off a star because they reject requests for substitutions during busy hours or give you a funny look if you even ask. The only teriyaki to get is the chicken, all of the other meats are very dry and not good. I know it's personal preference but I like their sweeter teriyaki sauce. It's also nice that they serve froyo, in fact, they the first ones on the Ave to have froyo at a location lower than NE 45th and University. They also have TVs that show various sports games on--football, basketball, etc. Keep walking. Yeah you get large portions. But seriously, its like a trough of day-old reheated meat over rice. Not worth it. Go up the ave to Teriyaki 1st if your craving teriyaki. If thats to far get vietnamese, thai, anything but UT, expand your tastebuds This place wasn't AWFUL, but I didn't really like it. I got the tofu yakisoba. It was eh. There were way too many onions and cabbage, which I assume is because it's a cheap filler to make the dish appear larger. I'm not usually one to throw out half of my plate, but I did so at this restaurant. The building seemed fine, it didn't seem dirty, but then again I wasn't really looking around. I was focusing on picking out the ridiculous amount of onions. The portions were big for what you pay. The tofu was okay, but it had kind of a strange flavor to it. The noodles were decent. Overall just an 'blah' experience. I like Yummy Bites way better. The food is amazing there. Their Korean stuff is really good as well, but one of the ladies there (older lady, probably wife of the owner) is incredibly rude. I wanted to tell her she was really rude once and i would never do something like that, and i saw her being rude to someone else. If it wouldnt have been for her i would have given this restaurant 5 stars. Oh my goodness, this is a scary place. &#160;While eating, cockroaches were scurrying across the wall right next to the table I was eating at. &#160;I got so disgusted that I finally had to kill it myself. &#160;I mentioned it to the cashier and she just shrugged her shoulders.As far as the food goes, the terrikyaki sauce they use is literally the worst sauce I have EVER had. &#160;I guess that they think that if you're a student, you won't care enough, that you'll just wolf it down and move on.All in all, a terrible place and it's too bad. &#160;While other reviewers say their portions are large, it's not an excuse to have cockroaches running around your restaurant@! My friend used to work there. He said their grading for cleanse is rated an F and the boss is a crackhead and very lazy who eats from pots without cleaning them. But I think that's how it is when you eat out almost everywhere. I found couple pieces of bugs in my food, so gross. There was one time where I heard one of my friend saw a rat while eating there. Don't go there, your just eating food that taste good but it is actually contaminated. I don't know why people rave about this place. Their chicken teriyaki is always burnt and dry.
The happy hour here is amazing. I went here with fellow Yelper Jen K., who frequents this place, and was pleasantly surprised. First, the price, it was under $40, and that is for 4 drinks, 2 calamaris, and I believe 4 rolls!!! Like other yelpers said, I highly recommend the coconut cosmo, and I also recommend the yummy calamari, which after trying we needed to order another. Second, a great thing about this place is there is a large selection of items that are on special for happy hour. &#160;When you go here don't forget to order the chef's choice you will not be dissapointed. I hate these kind of reviews, but I'm gonna go ahead and be a hypocrite. After yelp supper, I went with soon-to-be-Yelper Jan to wait a few hours after having some Scotch. I didn't have any food, but the lemony water was excellent. Unfortunately for everyone, I got a tiny little sip of some expensive sake the friendly bartender was serving Jan. It tasted like bananas to me. Once I said it, no one could drink it because I was frickin right! :-) I didn't make it to Nijo's much hyped happy hour, but I still enjoyed my meal here. &#160;I sat at the sushi bar and wasn't feeling very decisive, so I just ordered a sashimi platter, and the first thing the chef did was ask me what I liked and didn't like, which was pretty sweet and something I've never encountered before. &#160;No stinkin' ebi wasting space on my sashimi platter! &#160;Even better, the platter came with a generous portion of wakame salad. &#160;It was a generous amount of food for the price, though the fish was served a little on the warm side and I was a little unsure of its quality.Nijo was also my first encounter with a spicy hamachi roll, but it was unremarkable and I kind of thought it was indistinguishable from spicy tuna.They also had an extensive sake menu with knowledgeable servers, but I was barely able to scratch the surface of their selection. &#160;The sake's presentation was &#160;as swanky as the rest of the restaurant. &#160;The service was friendly and helpful, but tasks were distributed between the sushi chef and a waitress, and getting the attention of the waitress was a little more work than it should have been.I'm not entirely convinced I'd come here for full price dinner again, but I'd definitely hit their happy hour. Great sushi - try the Chili Cha Cha. It will add some spice to your life, and light a little fire in your belly. In a good way! Loved the atmosphere and the Black Bottle sake - also very nice poke (WITH octopus, thank you very much!) toro! &#160;toro! &#160;toro! tuna belly from blue fin tuna and yellow tail tuna (hamachi toro). fresh and tasty. thanks to mobile yelp, we discovered this downtown sushi spot just before flying back to SF. &#160;if you are into sushi rolls, this is the place. a very good selection of sake as well. next time I make it to Seattle, i HAVE to come back for the legendary happy hour.
Its very surprising to me how its so hard to find a vegetarian salad downtown. So if you like the meat free salads, your best option is to make your own. Market Fresh has unparalleled salad bar selection downtown, and this is my favorite location. Even when I worked across the street from the Ranier tower I preferred to walk to this one. Be warned, though. Salad bar eating is an art. Its taken me years to craft the perfect $6 salad. With all the yummy selections its easy to get carried away. Three cheers (and 4 stars) for quick, healthy food! &#160;I love that the produce is organic and you can have as little (or AS MUCH) of whatever you choose. &#160;The salad bar is great, but some of the entrees leave a bit to be desired. &#160;And the flava'sava' heat lamps tend to dehydrate certain foods (like the hot ticket item, salmon fillets). &#160;But, overall it is a great place to put goodness into your belly, avoid the post lunch carb coma and save dolla'dolla bills, y'all.
Coa has a fantastic happy hour, and an amazing selection of tequila. While the barman is happy to guide you through a flight of sipping tequilas, and you should try this here if you haven't already, I chose a couple of appetizers (the sopitos with asada were excellent and more than enough as an entree) and a margarita. Not made from a supermarket mix or sweet and sour, but real lime juice, the margaritas were not too sweet, but were just right, and it was very difficult to stop after just one. They do have a patio, and - even without a lake view - this is a great spot to grab a drink on a sunny afternoon. The first thought that comes to mind about this place was how EXCRUCIATINGLY slow the service was. And it wasn't busy either...there were 2 other tables with people there and that was it. No big party and obviously not a full house by any stretch of the imagination.It was just a weird experience overall. &#160;When I came in the server was doing double duty as the hostess, and when I told her I had a reservation she gave me this incredulous look - was it because I wasn't speaking to her in spanish like the other hispanic people that came in after us? She then kept asking/confirming my name the whole way to the table and after I handed her a voucher I had purchased for COA - as if I was going to slip and give her a different name or something. After we went around in circles confirming the name on the reservation, confirming the name on the voucher, and confirming the name on her iPhone app for said voucher she finally asked if we wanted to start with drinks. &#160;Before shuffling off to get our tequila flights we asked for water while we figured out what we wanted on the menu. &#160;After 10 minutes she came back with the flights and chips, no water and then disappeared before we could order our food. &#160;Another 5-10 minutes later she came back and took our order. &#160;The food literally took almost another 20 minutes to get out to us and all we ordered were to apps - truffle fries and empanadas.The truffle fries was a huge plate full of delicious toppings and the right amount of fries...however the fries were soggy/undercooked. &#160;You could tell that they were fried twice but not long enough either time to give them a good crisp exterior with the soft interior. &#160;They were limp soggy, greasy pieces of potato with a good amount of cheese sauce on top. &#160;The empanadas on the other hand were the opposite - they might as well have been dried out Jack in the Box tacos - super crispy and overcooked shell with what could have been easily mistaken for chicken jerky for filling...Thankfully the nice server brought over water just before bringing over our appetizers or else I would have probably choked on them. I will give them that with just those appetizers that was filling almost to the point where we could have ordered one more appetizer or ordered dessert and been good for the night.I do have to say that I'm glad we only stuck around for apps and drinks, I feel that if we had gone with a full meal here we wouldn't have been out of there before closing time...for the record we clocked being out of there just a few minutes under 2 hours from the time we arrived to the time we walked out the door. I came back here the other night with my boss for early happy hour and wasn't as impressed this time around. We sat in the bar and tried to order off the happy hour menu, but the menu was very limited. We ended up ordering the fish tacos and sharing them, and then I also ordered a carne asada taco off the happy hour menu. I had a house margarita, and while it was just as good as the time before (not too sweet!) it was still $6 on the happy hour menu. I have no idea what it is priced at normally, so that makes me a little less likely to order one during normal dining hours. The food was still great though. We got out of there for about $22 for the two fish tacos with rice and beans, one carne asada taco, one margarita and a glass of the house red. Plus chips and salsa! They do have great salsa. We ventured out at the end of a snowstorm to give COA a try. &#160;We were a group of 3 adults and 3 kids so we went pretty early and basically had the place to ourselves. &#160;The staff people were friendly and helpful. &#160;The restaurant is a cute little place (seats maybe 30-40).We ordered a couple dishes to share, margaritas, and tacos for the kids. &#160;Instead of chips and salsa, they served a crunchy snack that could be dipped in the hot sauce on the table. &#160;The food was made with fresh ingredients and not covered in gloppy cheese and refried beans like at Azteca or other "Mexican" restaurants. &#160;The burrito was quite tasty and the pork mole served on squash puree (I believe) with a side of kale was delicious. &#160;The kids were mixed on their review of the tacos, but they are picky kids. &#160;Margaritas were pretty tasty and a bit different.My complaints would be the somewhat slow service, the price of the food (a little high for the amount you get), and apparently no happy hour food. &#160;We were under the impression they had a happy hour menu, not just drink specials. &#160;All in all a pretty good dinner - we may go back but it's not high on the priority list... This is one of our neighborhood spots, so we've been here a few times. We were excited to hear about their arrival in the neighborhood, because we love Mexican food, especially authentic types of the non-chain restaurant variety.The service has always been fine when we have been there and we like the food. My main complaint is the portion size. For prices a little bit above the aforementioned cheap chain restaurants, the portion size is a bit too small, particularly on sides like rice and beans, which you would think would be relatively inexpensive for the restaurant. On our last visit, both my wife and son had side salads that could fit in a mini-ramekin.The margaritas are definitely tasty and now come in slightly larger glasses than before. Cute, quaint and very close to my friends apartment, so we decided to walk over and get a drink.Interior: SmallService: SlowMargaritas: Wheres the booze?Happy Hour Menus: Begrudgingly given to us after requesting it twice.Food: Incredibly DryStaff: Very friendly.Fun to try some place new but even with the friendly staff, we wont be going back. First visit tonight. The place has been nicely redone since Divine sadly departed. After reading the reviews, I can understand why this place is rated as such, but for the most part those things didn't really bother me. The service pace is pretty relaxed which was fine until we wanted to pay and had a wait a bit for the credit card ipad. We got menus, chips and salsa right away. It did take the waitress some time to finally get to us and take our drinks orders, but then everything came out pretty timely from that point on. &#160;The house margaritas were a cut above the standard fare and the food was pretty tasty (tostadon &amp; chile verde). Only complaint food-wise is that I like my beans thicker. The experience was good enough that I'd come back for hh sometime if I'm in the vicinity. The longer happy hours (2-7pm) are appreciated.Summary: Good, but not great. Don't go when you're in a hurry. If you go soon, they have some holidays coupons on their website. Apparently you need to print them. Not sure why a restaurant with ipad receipts/transactions can't accept me showing them their coupon digitally. Exceptionally good Mexican food (caution: not Tex-Mex). The chicken mole was perfectly balanced, the pinto beans would win any cook-off as they are subtly flavored and al dente, and the blasted kale was a brilliant addition. With Mestizo and Gallerias gone, this may be the only serious Mexican (see earlier caution) kitchen in town. The place is quirky too, which you'll appreciate if you are, too. Went there for dinner last night as we had a meeting close by and wanted to eat somewhere in the vicinity. The service was pleasant, and we were seated in the bar (at our request) promptly. The table snacks were delicious, and by far the best thing we ate. They were some type of savory crisp treat in a wagon wheel shape, served with a mixture of pickled cabbage, red onions, tomatoes and fresh herbs. I literally could not stop eating them. The Paloma beverage was just as described and very refreshing. The entrees however, were very disappointing. While they were beautifully plated, they weren't much in the flavor department. My carne asado tacos were nothing more than some chunks of dried out meat (bland) with a mere smidgen of pickled cabbage. I had to ask for lime and some salt just to make them palatable. The beans served with the entree were very tasty, but not very hot. The rice was flavorless. The salad was comprised of huge slices of jicama, super long strings of beets, with some greens and radishes. Very difficult to eat. The dressing was nice, but it seemed to be an afterthought. &#160;Spouse's "wet" burrito was not so wet. It was very dry and despite the drizzle of two sauces over the top of it, bland. I would not recommend the place, and will not be going back. Mediocre food. slow service. not what we want in mexican food Inventive and good Margaritas but food was not very flavorful or great especially for the price. Service is also lacking a bit. Sat in a nice alcove in the bar. &#160;That was the best thing about it. &#160;Service was slooooow, waiter was overly friendly trying to cover the slooooow. &#160;Food, when at last reached our table, was mediocre at best. &#160;Many reviews here cite the excellent margaritas. &#160;No argument but they won't bring me back a 2nd time. I'm basically re-iterating what everyone else is saying here: &#160;the food is bland, dry and way overpriced. &#160; The service is inattentive. &#160;My only hope is that the proprietors read these reviews and get their act together. We were excited to try out a new Mexican restaurant in Seattle. We were not excited afterwards.I can see where the inspiration and the ideas about the restaurant are going, and I like it. Small, friendly, atmosphere and classic Mexican dishes re-imagined with some new flavor combinations, contemporary design, and good tequila. The menu is certainly more interesting than the normal Mexican fare and the presentation, at least on the web site, is meant to draw in foodies. It's that inspiration that pulls in the second star for me.Unfortunately, the execution does not live up to the inspiration. I ordered the Enchiladas Montadas, which promised a sunny side up egg over the enchiladas and beans. That sounded great. What was delivered to the table was a thoroughly-cooked hockey puck that used to be an egg. That egg had been neglected on a hot grill before being placed on top of the already-cooling enchiladas filled with far too little chicken. The sauce of the egg yolk was to be an important component and putting that piece of rubber on the plate shows a lack of professionalism and care. Serving that egg and then not understanding why I wanted it replaced shows a lack of awareness on the part of our server. (The egg that arrived, seven minutes after asking for it, was properly sunny side up, although it's clear that the hot grill was a problem, as the bottom was a little crispy.)Oh, our server. Or, should I say servers? We were never really sure who our server was, as three different women took orders and brought food and drinks to our table throughout the meal. None of them, however, brought over a pitcher of water. My water glass sat empty at the edge of the table for half of the meal, even after asking for it to be refilled. One of our servers spoke no English at all, necessitating that every request made of her be repeated to one of our other servers. We believe that explains the empty water glass and the lack of additional tortillas which were asked for, but never delivered.Paying for the meal was the kicker. The iPad application they use for credit cards has defined tip levels of 15%, 20%, 25%, and None. There is no way to enter a specific tip amount. The service was not deserving of a 15% tip, so we chose None, which is the default selection in the app.
This place was recommended to my husband and I so we decided to try it out for breakfast recently on a Sunday morning. &#160;I'm not sure how long the Salmon Bay Cafe has existed, but I'm guessing a while. &#160;It definitely seems like a favorite with the locals. &#160;The inside was outdated, but I enjoyed it. &#160;It seemed like this is what Seattle once was, twenty years back before Seattle was inundated with "transplants." The menu had a ton of options. &#160;I personally thought the menu was flawless for breakfast options. &#160;I loved that most breakfasts came with the choice of home fries or fresh fruit, as well as a cinnamon bun or toast. &#160;I chose the fruit as a healthier option and it was fresh and delicious. &#160;I also ordered the special, which was a chorizo scramble. &#160;My husband ordered the sausage gravy and biscuits. &#160;I didn't want toast or cinnamon roll so I ordered the cinnamon roll and gave it to the hubby. &#160;He scarfed it down happily.If we had good service, I would have given this place 4 or 5 stars. &#160;That was the only thing that was really "off." &#160;The waitstaff was friendly, but seemed like they didn't care and were floating about casually. &#160;The kitchen staff seemed to have no problem pumping out the food, however the timing was off. &#160;I saw people around us getting food at nearby tables, but not everyone was getting food at the same time. &#160;Dishes were literally coming out 5 to 10 minutes after each other for the same table, and then it happened to us. &#160;My husband ordered home fries and they didn't come out with our food. &#160;Our server said they would be right out, but after getting ready to finish our breakfast, we asked where they were. &#160;He realized he had forgot about them and went back to the kitchen, returning with potatoes that looked boiled then slapped on a greasy skillet for a few seconds. &#160;The potatoes were not browned at all and had not been seasoned. &#160;Overall the prices were very good, portion sized generous, and I was very happy with my chorizo scramble. &#160;The flavors of everything were good, however the sausage gravy was just ok. &#160;I would definitely return though if in the Ballard area, but with hopes of improved service. Located in the harbor area of Ballard. I got the meat lovers Omelet and it was pretty damn heart attack maker, in a good way. The pancakes could use a little bit working on but i was too full to finish it.Don't expect fancy breakfast lunch place because it is not, but the food was good and the price was excellent.Staff I thought was really nice and friendly also.Portions are huge, food was delish to me, price is cheap. this gets a thumbs up in my book! "Bacon should always be eaten with butter" said Hollie, my fellow classmate after pretty much licking her plate after finishing her bacon waffle. And you know what, arteries be damned I agree!We were a pack of hungry museology students -- with a craving for breakfast and drinks come lunchtime. A little quick research and we hit this greasy spoon for what was declared as "the best lunch we've had together yet."Interior is what you would expect from you standard diner, large booths, white boards with the daily special, and some semi-hairy clientele. We were seated quickly and a round of mimosa's were ordered first thing. And holy cow. Talk about a GIANT mimosa. Nearly big-gulped size -- when it was brought to the table I was certain my drink would cost more than my lunch item, but nope. $5.95 and you can be pleasantly buzzed before it's 12:30 pm.We all ended up sharing, and I opted for the stuffed french toast. I mean, how could I say no to raspberry cream cheese, bananas &amp; fruit topping? Well, im glad I didnt -- and the fruit? Holy crap -- more bananas, pineapple, cantaloupe, blueberries, and a side of toasted pecans to polish it all off. Huge portion and groan worth table round. Seafood scramble - amazing! The biscuits and gravy stuck to your ribs and real biscuits used here - light fluffy and definitely not from a can. The real winner of the afternoon though was Hollie and her bacon waffle. The moment it was placed on the table we all had to take photos of it then attack it with our forks. It's a life-changer I tell you. You just probably don't want to have it for breakfast all the time since it came with a generous pad of butter and plenty of warm maple syrup for your bacon to swim in.It's cheap. It's good. &#160;&amp; if you are like me and my friends you will return to class smelling of bacon and booze. I really like this place. I work in the Ballard area and I don't start till 10:30. So that leaves me with enough time to relax, have a nice breakfast and people watch. The waitresses are all great, not too intrusive which is something I always like. Their hot coco is served in a big mug and tastes delicious! But my favorite is their scrambles! Joe's Scramble to be exact, it has sausage, spinach, mushrooms, sour cream and parmesan cheese (I might be missing something) but it's great and really filling. You also get to choose between potatoes and fruit. I've tried both. Their fruit is fresh and tasty. But I have to admit, I really like the potatoes. Over all I really like the place. You should check it out.
Considering I've been working in the area for a little over 4 years, this was my first visit.My department had won a Halloween contest at work and eating here was part of our prize. &#160;We ordered Caesar Salad and 5 pizzas. &#160;My boss had pre-ordered everything, so that by the time we sat down, we didn't have to wait very long. The service was quick and the food was okay. &#160;Nothing fancy about it. &#160;Their pizza taste like any other ordinary pizza.Will I make another visit? &#160;Maybe, just to try out their other dishes since I didn't even get to open a menu. This is a good pizza place. &#160;Every pie is hand constructed with a wonderful crust and great toppings. &#160;I've yet to order the Calzone but that is coming soon. Whenever I visit Seattle, I always have at least one dinner at Varlamos.For $10 you get a football-sized calzone (make-your-own with 3 ingredients) and a salad.Note: the sausage is spicy! heartburn beware!Seating is plentiful but this pizza spot is favorite to the locals and frequents large groups of youngsters (7-12 yr olds) so you may want to try a reservation if you have a large group.They typically have Macks and Fat Tire on tap :D This is my favorite pizza place in town. Not too thin or too thick. There are a lot of fun toppings to choose from. &#160;I always add gorgonzola for an extra kick. They also have some of the better chicken wings I have had around town. The service is attentive and friendly but laid back. This is definitely a family spot. Stopped by here for an early dinner with a few friends and was not disappointed It's a no-frills, family friendly and wallet conscious spot. For $10, I created my own football-sized calzone and a salad to start. The calzone was hearty and i loved the pepperoni, sausage, bacon masterpiece I created. The service was quick and casual. Varlamos great for a large group or just a few, and I will definitely be going back! Varlamos is great. We live nearby and have been going to Varlamos for 8 or 9 years. The food is consistently good - the salads are super fresh (they cut them there daily, none of that pre-cut bagged stuff that wilts on your plate) with house made dressings, great Greek pizza, pastas, and - wait for it - legendary calzones. I grew up in Spokane, home of Pete's, The Calzone King. When I moved to Seattle to go to UW, I never thought I'd see the likes of Pete's calzones again. I thought I'd died and gone to heaven when Pete's expanded to Seattle and set up shop on Roosevelt in the early-mid 90's, but then they closed a few years later (I am still wondering why). After that, every calzone I'd try at another place just didn't measure up...doughy crust, no ricotta...the worst part was that places wouldn't bake the sauce inside the calzone, but would serve it on the side instead. This is just weird. And forget my favorite topping/filling, broccoli - I just gave up on that. Enter Varlamos. someone had told me about their Monday night special - a calzone and a salad for $7 or something - so my husband and I decided to check it out since it was close by. The place had a rally laid back atmosphere, and was really busy with neighborhood clientele - families, kids' sports teams, groups of college students, retirees. We sat down and opened the menu, and there it was - broccoli. I knew this was a good sign. We both got the Monday special - my calzone with broccoli and ricotta, of course, and his with sausage, onion, and green pepper. The salad that comes with the special is full sized, and yep, the calzones are, as advertised, football sized. And with sauce on the inside! It filled the void that the closed Pete's on Roosevelt left in my heart. We've been back many, many times since then (we went every Monday for a couple of years), and I've tried the pasta and pizza too (both good). The wait staff is pretty much all UW students, and the owner is always there, either helping out in the kitchen or chatting with customers. Every once in a while we'll get a flaky server (usually a girl whose sorority sisters have decided to come visit her at work), but the microbrews on tap and great food make up for it. We have a daughter now, and she loves Varlamos too...did I mention they have a good kids menu and a basket full of Dum Dums up front? Varlamos is fantastic! Friendly and attentive waitstaff- always refilling water glasses- and the calzones are huge and delicious! Go there on Monday nights for half priced calzones! They are fabulous and it will fill you up for days! Good luck finishing one! Service is poor. Mostly inexperienced UW kids, it would seem. Awesome calzones! These monsters really are football sized as advertised. There are a ton of filings to choose from, so you can create anything you want. The meats seem to have some kick, which is how I like them. The crust is how it should be golden brown on the outside and chewy on the inside. The mozzarella is high quality, which you don't get everywhere. The calzones come with a nice side salad. For just over $10, you get a meal that's hard to beat. Mondays are when you can get them for even cheaper, which is an absolutely fantastic deal! We love Varlamos!!! &#160;It is a great value for the amount of food you get and the food tastes great. &#160;We almost always get the same thing which is 1) a made-to-order calzone that comes with a great side salad (try the blue cheese dressing as it is amazing) and 2) the chicken Caesar salad. &#160;The calzone/salad is under $10 and I always ask for a box to come at the same time they deliver the meal. &#160;The calzone is huge and I put half away for lunch the next day! &#160;So 2 meals for under $10!!!! &#160;Some nights can be pretty busy --- I think Monday or Tuesday the calzones are on special for even cheaper. &#160;but you can call in your order and take it to go even!FYI - most of the servers are college kids from UW, which some people might not like.
They no longer offer 2 tacos for $1 but since this is a couple blocks from my home I still stop in here occasionally. If you happen to be in the area you should definitely check it out.Located inside the ABC Supermarket, it's a little chilly. Wear warm clothes, unless it's summer time. And be prepared to wait since she mostly works alone and it can get busy.I usually get carne asada here. If you're wanting carnitas then you'll want to go down to Tacos El Asadero. I also have vegetarian friends who eat here as well and appreciate the quite reasonable prices. I tried the El Delicioso Deli which is inside of the ABC Market on Beacon Hill, because they were running a 2 taco special for 1.00$ and I have to admit that it was pretty good. I like that even though the tacos were kind of small the ingredients were fresh and tasty. Unexpected were the single slices of radish that were inside of both of my tacos, but again I did enjoy what I ate. I'll admit though that being inside of ABC Market is kind of drab when I look at it and its a situation that kind of influences me to think a bit more about people who struggle to get by every day and the economic depressions that America has faced. Not that it has much to do with how tasty the tacos were, but I'm thinking that if the weather is good that I may decide to get my food to go outside next time I stop at the El Delicioso Deli.
I think this is one of the nicest Taco Times in the city.The food is consistently top notch and fresh tasting. &#160;I have been to some other TT's and it can be hit or miss.The fish tacos are my current favorite, you must eat it within seconds of it being made though. &#160;That way you get the nice crunch from the fried fish- mmmm! &#160;But DAMN they are expensive for a taco!They also get props for having the hot sauce in the giant ketchup dispensers. &#160;Good thinking!Sup with not having a soda fountain for people to serve themselves refills? As a long time fan of Taco Time, they would really have to do something terrible for me not to give them lots of stars. The reason they get only four, though, is because of some of obnoxious teenagers they choose to employ. These kids need to learn some manners when handing me my soft bean burrito!
You got Soul?!I wanted to do a Soul Review since today news of Don Cornelius death, the creator of Soul Train and this also reminded me of Soul Wednesday. When I have a day off from work and in the mood for soul food... my go to spot is Catfish Corner for the Wednesday special of Gumbo!The Seafood Gumbo is one of the best I tried with a lot of chicken, beef sausages, shrimp, crab and creole sasonings! It also comes with side of rice and crackers for only $10.50. &#160;It sells out quick so call in for takeout.I also recommend getting either a half or pound of catfish with their special tarter sauce. The catfish is not greasy at all and it has a nice crispy texture with fresh tender moist pieces of catfish. The tarter sauce is sooo good, they sell it by the jar! The half pound of catfish will run you about $7.75 to $8.75 depending if you want bone in or fillet and $11.25 - $12.25 for a pound.I just found the hushpuppies &amp; fries just to be okay. Nothing special...so skip it.I never had the peach or pecan pie but heard ravings about the desserts!So if you want some Souuuuuuuuuuuuuuuul food, I recommend coming to Catfish Corner.I am g$, and we wish you love, peace, and soul!Tip: Only street parking in the hood and the service is slow so I recommend calling in your order for takeout. This place is to die for. Always fresh, hot and delicious. Their tartar sauce is so good, they sell it, and have it branded. The staff are super friendly, it is family owned and run. The food always tastes the same. Bits and Pups are my favorite--give me some bits with tartar and pups with honey and I'll be your BFF forever. They also make a killer burger, and everything else that is fried and fishy on their menu is great too. Certainly a favorite place of mine, and it is ALWAYS worth waiting in line, even if it wraps around the block! Okay... deep fried food is good almost anywhere. But here it's beyond good, it's excellent!Having tried catfish only a few times, I was stoked to come here after hearing such great things. The menu, much like the menu at In N Out, is really simple and easy to read. With just a handful of options, you know the food is good because they focus only on what they're good at. A friend and I shared a half pound of friend catfish. Cooked fresh and piping hot, I loved that the corn meal fried fish wasn't greasy or too flaky. It was just perfect! Can't wait to come back for more. I am not from the South, so I don't have a ton of experience with fried food or gumbo, but I can tell you this place has delicious food. My friend and I went in to try it out yesterday and got the 'Catfish Plate' special for lunch. The catfish was served in a spicy sauce and came with 4 delectable hush-puppies and a side of tartar sauce. The fish as surprisingly good as were the hush-puppies dipped in the tartar. We liked our meal so much that we decided to come back again today for the gumbo special. Holy Crab! They load you up with Alaskan crab and shrimp and sausage. The flavors were rich and meaty. Included was a small side of rice to add to your bowl. Loved it! Friendly service too, definitely coming back. I love catfish, I love greens... Catfish Corner didn't disappoint. I think I'll have to return for the seafood gumbo! JR This is a great place for some tasty southern style food. &#160;I tried their fried catfish and red beans &amp; rice. &#160;Both were perfectly cooked and I felt the portions were right on for the money. &#160;The tartar sauce was the perfect complement to the catfish, and I'm pretty sure it's homemade by Catfish Corner. &#160;I would definitely recommend this place for a quick meal in the Central District. Good food but not great. I have had catfish all over the US. This would be middle of the pack to me. &#160;I am glad I came to check out.
When we took our seat at this diner, our waitress started by explaining how much of the food and drink were locally sourced, fair trade, and organic. &#160;She pointed out their signature items, and made some friendly and welcoming chit-chat. &#160;We felt comfortable and welcome, something I'm getting used to feeling here in Seattle! &#160;The food was hit-and-miss. &#160;I had the Eggs Cordova which was really delicious. &#160;The eggs, salmon, and bacon were perfectly cooked, and the fresh chanterelle mushrooms and sweet peppers were an unexpected flavourful addition to the dish. &#160;My partner had the buttermilk chicken sandwich and poutine (some grease b/c we had enjoyed Seattle's late-night hospitality the night before). &#160;We're biassed as Canadians, but I think poutine is probably best left to the experts in Quebec. &#160;As for the chicken sandwich, it was just ok, nothing special.The service here was exemplary, the prices on the high side of reasonable, the atmosphere was comfortable, and the food generally high quality. A wine merchant up the street recommended Steelhead so I popped in for a light, late lunch on a Friday in mid-October. The restaurant looked full, which is certainly a good sign, so I sat at the bar. The Alaskan razor clam soup, coleslaw, and bread with butter/oil were delicious, and the bartenders were very attentive but not overly so. Great view, too. My biggest thrill? They pour Chateau Smith cab by the glass. I was told the winemaker frequents the place. My only regret? I live too far away and can't take my wife for dinner! Hungry. Need Food. It's Late. OoOoOOh Bright Light. ooOoOh Still Open. OoOoOh Menu looks good. Must go in EAT!!After making it alive through the Underworld Tour in Pioneer Square at night and polishing off some drinks. Finding a place to fill up our hunger driven stomach was our numero uno priority!We wanted something good since it would be our last night in Seattle and what better way to end the night eating a nice dinner at Steelhead Diner! But really..I saw the bottles of Hanger One displayed at the bar which said..yea..this place should be good!For starters we had the Jumbo Lump Dungeness Crab Cakes : Yummy! Crunchy!The Miss had the half order of Kasu Marinated Black Cod w/ baby bak choy, and &#160;shiitake mushrooms. Her dish was very good! The Cod was cooked perfectly. Sweet and tasty!http://static.px.yelp.co&#8230;I had the half order of Red &amp; Black Wild Alaskian King Salmon w/ roasted butternut squash cavalo nero &amp; hominy polenta. My salmon was good. My fish was also cooked very well. The sauce was a bit strong but it complimented the salmon. The Polenta was yumms. http://static.px.yelp.co&#8230;The ambience of this place is pretty cool. Modern. Open. But a bit on the dark side http://static.px.yelp.co&#8230;. l was surprised at 10 o'clock this place was still busy.The service here is pretty good. The waiter was attentive and the wait staff here is friendly. Good Eats! Jet-lagged and hungry (to the point where I couldn't make any kind of decisions), I saw the sign that said "time to eat." So I did! I didn't want anything too heavy, so I went with the razor clam chowder. Being a New Englander, I didn't know what to expect, and I was happily surprised. The broth was white but not too creamy, and jammed with potatoes, corn, and other veggies; the clams were tender and luscious. When/if I'm in Seattle again, I'd definitely go back. I got to watch the sunset here, and the bar has an amazing view. My hubby and I were in town to visit family and catch a game, so we stayed nearby and just happened on this wonderful place. &#160;It was a Friday night so we did wait a bit, but it was absolutely worth the wait.We had the caviar pie, as suggested by our server. &#160;Great way to start the meal, it was a beautiful presentation, very impressive.I had the Ling Cod and I decided that it is my new favorite fish. &#160;Too bad I can't seem to find it in LA. Service was wonderful, I am looking forward to going back to Seattle just to have that caviar pie again! Granted, I was extremely hungry when I came here, but I LOVED this place. &#160;It was a surprisingly nice "diner" with really tasty food. &#160;I ordered the Rich Boy sandwich (sausage sandwich) and my friends ordered a salad (don't know what it's called but it had cheese and candied walnuts on mixed greens) and the blue plate special (catfish on cheesy grits). &#160;Everything was really good, and it had a good combination of spiciness and heartiness. Given how hungry I was I should have killed my entire meal, but I the portions were large enough to where I had to pack half of my sandwich to go. &#160;Sadly, I gave my leftovers to a bum when he asked, and I've been regretting it ever since... What a fun spot! We had reservations for six and changed to seven, then down to four and ended up with five! They could not have been nicer! The place was full on a Thursday night. Good sign. They had a full bar. Great sign! They had a window into the kitchen, another good sign. We all got settled and looked at the drink menu. Nice listings! Nothing really new or exciting but they had some great standards and a couple purple drinks. Always festive. We started off with the Beecher's fried cheese curds. You know me and cheeses . . . . amazing! its just amazing how people keep coming up with better ways to eat cheese! We had the beet tar tar also. I wasn't sure what to expect and we were pleasantly surprised! I actually craved it a few days later! Dinner was a Ribeye for me, I Loves me a good ribeye! This one didn't disappoint! One cool thing about the diner is they have smaller portions available for almost every main dish and salad! What a great way to eat family style or to share a couple things with friends! The atmosphere was cool chic diner, the prices reflected a downtown spot more than a diner, but it has booths and counter searing, like a diner, but its got a full bar and hip feel. The staff was great and the manager, Arn came by and checked on us! We will definitely be back! As Craig David so famously asked, "Tell me, what's your flavor?"I don't think this was mine.I was kind of bored to be honest.But then again, what did I come in expecting?It is your usual diner with an upscale slant. A wolf in sheep's clothing. Trailer trash in some horrible Juicy Couture get-up with Coach accessories. You can smell that stuff a mile way. Sometimes, they have the ability to prove you wrong. Nothing on the menu looked appetizing... the ingredients seemed inspiring (such as the Chicken and Sausage Gumbo and the Smothered Steak) but nothing stood out to me as something I wanted to eat.I have had little great experiences with people being uppity with fare that is meant to be cheap and delicious (I am a dirt food connoisseur - mind you), but I tried the macaroni and cheese.It was good. We shared it as an appetizer and then I played like a 6-year-old and ordered it as a meal. Their drink list was hard to decipher, even for an alcoholic--but the vodka and fresh lemonade I scored well.I don't know if I'd come back, unless if someone convinced me. The best eggs Benedict ever!! (except they call it something else)Yes, it was $18 but there was so much crab I was sharing with other people at my table! It was the perfect size of bread (sourdough) and poached eggs with not too much sauce and so much lovely dungeness crab I could just scream! It was so so good!!! I want to go back now after talking about it.This is not your normal breakfast/brunch place--my brohter was craving toast with jam and there was no such thing, but it is totally worth it!! A Seattle City Tours tour guide (Daniel) recommended the Steelhead Diner. We thought we'd give it a try and were not disappointed. We went to the restaurant (it's not really a diner as one would think) just after lunch time on Sunday. The only available seating was a high counter in the dining area or stools along the kitchen. We chose the stools and not only had an opportunity to watch the chefs in action, we got to chat with them as well. One chef in particular started a conversation with my husband and it turned out to be Kevin, the owner! As we were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary, Kevin had them give us a "Slice of Caviar Pie". This is probably the best appetizer we have ever eaten. It not only is presented beautifully, it tastes like nothing you can imagine! We also ordered the butternut squash with apple bacon and it was scrumptious. Our sandwich order included the pulled pork poor boy and fried oyster poor boy - absolutely wonderful! We weren't in the mood for alcohol so we ordered sodas and were told they don't sell Pepsi and Coke products - instead they sell a local Jones soda - again a fabulous beverage! This was the best meal we ate while in Seattle and highly recommend the Steelhead Diner to tourists and locals alike. The atmosphere and service makes you feel like a local. Christopher was our server and we never had to ask for anything. Thanks Kevin - you have an awesome restaurant and we wish you continued success. We only wish you were in our town as well. Jim and Sharon / Las Vegas okay, so my husband and I wanted to try someplace new and I found this place online. &#160;we saw a movie today and headed down to the diner to check it out....I'd been salivating over the prospect of a real, fresh, homemade fried chicken sandwich for a while. &#160;not one of those frozen patties thrown in the deep fryer. &#160;keep in mind, I'm a pretty good cook, so it's hard to find something better than my own food when I like things a certain way.today wasn't too busy in the afternoon....service was good but not spectacular. &#160;they started us off with a basket consisting of two gummy slices of some sort of seedy bread and a slab of cold hard butter drizzled with herb olive oil. &#160;where's the variety bread basket other reviewers wrote about?I got the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich and fries and my husband got a pulled pork sandwich and chicken &amp; sausage gumbo. &#160;my sandwich came decked out with a pile of cole slaw, a pickle, and the tomatoes I asked them to leave off. &#160;(I have to mention that every time, in every restaurant, when I ask for no tomatoes, my food arrives WITH tomatoes...ugh) &#160;I scraped the salad off of my sandwich and was left with nicely crisp yet totally unseasoned pieces of chicken breast on a dry baguette. &#160;this is not a full slab of chicken, it's pieces and chunks. &#160;there wasn't a condiment in sight. &#160;where's the mayo? &#160;fries were deliciously crispy, but way too salty. &#160;I think they used up all the salt in the restaurant on the fries and didn't have any left for the chicken.my husband said his pulled pork sandwich was dry as a bone. &#160;gumbo was good. &#160;again, salty fries.so all in all an OK experience....we'd probably go back and try something else. I've been to Steelhead more than I've been to almost any other restaurant in Seattle, and I keep going back not just because the food is so good but also because it's a restaurant whose philosophy I can support. The owners, Ken and Terresa, believe in sustainable, local food, so when I eat there I don't have to worry about where my food originated. Since I'm someone who's religiously traveled around the country with the Seafood Guide in my wallet, I am always happy to see it prominently displayed when I walk into the restaurant.But on to the food....It is comfort food done in more original ways, and is always viscerally satisfying. There are other places you can go if you want a more complex culinary experience, but it's hard to achieve the blend of familiarity and novelty that the talented Steelhead kitchen continually creates. The prices, for Seattle, are really great. The sandwiches are huge, and half the price of the entrees. Many of the entrees you can in fact order as a half-portion (which is wise, because the full portions are massive - yet you can't stop eating), and there is always a lengthy selection of not only tasty appetizers but soups and sides (usually veggie). If you like steak or pork or other meats, this is one of the best places in town to order those. They are the only ones who do my steak rare as can be, just the way I like it, so it's gotten to the point that this is the only place I'll order steak! Thanks for spoiling me, Steelhead....It does get busy sometimes because of its proximity to the Market, so reservations are a good idea. That's why they're one of the two restaurants saved in my phone. Go there: amazing food, total lack of pretense (you can see tourists, hipster-types, and families all in the same place), and a food philosophy that's becoming more and more important to endorse and support in our Pacific Northwest. I travel to Seattle on business quite often; every time I am in town I make a point of having at least one meal at the Steelhead Diner. &#160;The menu successfully marries elements of southern food with the fresh ingredients found in the Pacific northwest. Though the selections I have had from the Field and Stream section of the menu have been excellent, I always gravitate towards the Sandwiches. The Fried Oyster Po Boy is an enjoyable sandwich, as it is dressed New Orleans style and served on the perfect roll. &#160; Another great selection is the Buttermilk Fried Chicken sandwich; though fried, the chicken is moist and flavorful, the batter just thick enough to add texture to the sandwich but not overpowering. A Manny's Pale Ale compliments both of these sandwiches quite nicely.In terms of desserts; I have tried the Lemon Cake (I enjoy homemade lemon cake and rarely find it on a menu!) and it has been hit or miss with me - I have ordered it twice; the first time it was excellent, tangy and sweet; the second time the lemon curd overpowered the cake. Overall, the service is friendly and attentive, the location is hard to beat, and the menu has a little something for everyone, though some items appear ambitious in theory they tend to work well in practice. If you want an enjoyable, reasonably priced meal in a great location I think the Steelhead is a great choice. Because of my penchant for eating, I usually know the restaurant that I am going to patronize and the food that I will expect. This time around I didn't even think to ask my friend where we were going to eat... And sometimes this is the best because Steelhead Diner surprised and filled my stomach with the goodness of the Lord: Gumbo and Red Beans and rice!! My belly got a nice rub as a thank you for having such good food. When I first heard the word "diner", I automatically assumed that it would be burgers and breakfast food. Boy was I surprised when I walked in and saw the menu of salivation-inducing comfort food. Yes, they have gourmet burgers, but they also have pasta dishes, salads, sides of mac and cheese, and veges. It is a pretty complete menu that caters to every persons palate. You can be a vegan or a hearty-meat eater and fully enjoy a meal here. Since we had a reservation for 5 (Luckily b/c the place was packed for Saturday night)), there were 5 place settings waiting for us. The food menu for ordering is used as a placemat underneath your appetizer/bread plates and your glass for drinking water. The full wine menu is on the back of the food menu. The cocktail menu is in a booklet. After perusing the cocktail menu which has very innovative alcoholic ($9-$11.00) and non-alcoholic cocktails ($4-$5.00), I chose the Irrestible, a fruity alcoholic drink. It was really strong and tasted like a sweet tart. It definitely gave me a good buzz. Once we place our orders, they bring us a bread basket with a variety of choices from whole grain slices to herb foccacia bread. For spreading, they serve a triangular brick of butter coated/marinated in garlic oil with chooped green garlic leaves. It was all delicious and the bread was soft and moist. I just couldn't stop dipping the bread in the garlic oil. Someone ordered the fried cheese curds as an appetizer. The cheese is made of &#160;from Seattle's very own Beecher's cheese and it comes with 2 sauces for dipping (neither was marinara). These cheese poppers were perfect. They weren't oily and weren't so hot theat when you take a bite it burns your mouth. It's just warm enough that the cheese just melts in your mouth. MMMM!!! Some people ordered side salads as well. Though I didn't taste either, they were a sizeable portion and I mean that someone received a whole 1/2 head of lettuce with bacon and other goodies on top. I was almost envious that I didn't order one. Finally our entrees arrive and they are humongous!! I couldn't believe the portions. My red beans and rice ($6.95) was warm and moist with just the right mushiness and spice. The andouille sausage just made it so heavenly and divine. My gumbo ($7.95) was supposed to be a cup, but instead brought me a bowl w/o charging extra. It was so soothing to my stomach with the dark broth, okra, rice, andouille sausage, chicken, onions, garlic, peppers, etc. Since I knew I couldn't finish it I asked them to bring 5 spoons for everyone. No one could stop dipping their spoon in the gumbo. My friend even kept dipping the bread in the broth b/c it was so good. I was also able to taste others' dishes. The alfredo pasta with truffle oil ($14.95) and truffles was pleasing. The pasta was soft and the sauce was not too creamy. The truffles were perfect. The southern fried chicken was succulent and juicy. It was very crispy, but not oily and salty as other fried chickens and not just KFC. And it looked like a wole chicken from my point of view. I think that it was just a half chicken but maybe it was just that plump. The Alaskan Cod ($21.95) was softly flaky and moist. The sauce and garnish complement the fish very well. The cod just melts in your mouth. The vegetarian squash dish ($7.95) was the real surprise. It wasn't too sweet as expected and was very fragrant and flavorful with the ginger and cinnamon. The squash was moist and cooked to perfection. Overall, it was an extraordinary dinner full of laughs and fun. The noise level was fine, but maybe we just talk loud. The lighting is good and I could see everone's faces clearly through my alcoholic buzz. The waiters and waitresses were friendly and attentive, always filling our water glasses and even asking to fill our water glasses. This is on my list of definite returns or "Go To" Places in Seattle. I have always loved the food at the Steelhead Diner, particularly the caviar pie, gumbo, beet tartare and black cod, but its the EXTRAS that urge me to enthusiastically refer many people to this gem in the Market.The menu is simply FUN to peruse, full of surprising twists and word play. The food is always consistent, and the staff knowledgeable.I remember first reading about the Steelhead in a Nancy Leson column when it opened where she alluded to Kevin Davis as the friendliest chef in town. Yes, you can sit 4 ft. away from him at the kitchen counter and watch and chit chat with him. Quite fun! (I finally saw the Anthony Bourdain show from awhile back where Kevin was cooking geoduck three ways on a portable stove out on some remote beach for Bourdain; can't wait to talk to Kevin about that!)I refer tour guests to the Steelhead often. I know they will find something different and intriguing on the menu. It definitely is not your usual diner, and it represents Seattle cuisine well! My one gripe (I'd put my rating at 4.6 actually) is that it is a very busy place and too often I see favoritism by the bartenders, especially toward the young and beautiful. I worry about my guests who, like me, are older and ... ah ... weathered. Went here with a group of friends for a birthday...I knew that the place was small but I was surprised that they had a backroom. &#160;The decor was dark but very cool. &#160;I ordered the NOLA Fried Oyster sandwich which were accompanied with french fries. &#160;I traded half the sandwich with a friend for a NOLA Uli's Sausage sandwich. &#160;Both sandwiches are very good. &#160;The NOLA refers to the New Orleans, Louisiana Po' Boy style sandwich...dressed in mayonnaise, lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles on a french roll. &#160;Other peeps ordered the mussels, the fried chicken sandwich, mac and cheese, poutine, fried catfish, etc. &#160;The meals looked very appetizing. &#160;I tried some of the potine, catfish, and mac/cheese. &#160;I would definitely order the mac/cheese in the future. The prices weren't too bad, maybe a little on the expensive side but it's expected since it's next to the Pike Place Market. &#160;Our server, Jeff, did an excellent job. &#160;He was very good with our refills and with making dinner suggestions. &#160;I plan to take my better half here for dinner sometime soon. &#160;I'm sure she'll enjoy a meal here. &#160;If you've never been here before, start off with ordering a sandwich or order something from the starters/appetizer menu. Took my visiting brother there for Sunday lunch and we had a very enjoyable experience. &#160;The menu is terrific, so it was difficult to decide, but we loved our choices (burger for him, vegetable chili for me). &#160;I'll be back to try the other things that sounded so good. A close friend made reservations here for a group of five. &#160;I had never gone here before, and was pleasantly delighted with the food. &#160;Everyone in our party LOVED their meals. &#160;The chantrelle alfredo - YUM. &#160;Fried curds - YUM. &#160;Red beans and rice - YUM. &#160;Gumbo - YUM. &#160;Roasted squash - YUM. &#160;Southern fried chicken - YUM. &#160;I hear that all the ingredients are purchased fresh every day at Pike Place Market. &#160;We all left with our tongues and tummies satisfied.I particularly liked the menu because it offered options in both the moderate and pricier range. &#160;I enjoyed my squash "side dish" for $8 (I had to take half home because the portion was so big). &#160;Entrees ran in the mid-teens to the high twenties.However, the service was... both overbearing and slow on a Saturday evening. &#160;It was packed and loud. &#160;When our server was at the table, she repeatedly suggested $10 cocktails. &#160;And when she wasn't at our table, well... she just wasn't around. &#160;We started dinner at 8 p.m. and didn't leave until 10 p.m. - and only because we kept flagging her down asking for our tab. Great appetizers, good selection of seafood! i had a great time here for lunch with friends. my buttermilk chicken sandwich was very crispy - the way i like it! Prices could be a little less steep but i guess that's why i stuck with a sandwich and not a fish dish. It's got cute decor but b/c of the tall ceiling, conversations echoed and made it a bit noisy - but not a huge distraction. all in all, a great stop along pike place market - tourist worthy. i would definitely come again a few more times.
Best late night Chinese food in the downtown Seattle/Chinatown area.It literally feels like our table gets our food within 5minutes of ordering every time we're here. Mmm mm mm...honey walnut prawns, salt n pepper squid, fish fried rice (hey, it's pretty good!) house special chow mein..I can go on &amp; on.. I love Chinese food! :)A downside though, it's kind of hard to get parking. Esp since it's a popular area for late night Chinese food, plus its street side parking only. And since it's located in China town, there are quite a few of bums/crack heads loitering around :-P make sure to use the buddy system when walking down the street!
Texas Chili at it's FINEST (no beans!! yeah)!! Icy cold beer, Iceberg Salad with REAL bacon, and Buffalo Crawfish Tails!! I am IN LOVE!!! JUST GO!!! If your a beer loving, SH*T TALKING, CHILI LOVER like me!!! You will be in Heaven. I was going to give this 3 stars until I became violently ill after eating here. &#160;I had heard from a friend it was good, but expensive ($10 for a bowl of chili???). &#160;And of course, you can't have too high of expectations for a 'chili shack &amp; watering hole'. &#160;A small group of us went for lunch, and after fighting for a table, then requesting to get it cleared from the previous patrons, waited a good 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us, and then it was "What can I get for you?" in a tired voice. No "Hello" or "Sorry for the wait" or anything. &#160;Wasn't impressed. &#160;From the reviews and the waitresses recommendation, I went for a cup of Chili Verde with "The Works" (sour cream, whole jalepeno, cheese. etc). &#160;Also ordered a 'fresh squeezed limeade' as did others. &#160;My coworker who never complains about anything asked "Does yours taste like dish soap?" Watered down with no refills. &#160;The chili itself was tasty - I liked it. The cornbread with honey butter was good as well, and I liked that it came in a small loaf. &#160;A drink was forgotten, a coworker ordered something to go that was missing the fries (which we found later were sitting on the counter the whole time), the waitress forgot to include the to-go order with the total.And I really could have gone without the bright pink thong sported by one of the waitresses. I didn't expect a lot, but was disappointed in the experience; if the food was great, then you can forgive some of the smaller things. But marginal food with bad service never does it for me. What a great place. I love the chili here and I love the look of the place. The bartenders have always been friendly and one time I saw an awesome, awesome band here (Madraso). I just had a cup of pork chili served over jalapeno macaroni. I was in heaven. That Chopper's Beer is the shit, too. Walked in on a Saturday afternoon and the place was all ours. Not a soul in there, which was shorly changed and stated to fill up by the time we left. I created my own chili cheese fries with the verde chili and pepper jack. Let's just say Awesome. Had a side of Mac N Cheese with jaleponeos which was pretty good. Friends had the Texas red that was really good also. The fries are really good too! I have to say, the beer selection is great (they got what I want), the chili selection (again, they got what I want), and the staff make this place for me.I think my faves are the Turkey and whit bean chili and the Georgetown brewing's Chopper's Red. &#160;Purrrfect combo for me. &#160;Happy our frito pie and sloppy joses are tasty for the $3. &#160;Happy hour here is my friend. &#160;Espsecially in the summer when I can drink my red on the patio out of my FROSTY JAR!AND Thank you, Kat, Claire and Celeste for the ongoing great service! I have eaten at Slim's three times now, and am definitely a fan of the food. &#160;I've tried the Texas Red and the White Bean/Turkey chili. &#160;I also tried the burger, and have to say I thought it was great. &#160;If you want a gourmet kobe burger, go elsewhere, but for a good diner burger this fills the bill. &#160;Fries and mac/cheese were great too.Laughed that when I ordered an Iron City beer, I got a tall boy.A lot of comments about the service - my experiences have been that we got what we ordered, the servers monitored things with us appropriately and I don't think you can ask for more than that. &#160;This isn't the home of the warm and fuzzy, and if you come in expecting that treatment I could see you being disappointed. I LOVE their Texas (no bean) red chili and their pork chile verde -- both "with the works" (onions, cheese, tomatoes, sour cream, and a fire roasted chile which you should try even if you're scared (take small bites to start out) because it adds just the right amount of heat to the overall bowl). All chiles are made daily with fresh ingredients. My husband loves the Kobe (!) beef hot dog with Texas red chili, cheese and onions. The jalepeno mac and cheese is really creamy and has just enough heat. The cornbread with killer honey-butter is also not to be missed. They have a good beer selection. Haven't been there for pool or music but they have both. Service is no nonsense (and possibly could be considered brash if you're sensitive) -- we have found the service to hospitable and attentive each of the 4 times we've been there. It's a 21 and over place -- so no kids allowed. They cater too -- I had them bring in a whole spread for a blues themed party at my office. It was a hit!
Blueberry Bagels and Barbequed PorkSeeking out my favored noodle restaurant in the ID, I arrived to find that my remembrance of their Closed Tuesday policy was inaccurate. The sign on the door read "Closed Monday". I set out in search of a alternative. Prior searches failed miserably, so I'm thinking that this time has to be different. I deemed it appropriate to intentionally seek out the most suspicious looking eatery I could find, and go for it. I walked past "Best Barbeque". Much too clean and extremely popular. The seedy bars didn't fit my criteria, even though they advertised food. I walked several blocks, peering in windows, glancing at menus, but searching for that certain "look" and feel. I spotted it. Across the street. Funky. Faded green store front, elderly awning, several raw chickens hanging in the steamy window. There was a moment of fear. Was this really such a good idea?...Absolutely. I went in. A Chinese woman was speaking on the phone, having quite an animated conversation, which I was totally unable to understand, but it dominated the room. A guy looked at me questioningly. "Yes?", but seeming to say: "Are you sure you're in the right place?" I nodded and he motioned to a large table in the empty restaurant. Another fellow walked up and placed a plastic water glass on the table. I reached for it, realized that in fact it contained hot tea; I knew I was in the right place. The room was essentially quite unattractive: stairs to an upper eating area with balcony, neon red and green paper with the menu written in Chinese hung behind the counter and beside me an elderly fish tank populated with 4 large, lazy creatures who were definitely food rather than decor. &#160;I looked over the menu for something a bit off my typical fare. There it was; Salty Fish and Chicken Fried Rice, $5.95. Perfect. I placed my order to yet another questioning look. "Salty Fish and Chicken Fried Rice??" I nodded approval. Yes, the weird out of place white guy also wanted untypical food. The man who gave me the tea wandered off to the kitchen, as he was in fact the cook. Guy number one wandered hither and yon, occasionally speaking to the woman, who was still on the phone, yet never looking at her. He smiled continuously and occasionally laughed at what she was saying. She, however, never appeared to be even slightly amused.As I waited, a customer came in for a takeout order. He seemed to know the chef and called out: "My wife loves your soup!" This was actually quite encouraging as I had gone through some moments of significant doubt, laughing to myself about regrettable consequences of my quest and meal. Another man came in and guy number one went off to the kitchen returning with what looked like a whole uncooked, smoothly plucked, chicken, hanging over a metal bowl. He chopped it up and put it in a styrofoam "to go" container. This was highly suspicious. Why were they selling what looked like an uncooked chicken? Unfortunately, this question was never answered.I went off to wash my hands just as my fried rice was served. "Do you want a fork?" I shook my head, but he asked again as I returned to my seat, still with that complete grin. It wasn't false or unfriendly, but just seemed out of place. I dug in, and simultaneously, the cook brought out some plates and the three of them sat down near the counter and started to eat. My food was quite tasty with nice little bits of salty fish, scallion, some fried egg and of course, chicken. The scary looking hot sauce turned out to be pretty tasty too. There was a curious cacophony of metallic sounds coming from their table and I looked over to see that they were all using forks! The woman looked up and asked if I really liked salted fish and stated that most Caucasians don't like the smell. I assured her that I thought it was great and I really did enjoy my meal. I finished before they did, and decided to not interrupt them. I relaxed with another glass of tea. &#160;After 10 minutes or so, I walked up to the counter and glanced at their table to see just what they were eating. &#160;A plate of something bright green that looked a lot like lettuce, but shiny, a bowl of barbecued pork and on each of their plates, half a toasted blueberry bagel. I had to look closer. This was not possible. Maybe it was some Chinese bun or exotic pastry. No. It was in fact half a toasted blueberry bagel. I couldn't resist, laughed and said: "C'mon, you're all using forks and eating bagels!" The lady answered that I probably don't eat Chinese food every day, and since they typically do, they liked to switch it up every once in a while. As for the utensils, they explained that it is much easier to use a fork when eating off a plate, as opposed to a rice bowl, when chop sticks are simpler for scooping it up. We had a great little conversation. I informed them that unfortunately I was going to have to turn them in. She laughed and said: "To who?" Well, as it happens to you
Get the Pumpkin curry! Get it! A red curry with Asian squash, peppers and choice of meat. It's full of flavor and my new must have comfort food. Warms you up on a misty Seattle day with a very hearty portion, so the leftovers keep you warm for many more days. Their sweet and sour cucumber sauce and peanut sauce are to die for. I drink any leftovers directly from the ramekin. I know, it's gross, but I refuse to leave any sauces behind. Modern updated interior, attentive and friendly service, reasonable prices, dine-in date night or movie night carry out. Ikea threw up ALL over the interior of this place. Seriously, if every piece of furniture and decoration isn't straight outta Ikea, they managed to find the best Ikea knock-offs in the biz. I'm...flummoxed as to what those may be, for the record.Incidentally, I don't necessarily mean that as a bad thing; it's just an obvious thing. I like the Granny Smith apple color with the black and white, and while it doesn't manage to really be a homey space, it isn't a terrible effect. It just feels a touch sterile.The food is pretty decent, too. Eastlake is a tough 'hood to work in when it comes to lunch places. Even though Siam is a smidge too far away for a normal lunch 1/2 hour, it's worth that occasional long lunch to grab some takeaway.The phad see iew is always good. Actually, I'm pretty sure that it's good enough that I may have never tried anything else here. Huh, shame on me. But kudos to them for keeping me focused on it. It's a sad day for me to give Siam only 2 stars. I have been a Siam regular for, well, about 15 years when the original Siam was on Broadway and E. Roy St. It was fabulous, the Thai restaurant to which all were compared.Then the owners went their separate ways; one owner kept Siam on Broadway, remodeled it, etc. The other owner got Siam on Eastlake which was a good restaurant but we usually only did take out because the building was really weird. Most of the time though we went to Siam on Broadway.After a few more years, Siam on Broadway closed, so Siam on Eastlake was our fall back. Then Siam on Eastlake moved and remodeled a really nice space. I like the bar area more than the rest of the layout.Today I went to Siam for lunch. I believe Pad Thai is the signature dish in which to judge a Thai restaurant. First of all, $8.95 is a little pricey for what it is. I ordered 3 stars, it was not 3 star heat/flavor. But worst of all, it was sticky, gummy, and sweet. Too red, obviously they use ketchup - that's Pad Thai blasphemy.In the "Foodie Handbook" by Pim Techamuanvivit (a great book, by the way), there are only 4 ingredients in Pad Thai sauce: tamarind pulp (sour), fish sauce (salty), palm sugar (sweet) and Thai chili powder (hot).In the "Foodie Handbook" see pages 68-73, and you can make better Pad Thai than Siam!I'm truly disappointed. I have to say I was only lukewarm that last time I was there for dinner with my family. But this lunch cinches the deal. I think I'll have to find a new regular Thai joint. Great atmosphere. Love the modern design and openness, and service was pretty good.Food:-Spicy eggplant: kinda plain and wasn't super spicy even at 4 star.-Tofu green curry: good, but I've had better.-Garlic shrimp: good flavor.-Jungle chicken: nothing special.-Tofu phad see iew: comparable to other places.This might be a good spot if you live or work in the area, but there are much better thai places out there if you're looking for yummy food. I'd give it a thumbs up for atmosphere though. This is our go-to Thai place near our house. We can walk here from our house, or get take out and it is always good. Super clean restaurant and nice staff. Service can be a bit slow, so we like to get our take-out for movie night at home. Our favorites are their noodle dishes and fried rice dishes :) This really isn't a place for me.I like my thai a little less 'disco fabulous' I don't frequent any other places on SLU- unless forced by business lunches like in this case- and this is no exception.The atmosphere is too trendy for me, the person at the door- although apologetic about it- was a bit flustered for only 3 parties walking in at once and the menu was super limited for lunch.I liked the old place, the huge fishtanks, the traincar chic, it was really more for me.It's likely I'll be back but not on my own dime. Came back here again last night for a double date and had a great time!!! The food was still fabulous as ever and I was able to try more dishes this time cause we shared everything family style.We shared the phad thai, swimming rama, jungle chicken and the basil fried rice. For some odd reason, the swimming rama was the tiniest portion and it didn't come with rice either!!! Boo... but it's okay because everything else was filling enough that it worked out perfectly.The jungle chicken still tasted amazing, love the crunchiness of the fried stuff. The basil fried rice looked unappetizing but was actually super tasty and the phad thai looked really red instead of orange but that tasted AMAZING too! They also gave lots of bean sprouts too! Woohoo. They were really good about refilling our waters too, that's super important to me. The swimming rama was alright but overall, I was so full at the end and a really happy camper. Thai food remains no. 1 on my list of cuisine, not counting my "mother" food of course. I tried the new location and I was impressed. My family has always been a big fan of Siam on Eastlake and we were even more pleasant at our last dining experience with the restaurant's new look. The food is still very delicious! I am totally into the whole idea of authentic food being presented in a service-friendly and attractive package. And I'd say Siam made a great move to this brand new place... will definitely come back soon. Great meal, prompt service and reasonable prices (for Seattle). Tom ka soup was more of a coconut milk flavor than curry-type flavor but wasn't bad. Pad Thai was orange colored and did taste like it might have ketchup in it but my husband liked it. &#160;I got the drunken noodle and it was very good. You can be liberal on the spicy chart. &#160;I ordered a 2 out of 4 and it didn't have much kick at all. Overall a good meal and we'd g back. Oh and atmosphere was nice and trendy- not what you expect at your typical thai restaurant. My poor husband always develops this nasty case of diarrhea after eating here. Not me. I don't know what it is. I actually like their food, except Phad Thai...it's really subpar. But phad see ew and other stuff such as basil thai, imperial noodle, fried rice, etc. are tasty. Their bar area is perfect for watching games.I am just bitter that I am banned from eating here. Three diarrhea and you're out. It could be that grumpy looking cook always smoking cigarette by the back door on Eastlake Ave... Can I say YUM? I'm a big fan of Thai food, and absolutely love the newly-revamped Siam on Eastlake. On top of the trendy decor, which i love, I have a few favorite dishes that I'm going to share...I absolutely adore, maybe obsess over, their Jungle Chicken dish! I've had it multiple times and each time I leave feeling satisfied with my entree decision. The Jungle Chicken dish is essentially a platter of perfectly crispy chicken pieces, sauteed with pineapple, bell peppers, and fried basil leaves. This is all topped with the most delicious sweet and spicy sauce ever.The Chicken Pad Thai and Chicken Fried Rice are also really good. So are the fried spring rolls. You probably can't tell from my review, but i typically don't eat much chicken or meat, but for Siam? Absolutely!Also just discovered their amazing HH deals after 9pm. They have a great selection of apps and entrees for $5-$7 each.Definitely try this if you're craving Thai food, and order the Jungle Chicken. You won't regret it! :) The old Siam was more homey than their new location and it seemed like they were having an identity crisis when they opened up the new one - so modern, and no more fish tanks. That said, the quality of food is good and they do have what appears to be more space now. Their hosts are still spotty but their waiters have always been very courteous. The lunch prices are reasonable and I always enjoy my garden delight. It's not a bad Thai place at all. I'm just thankful there is at least one Thai place in the neighborhood. Just isn't the same since they moved. &#160;New place does have good design, but it's not the same. &#160;Also great for take out. Nice, modern, stylish decor, efficient, friendly, service &amp; beautifully presented, tasty Thai food, but I didn't see Pud Kee Mao on the menu. I used to order green curry at the old place.I visited this new location recently which is only a block away from the old one.It becomes a better restaurant with a more contempory decor.The smart design is great with the bar right in front of the entrance so people can have a drink while waiting for take outs. There is a banquet room in the back area.They have a long street frontage with window dinning which makes it nice for its exposure.I ordered the Pumkin Red Curry with prawn at the bar to try it out the first time and I liked it very much, especially with brown rice that comes with it (they used to charge for it at the old place, so it means the value is better !?)I finished the entire dish that comes in a big square bowl even with the creamy gravy and felt perfectly satisfied seeing all the customers also enjoyed themselves.Clean, with good food, and attentive bartender, close in location, prices are fair in the menu, do &#160;worth a 5.WIll definitely go back to patron it again. I went to the old Siams, and in terms of the decor, it wasn't half as nice as what it is now. &#160;The new Siams has a realy nice modern feel to it. &#160;It was sorta weird how the the restroom area had a shared hand washing area for the men and women, but I guess that's the least bit of my worries.I ended up coming here with a group of people close to 25-30 people. The party host made reservation about a week in advance so that we could all fit in. &#160;We sat in a big box formation, There was nothing in the middle. &#160;I was pretty impressed about how they were able to manage the food orders and still provide good service. &#160;I ended up getting the Chicken Phad Thai which was tasty. &#160;I don't think think this was the best Thai food that I have ever had, but I would come back by myself if I was craving Thai food and if I was nearby. Good service and a classy atmosphere. Respectable amount of vegetarian options (I recommend getting Pad See Ew with vegetables or the Lake Union Garden). Slightly pricey drinks, but I've never been here for happy hour so maybe it's better then. Starters are a little boring and the peanut sauce wasnt great, but everything was fresh and the entrees havent disappointed. Parking is easy on the street.A lot like every other Thai place, but maybe a little classier and grown up. I've been going here for years and I enjoy eating here even more in the new location. It is a gorgeous environment, the food is fabulous and the staff friendly and professional. I recommend it to all my friends. The $5 fresh squeezed on a press greyhounds on happy hour make me a very very happy person =) The bartenders have always been friendly and provide average-better then average service depending on how busy they get. All of their currys are very very good, and I've found the spices to be very consistant and accurate down to the star! DO NOT order the phad thai if this is one of your favorite dishes at another thai place..Siam will not compare with their ketchup like mixture. Stick with the curry and you won't be dissapointed! The spring rolls are average, green beans are actually very good, and the atmosphere is fantastic with its lighting, and very social but not crazy loud crowd. Good viewing in the bar as well if your looking to catch a game. If you have ever read any of my reviews, you know that mama is constantly looking for the perfect Thai restaurant experience. &#160;Siam comes pretty darn close in my book.The tom kha gai (gai means "chicken") soup was definitely the best I have ever had; could've used a few more pieces of chicken, but the flavor and spices were outstanding. &#160;Heads up: &#160;Even a small is pretty large, so keep that in mind as you're ordering.I also had the panang curry with chicken and ordered sticky rice -- appreciated that they had regular sticky rice as well as the mango sweet kind, which is really more of a dessert. &#160;The flavor of the curry was outstanding; I don't eat bell peppers, so when you need to have a thai dish without that, you often get a plethora of some other vegetable -- in this case, it was onions. &#160;It didn't affect the flavor of the curry, but wish there were another vegetable to replace the peppers that could be used.The decor was very trendy and fun; the staff nice and available without rushing me through my meal. The music was phenomenal -- and, for once, at the right volume so you could actually enjoy it as well as have a conservation with other people or read (as I did -- I was dining solo that night). &#160;I highly recommend this place and would definitely come back next time I'm in Seattle!
This isn't a huge space so imagine my surprise when I walked in with 11 other people and they offered to seat up all together within 15 minutes. We really thought we'd just be split up into 2 groups of 6 or 3 groups of 4 and we were totally fine with that. But, the manager working the night we stepped in was so kind and she made it work so that our group of friends that had travelled from all over the US could sit together and we really appreciated it.We also appreciated the fact that we had such great service and our food came out so quickly considering how many of us were there. And I personally appreciated how they worked with me on menu changes, swapping out steak for chicken on a salad even though it really wasn't an option for me.If I had to recommend one thing for you to eat here I'd probably pick the fish tacos though. That's what Nick got and I kept stealing bite after bite from his plate because they were quite good! Came in here last night with some friends. &#160;Sat on the deck which was nice. &#160;All ordered a round of drinks from our server Nanda or Nanya I couldn't quite remember or hear her name, but she was friendly and gorgeous and that's all that matters. &#160;We asked about happy hour menu's since it was almost 10. &#160;Their happy hour menu was quite large I was impressed with all of the options, and the prices weren't bad either. &#160;I had the classic mac &amp; cheese and a caesar salad both YUM. &#160;Couple of friends had the tacos, one a burger, and one coco prawns. &#160;This was my first time on the deck. &#160;The late night happy hour seems to be where it's at because regular happy hour is always packed and I'm forced to sit at the bar on sunny days which makes me sad.Service was on point even when our server was switched out. &#160;I did kind of feel like we were being rushed to leave once we were the only people left on the deck, but we were ready to go anyway so not a big deal. I've been to Eastlake Bar &amp; Grill numerous times, but I'd only been for lunch until this weekend. Turns out, they have quite the extensive brunch menu.I came here with a few friends and none of us could decide what to order. Too many things sounded good! We all ended up drinking mimosas, which were delightful. I finally decided on the California breakfast sandwich: as ciabatta roll with a fried egg, avocado, cheese, &amp; pesto mayo. SO good. I loved the potatoes on the side, too. My friend ordered a cheese &amp; mushroom omelette and her boyfriend had the breakfast tacos and they were both very happy with their orders. We also loved being able to sit on the patio and enjoy the sunshine. It was a perfect choice for brunch! This place screams mediocrity with a beautiful view: an overpriced menu full of frozen crap, slow service, decor that reminds you of something coming out of the 70's and a nice balcony with a view of Lake Union while you enjoy aforementioned features.The menu is a head scratcher to say the least. &#160; Chock full of greasy affair of deep fried sandwiches and an abundance of burgers, along with frozen "bottomless" fries that remind you of something coming out of a drive thru. &#160;They buy these in by the droves. &#160;My sliders didn't have anything unique at all: bbq slider, bleu cheese slider. &#160;It makes me sick just thinking about the possibility of the sauces on these burgers being processed and bought in. &#160;I bet my money they were. &#160;The prices are abnormally high considering such frozen crap. &#160;I'd be willing to pay higher prices if the menu was edible, fresh and unique.Our server was incredibly inattentive and lazy. &#160;We had to flag her down twice just to put in a few simple requests, as long minutes had gone by since she seldomly checked up on us.The decor is sorely outdated and appears to be something out of the 70's. &#160;Think an old, popcorn ceiling apartment with that smell of old wood and furniture. &#160;It's an eye sore.If you want good food, fresh food made with care without the hoopla of the view of the lake, head down to Louisa's Cafe half a mile south. &#160;You can thank me later. Eastlake Bar &amp; Grill, or "EBG" as our friends call it, is one of our regular hangouts.Tastes: The food is okay, nothing special, but nothing offensive. The hummus appetizer is really good and pretty big. Stay away from the chicken artichoke dip which was delivered to our table by accident one time that we ordered hummus. Burgers and wraps are pretty safe and standard. View: The patio is amazing. Lots of seating and an amazing view of Lake Union. On a sunny day, this is our go-to place. Fun: On Monday nights, they have trivia which is really fun. Not too serious (no rigid rule followers) but fun questions and good prizes. Each week the theme for the next week's trivia is set so you have an advantage if you go regularly. It's also kid and baby-friendly which has been great for some of our friends, as other great patios in the area (Joey's) are 21+. Prices: EBG has very reasonable prices and lots of specials throughout the week. If you have a prime/passport card, it's a total steal! This is absolutely our default sunny day hangout, and we're lucky to live so close by! I would only suggest Eastlake Bar &amp; Grill for Happy Hour, which is everyday from 3-6 or 9-close. &#160;There isn't anything too unique on their menu, besides the fact that everything is reasonably cheap for your buck. &#160;I'm a fan of the Chicken Sandwich for $5.99 and it comes with fries. &#160;I noticed some new items that looked tasty to me such as the Habanero Mac &amp; Cheese--I'll definitely try that next time!Link to their menu: http://www.neighborhoodg&#8230;.They have drink specials of wells, wine, beer and cocktails, which I definitely appreciate as I like have options. The Neighborhood Punch tastes like Hawaiian Punch to me :)Service has always been very friendly and personable. &#160;We did have a problem with slow-service and no one filling our waters the last time here. :/ &#160;Eastlake does have an two outside decks with a beautiful view of Lake Union! This more like 3.5 stars. The patio, of course, is awesome and is the reason for the additional points. &#160;Been here a few times as its right down the streety from my apartment and the happy is the only time to come. Otherwise, the food is overly expensive. $13 for a cheeseburger and another $3.50 if you want to sub a little salad instead of fries? C'mon... &#160;Its still a bar. I come here so much that it's become a running joke among my friends. What can I say? The happy hour rocks, the waterfront deck has one of the best views in town, and it's within walking distance of my house in case I drink too many double margaritas.Loves: The deck on a nice day. Two happy hours every day. Cheerful, familiar servers. The cookie sundae. The California breakfast sandwich. Flavored mayo (I know, I'm disgusting, but chipotle seasoning wins me over every time). Rarely a wait for an inside table.Not so loves: The non-happy hour prices. The food here's good, but it's not THAT good. A salad should never cost more than 10 bucks, and if it does, it should be phenomenal. I work really near here so we often come to lunch here. NEVER again though! I always hate it, every time I go. We've never been able to make it out of there in less than an hour 45 because of the slooooow slow service. And every time at least one of us has something wrong with our order. The last time I went I called ahead for a to-go order and they said it would be ready in 15 minutes. So I show up in 15 minutes and ended up waiting there another 35 minutes. For one salad (not a special order). While I waited I was asked 3 times by 2 people if I needed seating, I said no and that I was waiting for a to-go order. On the third time someone asked the man (who was there before I was!) if he was waiting for seating. He said yes and was not very happy that he had been ignored when I wasnt. I dont blame him! I guess in summary -- mediocre food, pricey for what you get, and terrible service. I was here on a sunny Sunday with a large party of ~20 people. &#160;I ordered the Fish Tacos and they were tasty, but perhaps a tad spendy at approximately $13.-1 star for the service. &#160;The staff was generally attentive, but they missed the order for one of our party and she ended up eating her meal well after the others.In general it's a great location on a sunny day given the view over Lake Union. Um, yeah, $12.99 for a burger that is charred to a crisp? I'm not usually a brat about my food but come on. I know they can do better than that. I'll hope that my visit today was just a fluke. Normally I really enjoy my burger here - the western one has yummy BBQ sauce and onion rings. My only problem with this place is the price. They could really take off about $2 per entree based on the quality of the food, which is pretty much average. The bar isn't bad and the times I've been for happy hour, it seems to be pretty good. But compared to the other eateries on Eastlake this is just...average. I do love that they have a decent sized parking lot here, definitely convenient for lunchtime when I have a strict time limit to adhere to. Inside bar experience has been "just OK", however the outside deck area experience has always been A+++ I like the myriad of food choices, including vegetarian and healthier options. Beer selection is great and happy hour prices are awesome. Bonus points for this place because they are on Tippr AND in the Entertainment book. I have never been hassled about using coupons here and they have always given me the full reimbursement amount (but don't forget: Tip your server on the original amount!). The tiki bar on the deck, during the warm months, is a fun place to hang out around with the frosty mugs o' beer and the music playing. The view of Lake Union is really fantastic.Parking can be a bit of a pain... the lot is small, so keep an eye out for spots on the street. Great Happy hour specials and nice views from the outdoor patio! I'm a huge mac and cheese lover. &#160;They offer two types of mac and cheese on the happy hour menu. &#160;I ordered the special $6.99 mac and cheese + $2 for the steak with bleu cheese and steak. &#160;However, when my food arrived to the table it was mac ad cheese with chicken and bacon. &#160;The manager gave me the wrong order. I was really hungry and really didn't care what mac and cheese I rec'd so I ate it. &#160;The waitress came by to check on us and immediately noticed that I had the wrong order. &#160;She offered to bring out the correct plate however, I had already started eating...so I told her not to worry about it. &#160;Overall, the meal was just OK. The chicken was a little dry and flavorless. I am curious about the mac and bleu cheese so maybe I'll order that the next time. At the end of the meal the waitress felt bad for &#160;the mix up with my order and comped my meal. &#160;I was really impressed with their customer service. &#160;I look forward to trying out other items on the menu. Also, this place has a parking lot which is nice. &#160;You don't have to worry about trying to find a spot on the street. Updating: Still impressed with their breakfasts on the weekends but wish they'd do the same during the week days as they don't open the doors until 11 or so.. &#160;:(Prices seem to be rising everywhere and here it's not any different. Good choice for a sandwich the Greenlake Chicken Club and The Reuben, YUMMY.Pros: decent breakfasts and lunch items. Nice patio, decent service depending on which server you get. Good prices. Haven't had dinner there so can't comment on that. A great full bar and nice to have mimosas with your sunday breakfast.Cons: Should open earlier on weekdays - us telecommuters would appreciate not having to wait til 11 AM! &#160;(Please open earlier...) Service at times can be spotty with one or two of the servers but the others were fine.. Stay away from the so-called "Wedge salad".... they don't use a good blue cheese or roquefort dressing. Instead it's some kind of semi creamy vinegary concoction that totally blows the whole concept and ends up "souring" the rest of the salad especially if you add chicken with it.(they didn't offer steak). I ended up sending mine back. It wasplain gross. I've only been here for happy hour. &#160;The food is average to a little above average. &#160;There are dishes that I like but don't blow me away, and then there are dishes that are kind of meh, but I will eat anyway. &#160;What makes me go to this happy hour is the price of drinks. &#160;Make it a double for $2! &#160;There's also a deck overlooking Lake Union, and this is one of the rare happy hours where you can bring your kids. &#160;Because there's no sense in getting sloshed if you can't bring the whole family.One tip - The parking situation gets bad fast, so get there early. came here with a few buddys the other night. It is a pretty cool spot to gave some drinks and munch on some food. great view of the water. wait staff was super nice and friendly. It's a standard diner with a great view and casual atmosphere. &#160;If you're looking for an "American" meal with a view Lake Union, then I recommend this joint. I went to Eastlake Bar &amp; Grill for happy hour the other day to catch up with a friend. One of the reasons I chose this place is because they have a parking lot. &#160;It was a beautiful day outside, so sitting on their deck was perfect. &#160;Great weather and a beautiful view. &#160;The food was a little pricy for happy hour so I started off with a Bud Light to keep my drink cheap ($3). &#160;Then I decided to go for the Coco Prawns. &#160;They were a little more fried than expected, but still tasty. &#160;It came with a small bed of rice that was a nice addition. &#160;My friend got the chop chop salad (which I wish I had ordered after seeing hers) and she said it was really good. &#160;Overall, I thought the service was great and would definitely return here on a sunny day for their outdoor seating, but may not return to happy hour to sit inside. There wasn't anything that particularly stood out to me. I came here with a couple friends for happy hour - we had to wait like 20 minutes for a table, and the service was just reasonable. The food and wine was fine, but the waterfront patio on a beautiful day was probably the most attractive part. Haven't been here in a few months and I guess they added something to the HH menu-- Mediterranean wrap and it was delicious... Or was I just really hungry at 10:30? LOL. Had the okra beef soup and that was bomb too! this is definitely one of my favorite places especially if my best friend lives in one of those apartments across the street ;) My family and I visit Eastlake Bar and Grill on a semi-frequent basis. &#160;The dining experience is usually good to great, providing tasty food and a cheerful staff.Not so much last night.My husband and I stopped by at 9:40 pm for drinks and a late dinner. &#160;After ordering drinks, we decided on the recommendation of the waiter, to wait 20 minutes until happy hour meals started up at 10 pm. &#160;That might have been a mistake.We waited until 10:18 before the waiter returned to take our orders and only after I threw myself at one of the waitresses. &#160;My husband ordered a Caesar and cheeseburger. &#160;I order the chopped salad without turkey. &#160; &#160;Ten minutes later the food showed up. &#160;The burger was passable (wilted lettuce, pretty dry), the Caesar didn't taste like a Caesar at all. &#160;In their defense, the only restaurant around that makes a good Caesar is the Metropolitan Grill. &#160;Anchovies seem to have disappeared entirely from the recipe everywhere else. &#160;Even the 13 Coins quit making a real Caesar. &#160;My salad was "ok". &#160;After eating a little less than half, I stopped and pulled a long hair out of my mouth that was definitely not mine. &#160;The waiter stopped by ten minutes later to ask how things were going. &#160;I let him know about the hair and he whisked the plate away. &#160;The hair was bad enough but my gripe is really with the lack of service and bland food served up. &#160;(The IPA was wonderful.) &#160;I was still hungry and wanted to order something else but it was like pulling teeth to get a waiter. &#160;We gave up and flagged a waitress down at 11:00 and asked for the bill. &#160; Perhaps they were shy a wait person, or maybe they had way more customers show up than normally. &#160;This doesn't explain the bland food. &#160;I probably won't be back for a while. &#160;Eastlake is getting some great restaurants, Ravish being my favorite, and we're not limited to Eastlake B&amp;G so why eat there if we're not getting good service. Went here a week or so ago, weather was amazing. Was here with a few friends for steak night. My friend ordered a beverage and it had a ant floating in it. Waiter apologized and got another one, said he looked no bugs. We looked a little harder and another ant...seriously? He apologized again, this time she asked for water. I was assuming the waiter was going to take care of us maybe comp us or something nice for the fact that back to back her drink had a bug in it. In the end nothing...it was very disappointing. I understand that they get busy but when you have something like that happen you take care of the customer so they come back. Service was an epic fail that night. Nothing too fancy, fabulous or unique. The service is always friendly, the food is fresh and there's something on the menu for mostly everyone. It feels like a frat party at times, but Eastlake Bar &amp; Grill is there when you need it. Definitely the better of the neighborhood bar &amp; grill bunch. I've been here several times for HH, brunch, and dinner. &#160;The food is only "ok" but they can have some good drink specials and really, you can't beat the view, which is the best reason to come. &#160;So if you want a beer on the deck (and are willing to fight for a seat) on a nice summer day this is a great place. &#160;If you want a beer and some super amazing bar food to go with it, keep looking.Wait times can be rough for the patio on sunny days and/or weekends, but they also open a 'Tiki Bar' area on the deck in the summer which is open seating. &#160;If you don't get a spot on the deck, the views are still great from the inside windows as well. Best coconut prawns in town! &#160;Good house margaritas too... My burger was really good. My girlfriends Mahi Mahi Taco was a waste of 17 bucks. Their red meat dishes are definitely worth going for. Our waitress was horrible and I hope I don't get her next time. Her tan was hella vicious. Nothing too out of the ordinary but it does have a wonderful view off the deck or rooftop. Looking out over the water at happy hour enjoying some delicious cocktails and watching the sunset was great. The salmon burgers that my friends orders looked very, very good as too. What a great spot! Especially on a day where you can sit outside on their huge patio over looking Lake Union/Gas Works Park. They have a wide variety of food on the menu which is nice, something for everyone - even on the late night HH menu. I was impressed! A lot of cocktail options and great selection of food. Service was up to par, which is important to me. So i'll be back :) This place rates no stars, but had to include one for the review to post. Slooooow service, forgetful waiter, awful bloody mary. &#160;View? well yes if you can ignore the industrial rooftops between the deck and the water. The food is blah. Mimosa, more juice than champagne. With so many poor ratings/reviews, they should get their act together or shut down. I don't understand why this place is always full of people. The only thing it has going for it is the large patio overlooking the lake in the summer. The food was OK, drinks and service were good. Nice place to sit outside and have a drink and snack on something. The food is consistently mediocre and the service consistently crappy. &#160;The only thing this place has going for it is the great view, unbeatable on a nice sunny day, and the good happy hour. We had really bad service here. &#160;It started of great...the waitress took our order, brought us drinks, and out came our food. :o) &#160;Then, service became non existent. &#160;No water refill, no 2nd round of drinks, and the check took almost 15 mins to get back to our table. &#160; &#160;On the plus side, the food was decent. Good happy hour. Decent beer selection. &#160;I get heartburn thinking of eating at the Eastlake B&amp;G. &#160;I give it 3 stars... It would get 4 or even 5 stars in the deep fried category. Expensive mediocre bar food. &#160;Got a burger and it was the cheap diner thin frozen variety - hardly worth $13. &#160;Ad to that $6 beers, slightly above normal for Seattle pub type bars.... &#160;Pretty pricey for the quality and atmosphere. Pretty standard place. The view is great, and the atmosphere is great- comfortable and nice. The food was what really lowered their score here. Overpriced and bland food combined with a lack of freshness really disappointed me. The drinks were okay but nothing better than any typical bar. I was going to write a review, than I realized someone else already summed it up: "This place screams mediocrity with a beautiful view: an overpriced menu full of frozen crap, slow service, decor that reminds you of something coming out of the 70's and a nice balcony with a view of Lake Union while you enjoy aforementioned features." ended up trying this place because i was on the quest for a good happy hour for food and looked like this place had a decent section. everything from basic appetizers, to burgers and fries, or even mac and cheese - all on happy hour for under like $6.
This popular waterfront restaurant resembles the glamorously sedate dining room of a luxury liner, with floor-to-ceiling windows providing panoramic views of the city, the mountains, and the bay, an open kitchen with a charcoal broiler, and a pianist whose discreet playing enhances rather than imposes upon your meal. Not surprisingly, the focus is on seafood, and one of your best choices from the extensive - and expensive - menu well may be a filet of fish, simply grilled and served with a choice of sun-dried tomato beurre blanc, orange fig relish, herbed butter, or a fiery-hot pineapple chutney, although a Thai-inspired seafood stew in lemongrass-coconut broth is an excellent option, as well. Start with a Caesar salad, expertly prepared tableside by very attentive servers, or selections from the fresh shellfish bar. While there's no dress code imposed, the atmosphere and tuxedoed staff are elegant enough to suggest it might be a good idea to leave the jeans and sneakers at home. Very pricey, but worth it as an occasional treat or if you're an out-of-towner looking for one very special dinner. By no means cheap, but if you want to impress a client or close loved one (i.e., your spouse, or in-laws) this is one of the best places in town. If there were more stars to give, I would. Share the seafood combo (for two), you'll think you've died and gone to crustacean Heaven. Honest.
I thought about not reviewing Cocina Esperanza &#160;This is because you're going to come here, find it to be as wonderful as I did and tell all your friends. &#160;Then there will be this line around the corner and I will have to wait in it. &#160;This isn't your typical Mexican restaurant. &#160;You will not find 45 variations of a tortilla, meat, cheese, beans and rice that you find most elsewhere. &#160;Don't get me wrong, that is delicious also but sometimes gets a little too "gut buster". &#160;Plus, located back in this neighborhood I really like to support the local establishments.The food was excellent. &#160;The staff was friendly and attentive. &#160;My glass was always full. &#160;We actually enjoyed our meal so much we considered going back the next day. &#160; &#160;We had the carne asada tacos and an order of enchiladas. &#160;Everything was delicious and fresh. &#160;It might sound funny but I was really impressed with the beans. &#160;I have never had beans that tasty. Not only will I go back, I can't wait to go back. Its great and the menu is all quite good, fresh and homemade but the main downside is not much change in the menu - few and the same specials. The food and sangria are excellent. Anything they make with their green chile sauce on it is wonderful. Great enchiladas, the tostadas, and that thing I can't pronounce meza-something that's like a layer cake of amazing flavor (that's the thing to try). There is definitely an advantage to dining early there as there are few tables, no reservations and it fills up fast. If you have kids, please be mindful that in the small confines of the restaurant voices carry and your kid's squeals can amplify. Very kid friendly and wonderful food. I give it 4 stars because It seems sometimes the restaurant is open during there posted business hours and sometimes it's not. Other than that - we love this place. "Delicious sangria, amazingly tender great chicken mole, nice service... A great find and nice change of pace from our usual Mexican places!
Om nom nom. Not the best I've ever had, but it sure was easy to eat! Our waitress was sort of a bitch, it seemed like she was having a bad day. We went around 7pm on a weeknight and it was REALLY loud. Been here a couple of times. &#160;The pizza is fine, probably better than most local places. &#160;The beer selection is nice. &#160;The location and decor is great.However, this place has a couple of problems, probably due to poor management. &#160;First off, as others have pointed out, the servers can be kind of jerky-- like "I hate my job" jerky.Second, forget the booths near the door in the cooler weather. &#160;They are freezing cold. &#160;This is based on a number of visits. &#160;A better door-closer mechanism would solve most of this.Third, the place is insufferably loud. &#160;On a weekday early evening, we were sitting in a booth and could barely hold a conversation. &#160;The noise wasn't from audio system or the smallish crowd of customers. &#160;It was from the kitchen. &#160;The whole meal I kept thinking "Why isn't someone doing something about that guy slamming pans and dishes around all night?" &#160;Then I guessed he probably had headphones on, and as we were leaving, I peeked thru the window, and sure enough, the guy was wearing headphones, totally oblivious to the ear-bleeding racket he was causing to those on the other side of the wall.Really good food, nice space, but the staff needs some better management. I'd heard good things about Belltown Pizza and desperately wanted it to be a 5, but alas, it was pretty ordinary. Nothing wrong with it, but I tried a few different combinations and all of them were just fine. I would dine here again, but wouldn't make it a top recommended pizza place for my friends. I came here on a Saturday night when I was hungry enough to choose the first place that would seat us. After trying a couple restaurants in the area, we chose this place because they were able to seat us immediately. The fact that they weren't overly crowded should not be a sign that the food wasn't good! I really enjoyed the pizza here. We ordered the "House" pizza which is a fresh garlic, roma tomato and feta cheese pizza. The feta cheese was really nice and not overpowering. The pizza had a thin crust which wasn't so thin that the toppings made the crust soggy. That's no fun. Overall, a very satisfying pizza. I definitely want to come back and try their other specialty pizzas which sounded delicious. This joing is fine for grabbing a slice and a couple beers, but just know that the pizza is pretty weak. Also, service, the check, and even drinks take alot longer than they should. I used to kick it in Belltown quite a bit after I turned 21, so I've stopped in here many times. I've managed to try most of what they offer by slice, and I have to say it was never really that good. They usually don't have nearly enough variety of pizzas to choose from, so you end up waiting for them to make ones with different toppings or just churn out new ones so you get a hot, fresh slice.Thinking back, I don't really know why we went back--I guess just because it happened to be convenient and cheap. I've tried pizza at multiple places in Seattle, and Belltown is one of the best places to go grab a slice of pie! *Top Pizza Restaurants* in Seattle (not listed in any order): 1.) Belltown Pizza 2.) La Vita E Bella 3.) Serious Pie 4.) Via Tribunali I recommend the Carol's Pie! They don't deliver however you can call in advance to place an order. Their prices are what you would expect for pizza, about the same as a Dominos, but 100 times better! They have some booths to sit at, as well as a bunch of tables and a bar. The restaurant is artsy, they even have an old fashioned bike hanging above the bar. There are a few flat screen TVs which is cool if you are someone who likes to watch the game or feels like hanging out there late at night. I'm pretty sure they open later in the day, but the awesome thing is, they are open until 1:30 or 2:00am! After a certain time the restaurant closes, and in the late evenings, you need to be 21+ to go inside because it turns into a bar and only serves pizza by the slice. In the summer it's fun because you can sit outside as well. They do serve salads- for those of you who are watching your figure and dating someone who loves pizza, so it's a good comprimise. Definitely try it out! I can guarantee it will be on your list of top pizza places in Seattle! It's better than Zeeks and Pagliaccis! I just moved to Seattle from NYC, and was very happy. Great Specials for pizza lovers. $20 Tuesdays includes a large pizza and a bucket of 4 beers(Sessions). $25 Wednesdays offers a large pizza with a bottle of wine. It is the best pizza I have had in Seattle so far. &#160;Please yelp me a better one if you know it.Great NYC style pizza, tasty crust, outdoor seating in a funky atmosphere. &#160;Always great table and bar service and the price is right. &#160;This rating would have been four stars but they serve Fernet Branca . . so . . . Traditional New York style pizza. &#160;DELICIOUS! &#160;However, their friendly service and good mix of music is what keeps me going back. &#160;Its my fail safe. &#160;If you can't decide on anywhere to go, go here! &#160;Can't go wrong!By the way, they have a great pizza and beer special on Tuesday night. &#160;Go check it out for your self. I was once denied entry to Belltown Pizza for asking the door guy if I could pet his beard. But that's neither here nor there.This review is for one thing on the meny: CHEESY BREAD! One could call it "clumsy" or "basic" or "low-brow" - however, I call it DELICIOUS. Is there crack in that red sauce, or is it just 4 pounds of garlic? I don't know. But when I've had a couple adult beverages, this stuff is wonderous. Pizza was average -- got the bbq chicken and josh's favorite -- Make sure you get the cheese/garlic bread, it has got to be the best in Seattle! i got a slice of the pepp and the hawaiian last night. &#160;missed happy hr, so i got a guinness. &#160;the bartender poured it right! &#160;he poured it partially full, then finished it off a few min later after it sat. &#160;when i got it, my buddy told me to check out the design on top and i was pleasantly shocked to find he somehow drew the i-love-you hand gesture into the head of the beer!! &#160;very cool... I just moved into the neighborhood (2 blocks away), and I have been looking to find my signature pizza joint. This was my first visit to Belltown pizza, and I have heard some good things, but I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The pizza was good, but not the same caliber of Pagliacci's or many other pizza joints in Seattle. I am normally not hard to please if people are friendly, etc. I noticed a few other comments about the people working there having bad attitudes, etc, and that was honestly my first impression of the place. The man behind the bar that greeted me did not smile, and barely even acknowledged me. &#160;One girl was quite friendly, but the general atmosphere was kind of dark and unfriendly. Unfortunately, this will most likely be the first and last visit to Belltown Pizza. The next time somebody tells me Belltown pizza is good or asks me about it, I will most likely give them the answer above. One of the many reason I am sad I left Seattle is that I can't walk down the street and get a fine slice of pizza from Belltown Pizza. I don't know what the other people are thinking when they say the pizza is just ok, this pizza is the best pizza I've ever had. If you are a thin crust/NY style pizza lover, you will absolutely love this place.During the winter months there is trivia night on Monday, and that is very fun as well. Happy hour prices are 2 bucks a slice and cheap beer as well. I know that when I make my return trip/vacation to Seattle, Belltown Pizza will be one of the first places I go. Seriously good pizza and they are open late.After a raucous evening at Cyclops, we ran across the street for some pizza, not expecting it to be THAT great. We were pleasantly surprised - delicious!Also, they don't mind if you and your friends sing Neil Diamond late into the night. Belltown Pizza has the best Tuesday night special. &#160;A bucket of 4 Session beers, and a 2 topping pizza for $20! Always a great Tuesday night out, and we don't usually have to wait for a table. Staff is friendly and service is pretty fast, as long as they're not slammed. Only giving it 4 or 4.5 stars because although its really good NY style pizza, its not the best I've ever had. I have gone here a few times for their happy hour from 4-6. For $5 I got a slice of pizza and a beer, and I was quite satisfied, I returned again later that week with a friend and we each got a slice of pizza he had one beer and 2 mixed drinks, and I had 3 beers and our total was less than $20! Good drinks, decent pizza, excellent prices. I had a plain pizza of pizza here, and thought it was okay. The staff guy behind the counter was okay, seemed like he had been working long hours. &#160;If you're by there, try it out.
I just moved to the neighborhood and I've now been to Irwin's a couple times for a study session or two. The place definitely has a good feel to it - it's spacious, smells delicious, and they have a self-serve drip coffee bar. The coffee seemed a little overpriced to me compared to other shops in the area, but the space is really conducive to productivity.I haven't tried their food yet, but it looks/smells delicious! Also, it's open until 8 which is later than most local coffee shops. Ohmygodscones! Big ones, with real pieces of giant fruit and nuts folded right in. My favorite is the apple-pecan, though the marionberry is a close second, and the orange-cranberry-walnut isn't turn-down-able. Expensive, though--I think they charge something like $3.50 for one, which is probably the most I've ever paid for one pastry. Keeps me from coming everyday, which is a good and bad thing.I have only gotten drip coffee to drink (because who can afford a scone AND a fancy coffee?). They brew a mighty strong cup of Stumptown, that's for sure. They do offer for-here mugs, which is great because the space is so nice that you'll want to hang out for a while. Bring your laptop and take advantage of the free wi-fi! Ever since I started grad school I have been living at Irwins at least once a week for multiple hours. &#160;The atmosphere is great for studying and the baristas have never once made me feel unwelcome even after I am there for 4 hours! &#160;Their coffee is good, nothing amazing, but good. &#160;Their chocolate chip cookies are delicious! Buy one immediately. &#160;The only negative is that they only serve sandwiches and they are a little pricey considering they don't come with a side and it's a coffee shop, not a restaurant.Overall, awesome ambiance. &#160;A little expensive, but totally worth it if you are planning on staying there for a long time. &#160;They also have free internet which is also kind of worth the price. Went to Irwin's today. It's my first time in it even though I only live a few blocks away. Not very busy but a nice quiet place to study. They have a better selection of drinks than most places around the area which is good for people who may not want coffee or tea. I ordered a Caramel Cider as its the season for warm cider and it was delicious. Staff were very friendly and there is free wifi
I'm a mixed-bag about Eva. We stopped here with some friends the other night at the recommendation of one of our neighbors who raved about the food. First off, we called ahead to see if we could get a reservation and were told there was room in the bar. Great, we'll be there in a few -- and they even saved us a table, nice touch.Then we arrive and said we called ahead and the man by the door gives us all an odd look (me specifically) and awkwardly leans in to "remind" us with some attitude that "Everyone needs to be 21 to sit in the bar." We know how a bar works, and we wouldn't have had you save us a table if we didn't. And yes, I know. I do look young, but starting off my first 10 seconds in your restaurant with that kind of awkward experience didn't put me on the right foot. It's a small thing, but most restaurants don't make a big deal out of it and the server didn't once we were seated and ordered drinks (standard ID check then), this guy just might want to reconsider jumping to conclusions on younger patrons.Anyway, overall the food was great. I'll give them that. They have a couple of unique dishes, and a nice and simple menu. There were some odd things about the place though, like $2 for bread and butter? Really, when your entrees are in the $20-$30 range, bread for the table is pretty standard, and I wouldn't say this was anything better than usual. Also, be prepared for one check and one check only (the old school hand-written kind). The atmosphere, however, was lovely, and I would say we might go back... maybe the service was just an off night. 4 stars for food quality and 2 stars for SLOW service. &#160;We were seated at 6 pm and placed our orders at 6:08. &#160;The salad &amp; soup arrived at 6:30 followed by the entrees at 6:48. &#160;There were only 4 other parties at various stages of their meals. &#160;It's an open kitchen setting so we could see that there were plenty of help, so we're not sure why everything took so long. &#160;We took advantage of Seattle Restaurant Week's 3-course dinner. &#160;The waitress offered bread for an additional charge which we declined. &#160;In hindsight, we should have gotten it given the long wait for our food. &#160;The waitstaffs were not that friendly and never checked on us. This is actually a return trip to Eva, but the first was a few years ago and I forgot to write down what we had so I couldn't very do a review from that, now could I? I do, however, remember a delicious warm cheese appetizer from back then - which brought us once again to Eva last evening...We had a reservation but arrived early and decided to sit in the bar area. It's more low-key (no white tablecloths like the restaurant portion) and darkly cozy, which fit my mood perfectly. My friend arrived before I did (how does he always manage to do that?) and ordered a nice bottle of Chablis. We then decided to go with appetizers and desserts in lieu of any official entrees. First up: the bread with butter and sea salt. Eva has followed the trend of some local places that dictates patrons pay for bread &amp; butter. If they're phenomenal (Bastille offers a great paid bread &amp; butter), I am okay with that but Eva's B&amp;B service didn't stand out as anything amazing. Next: Cabrales Flan with Pear Relish and Walnut Crisp. We weren't positive, but this seemed the most likely to be at least similar to the amazing warm cheese appetizer we'd enjoyed a few years back. The first order unfortunately burned while the staff was going over the night's specials, but that was fine as our server came out and apologized for the delay. We ended up ordering the parsnip soup, that that arrived while we were waiting for the flan to finish in the kitchen. Parsnip soup: creamy, light-as-air texture and light, savory goodness on the tongue. Just lovely! Cabrales flan: it seemed just a little cool, which could be just the way it was supposed to come out, or it could mean they rushed it a little since the first one had burned. Either way, it was a dense, flavor-filled circular molded round topped with a delicious, dark crimson-colored pear relish. We were glad that we'd ordered the B&amp;B as the walnut crisp flatbread that came with the flan was not enough for us to finish the appetizer. We quickly ran out of the flatbread (it was delicious and nutty) and dove for the bread basket. The frisee salad that arrived on the plate was wonderful as well, lightly dressed with a slightly creamy, oniony dressing.Round two: we ordered Aunt Voula's Taramasalata with Grilled Pita Bread (go ahead: YOU pronounce "Taramasalata"...I dare you) and Grilled Wild Gulf Prawns with Thai Basil &amp; Cilantro Slaw and a Peanut-Lime Vinaigrette. Asking our server about the Taramasalata, we learned that it was a potato based dip with roe. Sounded interesting so we went for it. The Taramasalata arrived and we took our first bite. We both then looked up and said in unison: "Pureed potato salad!" Don't get me wrong, it had a wonderful flavor and the roe added a nice piquant aspect. But it seriously reminded my of my mom's potato salad, just whipped up into a frenzy. Quite good and it added a whimsical element to our dinner. The prawns were perfectly grilled and while there wasn't much vinaigrette, we dredged the prawns through it until there was no more. Time for dessert! Loving the idea of lots of little bites, we had to try the 'Eva Trio': &#160; &#160; Muscat Wine Ice Cream Profiterole with Salted Caramel; Chocolate-Coconut Pot de Cr&#232;me; Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Ice Cream. Then we spied the Coconut Cream 'Pie' with Coconut Whipped Cream and couldn't resist. The standouts of all the desserts were the ice creams, both the muscat wine flavor and the cream cheese flavor. The pot de creme was amazingly dense and velvety - it could have stood all on it's own as dessert. I was a tad disappointed at the delicateness of the coconut flavor in the coconut cream pie - let me explain. When I saw the layers of coconut in the dessert description, I was expecting to be wowed by the explosion of coconut flavor and it just wasn't there. That could simply be an issue with my expectation. Overall, it tasted more like a subtle vanilla than the warm coconut flavor I was anticipating. Good, but missing a key element. Note on the service: overall, great attention to our table (and so friendly!) but a little slow. Caveat on that: they were very attentive to timing and kept asking us if we wanted various dishes brought out together or staggered. One example of the lag: we were working on the second round of appetizers and went ahead and ordered dessert. We figured that by the time we finished the apps, dessert would be about ready to hit the table. Not so. After we finished our apps and the table was cleared, our server then asked us if it was okay to go ahead and put in the dessert order. For us, we didn't have anywhere to go so lollygagging over our meal worked just fine. Just know to order everything and specify timing if you have somewhere to be after your meal. We had an amazing Valentine's Day dinner here from start to finish. The waitress warned us there was a short delay because it was packed, but we weren't in any rush and I thought the drinks/meals came out very timely, actually. I started things off right with a cocktail, the Edna Million. Wow. A fruity cocktail made with two of my favorite drinks: whiskey and red wine. I never imagined them together, but this is a wonderful drink. The mussels and pear salad were ordered next, both tastw fantastic. Then came the main course, and it was splendid. Roasted duck with the most amazing eggplant I've ever had. I really appreciated how each part of the dish complimented each other. We asked which wines would pair well with what we ordered, and we both really loved what they picked for us. My wife and I stopped in to Eva for a glass of wine and dessert after having dinner down the street at Kisaku (AWESOME, btw). We actually wanted to try out The Publican but it was pretty packed in there. I'm giving Eva only two stars because, well, it's very ODD.Please note that this review isn't about the food. It's more about the service and efficiency (or lack there of). First off, Eva does present well. It looks great from the outside - clean, white tablecloths, great menu, well-stocked and attractive bar area, etc. But it gets weird very quickly. We sat down at the bar and were promptly greeted by the bartender (at least that's what we thought at first - more on this later) who gave us menus. Another person came over and gave us water. Both left promptly without a word to us. Okay... Then we wait. And wait. And while there are at least five employees milling about or shuffling order tickets around (more on this later as well), it took a full 5 minutes for us to be able to order drinks. not a terribly long time, but there weren't more than 6 tables of people in the whole place, mostly just couples already into their dinners.Finally a completely new guy comes over and just stands in front of us. I guess we're supposed to order from him? I just spit it out and he wrote it down - two desserts and a glass of port and a scotch - and walked away again. Yes, WITHOUT GETTING THE DRINKS. He wrote it on one of those old school green order notepads and left it on the bar. Then the original lady comes over (the one who gave us the menus), picks up the ticket, disappears with it, then a couple minutes later reappears and makes us our drinks and drops them off. Again without a word. This is getting odd, right? I watch her put the ticket on the back bar, shuffle it around with about 7 other tickets, and get out a huge old calculator and start adding up bills. There is no order system, no register, no organizational system whatsoever. From what I can tell, the whole place is run by shuffling and passing tickets around! Meanwhile, we're eating our okay dessert (kinda just Meh. And my scotch had WAY too much ice in it) and no fewer than all 5 employees were going in and out from behind the bar, each making different drinks, bumping into each other, shuffling tickets around, trading off glassware...it's insanity! When we were almost done with our desserts a little Mexican guy came over and I tried to order another glass of port but he didn't seem to be authorized to do so, so I waved down (politely) a new lady who got it for me promptly. When we were all done the original, original lady reappeared and when I asked for the check she spun around and went to town on her huge calculator again. After several minutes of watching her looking for our ticket in the mess of them on the counter, adding things up, writing things down, scratching something out and redoing it, then finally putting it in a little folio thing, she turned back and handed it to us. I just gave her the card to be done with it and she put it next to the card machine (at least they have one and not an old knuckle buster swipe thing!) and left to do something else. Ahhhhhhhhh! Finally, no lie, the original order-taking guy came over, ran our card and handed it back to us. And we were out as soon as I signed it.The whole thing honesty had me wondering if they'd only been open for a few days, but I come to find out they've been there for quite a while! Derrrrrr... I love Eva! My husband and I have been dining here for about 7 years, and we've never had a bad meal. We always order Aunt Voula's Taramasalata as a starter, because it's just so unique and delish. Their menu changes frequently, using local and fresh/seasonal ingredients. We love everything we've eaten at Eva! The service is usually pretty good, and your water glass will always be full. I went again with my friend. The flan was amazing. But I ordered the sardines which had an olive sauce that I thought was a bit of miss. The chicken that my friend ordered was executed to perfection. So my final verdict is skip the seafood but the chicken dishes are awesome. Deserves five stars except that the service is kinda slow. We came on Valentine's Day and were NOT disappointed, but we could see that several parties were waiting for us to finish up our meal. Loved the lobster risotto for the appetizer and the lemon cake for dessert. We come here often for special occasions since they are in the neighborhood--and they never let us down.
I've only been here once since it reopened with new management and I have to say it will be my last visit. &#160;The menu was smaller and higher priced. &#160;I thought to give the tortellini a try at $15 or $16 dollars, they were hard little packaged pasta with some fresh stuff thrown on. &#160;It kind of reminded me of semi-homemade cooking. &#160;Wait staff was nice, but the food just isn't as good as the old Angelina's. &#160;I was all set to tell the waitress about my meal when she asked how things were and that never happened. &#160;My friend had the ravioli and it seemed like canned ravioli in a sauce. &#160;The balsamic vinegar they served with the bread was so sharp. &#160;Owner did the outside on the cell phone throughout our meal. &#160;Sigh, another favorite place gone. We tried the restaurant last night - have waited a bit to let the new owners settle into a rhythm. Overall, a good experience. Host and waitstaff were very friendly and thanked us for giving them a chance. I appreciated that they acknowledged things that had changed while pointing out new additions. I think that's important for regulars to hear this. The dining room is very open and loud. They should consider adding some acoustic or fabric panels. Would not recommend bringing anyone here who is hard of hearing. The new menu is a la carte, so no more salad with entree. However, I got the 1/2 green salad with the familiar creamy herb dressing and it was delicious. Huge portion for a 1/2 salad. For dinner I had the cannelloni, which was the same as it used to be. Love the marinara and alfredo sauce combination. My husband had a 1/2 Caesar and the spaghetti with meatballs, which was all homemade and yummy. They still serve the Como bread and the olive oil and balsamic were good quality. We had a Manny's on draft for $4, which seemed reasonable. All in all, I'm glad they've kept some of the Angelina's charm and worked to clean up the interior and revamp things a bit. Now, if we could just get the noise level down, we'd be in good shape. We'll be coming here again. Tasty food, great new placeI've been waiting for the new place to open, having seen videos of the construction on the West Seattle Blog. Our first visit was on a Monday night, where they give free kids meals, and all 4 visitors (3 adults, 1 toddler) were pleased as punch. The food was great. My wife and her dad (visiting from out of town) are cowboy carnivores, I'm a vegan, and our baby is a fuss-budget. The bread that came before the meal was a nice touch. One thing that stood out was that they don't use Trader Joe's olive oil for their dip plate. It was good and tasty, lots of flavor. Our meals were delayed a bit because they prepared egg-free noodles for me, but I was relieved and grateful to get the extra consideration. It turns out they cater to gluten-free sensitivities as well as vegetarians, so that was a big plus for me straight away. The food looked great for everyone. Both of the non-vegetarian meals were generous, and the house sauce was really rich and good. My meal, the putta nesca, was delicious. I wouldn't rank it as the best I've had, but, considering they were smart enough to leave the useless anchovies out of the recipe, it was almost as good as what I'd make at home. Even our son, who doesn't eat anything he can't play with beforehand, ate half my wife's chicken and all of his spaghetti. Before it was over, I bribed him into eating his meatballs by trading him bite-for-bite with chunks of chicken from my wife's meal.The awesomest part of the meal was the family atmosphere. The staff is really playful with kids and want to make it a nice relief for parents. The baby's meal was free, but I would have gladly paid. I'm so sick of paying $5 for crappy food, this place got it right AND it's free. He got the aforementioned spaghetti and meatballs, ice cream for desert, and, as a really nice gesture from the owners' daughter's birthday party at the next table over, a complimentary piece of chocolate cake. Altogether, holy crap! Again, I have just resigned to a nasty plastic mac &amp; cheese plate for my kids money, but they give you real food that I assume is the same stock they serve to adults. There are restaurants that don't even have high chairs, and this one gives us toys to play with and free candy without turning the whole restaurant into a romper room. Really appreciated and long overdue for a family-dense neighborhood.All the while, mind you, Admiral regulars were trickling in and out to visit the bar. This place has a lot of life, which is nice to experience since I can't enjoy it myself without a babysitter. In the end, I was very pleasantly surprised. I'm not a fan of Italian food anyway, and I had both a great dinner and a great night. Monday nights, baby!Bottom line: The new owners made this a great family spot. The other pizza/Italian places in West Seattle are either too big to pay attention to you or too small to show you a nice time. This is a great addition to our community, you'll probably see me there next week!
Back in the corner in a strip mall at 12th &amp; Jackson, this Vietnamese restaurant offers more upscale dining than most places in the International District. &#160;I went for the 7 Courses of Beef, a meat flavor feast at a pretty reasonable price (although you have to order it for 2 people). &#160;Great food and a pleasant atmosphere, it's no wonder this place is starting to get packed.
I always like good pizza and will always pay more for it. Zekes is not acception. Good pizza for the price. I have to to a couple other locations and they are have the same good quality across the board. My friend and I were at Brew at the Zoo and needed some food before we went anywhere and Zekes, not only being close was the best decision to make. We ordered a Cherry Bomb and bread sticks. Not only did it help to soak up a little of the great beer we had but it was tasty too. The sausage and cherry peppers were a perfect combination and the bread stick were good as well for something many others have a hard time doing right. It was my own fault, I admit. &#160;I had read the reviews but we were going with another couple who couldn't afford Verace's - we should have hit Sopranos....or pizza hut.Good - friendly servers. &#160;Free ranch dressing. &#160;Lots of choices.Bad - The pizza. &#160;Seriously, when it gets to your table the first thing you notice is (wow, it really DOES look like frozen pizza), totally no cheese over really fluffy dough, minimal sauce. &#160;It just didn't have any flavor. &#160;I was laying in bed this morning, thinking about the fact that I had leftovers for lunch and said to myself 'ew'. &#160;That bad.I'm giving two stars because there are so many better options in Seattle, but this place wasn't too expensive and didn't charge for ranch. &#160;Yay. The food was great! I loved it. &#160;I'm not big into pizza, but this place had great selection and loved the different styles. &#160;The breadsticks were awesome too! &#160;Although on one bite it had too much garlic, but I still enjoyed it. &#160;Now on another note, the reason for not giving this place 4 or 5 stars, I think we came on the wrong day or time. &#160;Our waitress looked exhausted and flustered. &#160;She didn't give us enough plates or silverware for our party and we had to get our own booster seats for the kids. &#160;Though she was friendly, it was definitely an annoyance that we constantly had to ask for things. &#160;But everyone has bad days.....I would come back to this place. Pros: Fresh ingredients, big, creative menu, fairly fast deliveryCons: REALLY skimpy toppings, kinda pricey for what you get, delivery feeOverall, I am underwhelmed with the flavors and the value. There's hardly any sauce or cheese, and one of the pieces of the pizza we ordered literally had only one sad slice of olive on it. The crust is doughy, the toppings nowhere near the edge of the pizza, and it's just bland.I really wanted to like this pizza since I just moved down the street from a Zeeks, but going forward, I'll just stick with Pagliacci. We've gone to Zeeks a few times and ordered delivery for parties simply because they're so close. The reason I'm leaving only 3 stars is because their pizza is good, but it's not THAT good. If I'm going to be paying $25 for a pizza it better be one hell of a pie. Just never been all that impressed I guess. I do like their patio though. Best restaurant in Seattle that I have been to. Also the most kid-friendly! It causes lots of commotion when I hear we are getting pizza.I enjoy going with my friends (they like pizza to ) I am glad we know about that place. P.s.I love their cheese pizza!
Service was great, the bartender/waitress was very nice. &#160;Food was just OK, not great, but not terrible. &#160;It was a Tuesday night so it wasn't busy, us and maybe 6 other patrons and they were all seated at the bar talking to the bartender. &#160;In the middle of dinner out of nowhere they started blasting some weird, eccentric music that even Soundhound couldn't make out. Nice folks all around! This place has been cleaned up and remodeled since I was there last, I like the change! &#160;Service was good, food and drink were good. &#160;More stars next time if that A/C kicking on and off that was blowing ice cold air down my neck gets fixed.
I'm pretty sure someone who was born and raised in Washington state wouldn't know good BBQ if it slapped them in the face. However, Pig Iron was pretty good. I started with a plate of friend green tomatos, which are honestly the best thing on the menu. If you go, definitely order up 2-3 servings of those!The entrees were OK. I appreciate that they BBQ their meats with sauce and spices and don't leave them bare. For some reason this is a trend up here. A horrible, sacrilegious trend. The brisket I had was very tender and their sauce selection was OK - not award winning.The issue I had with the menu was that when I think of BBQ I think of a big pile of food - different meats all on one plate. Maybe it was just the lunch menu, but I didn't see options to combine anything. I love great barba ma quue! As Homer would say, so I tried the pig iron. First off the service was a little slow (only one person serving, and it was a Saturday,) but no big problem. Had the brisket plate with the corn bread dressing and the smoked beans. The brisket was awesome great smoke ring and flavor was spot on. The cornbread dressing was really interesting tasted like and very moist tamale, had a really good jalapeno taste. The smoked beans were not what you expect, taste more like a chili than a baked bean, unexpected but great. The carolina mustard sauce is right there and there regular sauce fits perfect with the brisket. I would say that it is a little overpriced and that would be the reason for 4 stars. Great stuff! Went here last week with my friends and her fam for a goodbye dinner. They've come here a lot apparently and it's an old favorite. I had the pulled pork sandwich and was very happy--I do wish I tried some of their sauces more to test them out (they offered a sweeter one and a spicier chipotle one I believe). The other folks I was with had the fried green tomato sandwich, the brisket plate, and the ribs. I was extremely satisfied, though my main complaint was that they wouldn't allow any substitutions with sides. Why I couldn't get sweet potato fries (aka my guilty pleasure) as my side to a sandwich unless I ordered the much more expensive plate? Seemed silly to restrict the sandwich eaters to either cole slaw or potato salad. Cole slaw was pretty decent though. A bit too out of the way for me normally, but I would definitely eat there again if I was in the neighborhood (let's face it, probably infrequent, but shhh)They did have some nice mixed drinks, served in preserve jars. Helped add to the ambience, but don't know how good the margaritas actually were. I really enjoyed my food here, unlike what others have said. I ordered a 1/4 breast of smoked chicken, with BBQ sauce off (you can put your own on). It was great white meat, so tender, and a hefty portion of protein. I was impressed! Good flavor! With it I ordered some lower carb sides, so opted for the collard greens and the spinach casserole. I was pleased and impressed by both sides! Good sized portions, and the spinach casserole was cheesy goodness. I seriously want that recipe!! The slice of bread that came with the meal was not needed, as wasn't even toasted. My husband ordered the BBQ pork, which he enjoyed. His cream of corn and cole slaw were also good. The salad we ordered with dinner was a bit pricey, but was tasty. Too bad they only have 1 salad dressing there, but it was quite good. Good, quick service, as the place had few people there.Come on folks...go get some good BBQ at Pig Iron- I highly recommend a plate, not sandwich, as you'll get lots of meat, and good sized sides. Nice selection of beers, too. Pig Iron BBQ Rocks! &#160;If you just want good food, this place is it. &#160;The brisket is the best in town and many of the sides mouth watering. &#160;Food is defintely 5+ stars, service is a bit spotty and is 2 or 3. &#160;The alcoholic beverages are watered down and expensive, so don't bother. I've only been there once, had the pulled pork sandwich. &#160;Like someone else said, I'm kind of surprised now by all the great reviews.The meat was dry (yes, I put extra sauce on it, but shouldn't it already have had some flavor?). The sauce I tried was bland (I think it was their regular). &#160;And, when I opened my take out box, there was a huge piece of pork skin/fat in my sandwich. &#160;I am pretty sure the guy slopping it on the lame-ass bun would have seen it if he took 2 seconds to look. &#160;So for $10, I definitely wouldn't go back which is sad because I really wanted to like it and I really like BBQ. The Pig Iron is our choice for BBQ in Seattle. They have Shiner Bock on tap, cherry limeade, and some of the best brisket I've ever had. I love their Puyallup Fair sauce.As a rule, their sides are excellent and bring a lot of flavor and verve to the BBQ of one's choice.The downside is slow service. However, it's worth it more often than not. A friend actually recommended Slim's Last Chance Saloon next door for the chili, but Slim's is a "21 and over" joint, and I was with my younger daughter so we decided on Pig Iron instead. Well, that and when I checked out Yelp! I saw my three favorite words...."Shiner on tap". Pig Iron had promise. It even had an unpaved parking lot. :) But would the food live up to the promise? My daughter and I both had the beef brisket sandwich, her's with beans, and mine with cole slaw, an order of sweet potato fries, iced tea, and of course Shiner on tap. OK....I was born in MS, grew up in New Orleans, and lived in TX for 10 years, so I've had some really good BBQ over the years. The Meat: I'm a fan of dry rubs, smoked meat, and a spicy sauce on the side. The brisket at Pig Iron was good.....but not great. There was a hint of a smoke ring so I assume the beef was smoked, and it was tender, but it lacked any real flavor. The Sauce: You've got your choice of three. The "house" sauce is a pretty standard vinegar tomato sauce. It's good, but nothing to write home about. The setup on the table also included a mustard based sauce (a Carolina thing I guess) which was tasty on the sweet potato fries, and a chipotle sauce which was the best of the bunch, but still pretty mild. The Sides: The cole slaw was really good. Crisp cabbage with a fair amount of carrot, and not too much mayo. The beans were good. Smokey and tasty. And the sweet potato fries were outstanding. Crispy and salty (my two favorite food groups). The Staff: Awesome! Friendly and attentive without hovering over us to the point of uncomfortable. The Other Stuff: The Red Velvet Cake was really, really good. Not too sweet, moist, great crumb, cream cheese frosting that tasted like...cream cheese. Save some room and share a slice with your table mates. The Price: It was a bit more than I expected for "cue" but all in all, a good value for your dollar. Overall, Pig Iron is better than most of the BBQ places in the Seattle area that I've tried (and I've tried quite a few) If Gordy's were still open in North Bend, Pig Iron wouldn't hold a candle to it, but it's not so Pig Iron is a nice alternative. I lived in central Texas for over a decade(where there is real bbq) so I think my opinion counts here. The food here is about the best BBQ I have found in Seattle, that being said...it still is not on par with any of the million BBQ joints in the south. First off it is inconsistent, one day you may get a good smoke ring on the brisket and it is nice and moist, and the next it is dried out and flavorless. The very worst thing about Seattle BBQ is the price, BBQ is supposed to be the poor peoples food, which means cheap. Pig Iron does not disappoint in the price dept, IT IS CRAZY EXPENSIVE FOR BBQ! &#160;Give it a shot, it may be good that day, but be prepared to pay! About the only thing going for Pig Iron is Shiner Draft... Melt-in-your mouth BBQ. &#160;Just how yo momma made it side dishes. &#160;A cool trucker/biker/piercings/jailhouse tats vibe. &#160;Waitstaff that looks scary but who are actually super cool and friendly. &#160;Oh Jesus they have sweet tea too! Just hook it up to an IV on my muthatruckin arm...I'm home baby!The sweet potato fries can be limp and soggy sometimes but when they're not you want to stand up and sign an aria. &#160;Either way I will admit that they are tasty. &#160;Go to Pig Iron BBQ often. &#160;But don't tell too many people about it. &#160;Let's just keep this secret to ourselves, K? &#160;It is just THAT good. Yum... i love it. Certainly my favorite BBQ-esque joint in the Seattle area.Don't miss the jalapeno-spinach greens... they are to die for. In fact, they should be promoted from side dish to main dish, if you ask me.I'm kind of surprised at all the bad reviews, but I understand that there are a lot of traditionalists out there that insist on BBQ being prepared a certain way. I'm really kind of surprised by all the 5star reviews. I definitely didn't find it offensive enough to rate 1 star, but it was definitely nothing special.The pulled pork was moist, but the sauce was pretty flavorless. The slaw was a bit more carrot heavy than I tend to like, but again- pretty bland.Yes, I'm from the south- I take my BBQ seriously. However, I brought a friend along from NYC who doesn't have much experience with BBQ- the first thing he commented on as we left was how bland everything was.Not terrible, not great. Definitely not worth $10 for a sandwich and a side. On a positive note, the sweet tea was almost the closest thing I've tasted to a real glass since I moved up here. Been a while since I've been here... But I absolutely loved this place. But my first choice is Caveman out in Kent. But this place comes a close second because it's so close to where I live. My hubby and I had a pulled pork sandwhich with slaw and the sweet potato fries with the fried green tomatoes as a starter. Loved the green tomatoes but the sauce for them was kinda on the salty side.The food was great and so was the service. I myself have 10 tattoos and it's nice to see other people working "normal," out in the open jobs and not having their employer be discrimitive.Definately wanna go back here some time soon... 1 word....SLATHER! The 'slather' sauce that goes with the fries is SO good! Their sweet potato fries are some of the best in the area, so I highly recommend those and their fried green tomatoes. Add some slather and you're good to go!Their pulled pork sandwich is by far my favorite thing on the menu, but their ribs are a close second. (my mouth is watering just talking about it!). I worked in Georgetown for 3 years and this place made the "take out" list quite often with me and my coworkers. If you are going in to sit down, don't expect much from the decor, but expect a lot from the food! Great barbecue places have long wooden benches with protruding nails that give you tetanus. What I'm saying is, the food tastes better when the decor is not contrived, and the food is great here. Juicy, tender meat with sweet and savory sauces, and just the right amount of grease. Gross? &#160;Yes. &#160;I think the pulled pork was really from the large rat traps they have stationed underneath the crawl space of the place. (yes, we saw huge rat traps) &#160;Ok, so I'm exaggerating, but when our order of a pulled pork sandwich arrived, it was on a plain white bun that was cold. &#160;Not even grilled inside. &#160;The meat was dry and at room temperature and had no detectable smokiness to it. &#160;The sweet potato fries were more "fun" than tasty, as they had an interesting mayo based dip and various BBQ sauces to immerse them in. &#160;The beans were pretty good though super sweet. &#160;I left hungry, because I didn't want to gorge myself on the boring bun and mediocre meat. &#160;Even if the meat had actually tasted like it was smoked, it still would have been over-priced for what we were served. &#160;Disappointed..... Full liquor is a nice option for lunch, but not if I have to go back to work. &#160;The bbq is decent, not my favorite, I guess I like the real Southern kind; either that, or I'm just darn picky. &#160;I like the decor of the place, it fits the Georgetown mood of an industrial-yet-divey joint to satisfy some bbq needs. &#160;The fried green tomatoes are laughable, they're so bad and burned. &#160;The place is a bit more expensive than what you would consider a value. Good pulled pork sandwich, but a little pricy. Coleslaw was very good.
I really enjoy Sunday breakfast at Pesos regardless of whether I've been drinking the night before. I've been once or twice on a weekend and it can get pretty crowded. I've also tried the happy hour and wasn't impressed. Eggs it is. I never go to Peso's anymore because of the meat market instinct that permeates the entire joint. &#160;I never got service to save my life. &#160;But I have to admit a new fondness for the breakfast happy hour. &#160;$6 for everything on the menu? &#160;Brilliant. &#160;For all of us who tend to get atrociously drunk on the weekdays, only to have to go to work the next day and function, this breakfast happy hour is a brilliant, brilliant idea. &#160;Take it to go! &#160;Eat it in your cube and pretend to work all day while in actuality you are just trying to undo the fuzziness of your head! I probably don't want to know the calorie count of the burrito I just ate, but it was damn tasty and big enough that I don't need to eat for the rest of the day! &#160;And I don't think I'm hungover anymore... Food &#160;= P.F. Chang's version of Mexican &#160;Service = Just like any other bar Crowd = Attractive youngsters who can't dance Atmosphere = Cozy, but extremely loud music so you can't hear a word someone is saying 2 feet from you, and there is no dance floor? &#160;Misc = &#160;What the *&amp;(* kind of bar sells you Modelo in a can, no wait there's a lime in it...so now I don't look like I smuggled it in.~G If you're looking for a dive bar, avoid this place (note the title of this establishment is Peso's Kitchen and _Lounge_), and see some of my other reviews on dive bars. Peso's Lounge may be the place to take someone you don't know too well yet, or someone that may not enjoy camping, rock climbing, or gardening.Brian (and Allen) Hutmacher really did a great thing for Seattle by growing Peso's into one of the best little Mexican Cuisines in the Northwest. While other &#160;very cool mexican cuisines have come and gone in this town since the Hutmachers opened this place in 1998, Peso's has evolved into one of the most consistently tasty places in town. Peso's has 3 attractive elements to its shtick-- 1) If you're in the bar having great drinks you quickly become distracted by the entrees being served nearby and outside of the bar area, 2) if you're in the restaurant section you have a great view of the bar scene and you're tempted to move over there after eating, and 3) it's one of the better happy hour and breakfast places in town. It's no wonder then that one could practically spend all their earnings there on great drinks and great food.Now, here's the rub-- the waitstaff is hit and miss, the servers are usually overtaxed and just trying to survive through the human traffic, and if you're dining in less than a party of 4 then you probably won't get as much attention as a full table of people. It must be difficult to manage tables at a place like this, and you'd have to be a very talented server not to get too flustered here.I still keep coming back here, though, and it's because of the quality and consistency of the entrees. I also like the convenience of being able to have dinner at midnight (dinner is served until 1am). They have a decent happy hour daily from 3-6 p.m. and from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. Although I haven't had the privilege yet of trying "Pesos, the morning after", they do serve breakfast 7 days a week 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and I have never heard an ill word spoken about it to date.Note: Some people legitimately complain of well-trafficked, non-gender-biased bars (such as this one) as being a "meat market". Might I suggest that maybe you come to the dark side, maybe go she-bop, and hit Ozzie's 1 block south. I love everything about Peso's except the people who go there. &#160;God, what a meat market! &#160;And at a Mexican place? &#160;It's a crying shame because I love the place, love the food but everytime I think about going there I'm like "eeww, I don't want to have to hang around popped-collar guy all night"Parking in impossible too!!! The service is slow and the female servers are just plain bitchy. They will ask my husband what he wants, refill his water, and completely ignore me. Umm hey, I'm the one paying honey. But, the happy hour menu rocks. The beef tips are great and the nachos are huge and cheesey, and only $4. The only thing I have ever had not on the happy hour menu is the fajitas which are also quite tasty. The margaritas are strong, but a bit pricey. Though if your foods only $4 you can afford a few. It's been too long. I had no idea Peso's became a nightclub. It felt like one anyway. The doormen, a &#160;DJ playing back to back songs from Timbaland's last record at amazing volume, a great looking and very young crowd worshiping at the temple..ummm, sorry, bar.Did it matter? No. The dining room is beautiful at night. Those sconces are Aliens Meet Puget Sound Energy. The color scheme is somehow soothing in the middle of clubland.The drinks are consistent, delicious. &#160;And the servers delivering them? Consistently gorgeous. The food is perfect for late night noshing. And the servers delivering it? Perfect and gorgeous.Well, that's it really. Except parking is a challenge after 11PM.. Take a spot at Kidd Valley and walk across the street. Or tip big with the valet at Marqueen Hotel. Otherwise, good luck.Did I mention the servers? We wandered over between the Dalai Lama and Dave Matthews/Tim Reynolds at Key Arena hoping to have a quick, but healthy and delicious dinner. &#160;The place was packed, but they got us right in and service was great and efficient with a cute waitress. &#160;We ordered tapas which were healthy and yummy and they came quick.The atmosphere is fun, but it was super crowded with raucous people even at 6pm and so noisy that we could barely hear each other talk. Yessssssssssssssss! &#160;Not only do I love Pesos for their fantastic food and drinks - but let's not forget about happy hour here. &#160;Happy hour at pesos makes me so happy. &#160;I'm a huge fan of their whole menu. &#160;Oh, and did I mention breakfast on the weekends!? &#160;The best eggs benedict around (QA Cafe is a close second). &#160;Also they have this enchilada lasagna which is amazing. &#160;I recommend accompanying your gourmet breakfast with mimosas or bloody marys (if that's your style) (if yes - notice plurality) :) &#160;Oh! &#160;I almost forgot - the atomosphere is super cool too. &#160;Oh! &#160;And they play pretty good music. &#160;Yeah, it's confirmed. &#160;I love this place. &#160;Completely unrelated side note: There is a spam can hidden somewhere in the restaurant - if you find it let me know! After reading other reviews, I'm glad to see that my waitress wasn't just a bitch to my group, she's like that with everyone! She acted completely annoyed to be there, and she actually stared at herself in the mirror the entire time she was at our table. Yes honey, your seventh layer of lip gloss is shockingly still on from when you applied it 5 minutes ago! Another waitress ended up doing more work than her, picking up our empty plates and getting us refills- I wish we could have tipped her instead! FYI, we were sitting at the bar area, so maybe the restaurant part has better service. The food at Peso's gets 5 stars, but they need better hiring practices than just looking for tits and ass. I don't care for this place but you certainly might. Especially if you:* like going to bars to check out girls/guys* are the type of person who likes to raise one fist in the air and go "woo-hoo" or enjoy wearing your baseball cap backwards and high-fiving other people who enjoy wearing their baseball cap backwards.* enjoy drinking alcoholic beverages that have almost all the taste of alcohol drowned out by sugary sweet syrup so that you can get drunk without having to actually taste alcohol* are looking for girls who got really drunk while enjoying above mentioned alcoholic beveragesThat said ... I do go there occasionally for the happy hour breakfast (weekday mornings) when all the breakfast items are half price. Sunday brunch isn't too bad and they seem to do a quick turnover so that the lines are never too long.I've had dinner a few times ... the service was basically passable but hardly remarkable and maybe even just borderline competent ... the food itself wasn't bad but nothing special. It's very watered down Tex-Mex which isn't always a bad thing. I'll start by saying that I have not eaten dinner here in years. &#160;No, I haven't. &#160;I go for the M-F 9:00 - 11:00 $6 breakfast. &#160;Some items are $8 bucks such as the crab eggs Benedict that I dream about. &#160;About once a month I just have to put off work and stop off at Peso's at 9:00 sharp for my bennie fix. &#160;I haven't had anything else although the menu contains about 35 breakfast items many of which look very interesting. &#160;I will say the staff could use some training, they are slow, and don't really ever seem to be enjoying their job. &#160;Maybe it's too early and they're just too busy serving up cheap eats. &#160;Put a smile on your face kids, it's money in your pocket. &#160;That, if nothing else, should cheer you all up!UPDATE: 11/15/2007Had breakfast here today and the waitress was friendly - so &#160;she got a good tip. &#160;Crab eggs benedict was delicious as usual! This is definitely not a place to go for Mexican food. &#160;If you're looking for a decent lounge it's ok, but there are plenty other places in a close walk from Pesos to get your drink on.The food was pretentious and over priced. &#160;About the only thing I like about Pesos is the decor, it's a fairly pretty interior, albeit not a lot of space. People have this place pretty much nailed down in other reviews, so instead of writing more of the same, I'm going to summarize Pesos in a simple equation:Azteca / 2 + Joey's / 2 = Pesos Too crowded on the weekends for me. I am more a dive bar kind of girl. However, I am giving them 4 stars for the hangover breakfast. Here is my hangover solution:pesos on sat. morning+sunglasses+breakfast burrito+mimosa = no more hangover by 1pm.Update: When I was back in town I gave the appetizers a shot. What a great happy hour deal! The waitress recommended the grilled asparagus; I was not disappointed. Grilled perfectly with a nice vinaigrette. Can I give 1 star for service and 5 stars for the food?First visit: &#160;BF, his friend, and me, server forgets to put the order in, and our food comes out in 40 minutes....total turn-off. &#160;Not even worth writing a review for.Second visit: &#160;BFF, co-worker, and me, server gives us the wrong check and charges us double our bill, doesn't refill our coffee AND our water. &#160;BTW, we ask if they have espresso, a mocha with whip to be exact, and she gives me this dumbfounded look and tells me in a matter of fact tone- Um.....we only have COFFEE, and "There's a cafe around the corner if you really want one, you can walk across the street. "BUT, the food was tasty, flavorful, and just really really good. &#160;Between the three of us we ordered the stuffed french toast with creme fraiche, the eggsadilla, and the crab and avocado omelet. &#160;What do you expect with their $6 Happy Hour Breakfast. How odd that I haven't written a review of Peso's before this. It's our go-to brunch spot for out of towners. I think it's because of two things- one: the proximity to the party/crash pad with the most floor space, and two: breakfast margaritas. The latter of these will kick your ass ten ways to sunday. I can only drink about half of one, because I have the alcohol tolerance of a tsetse fly. The food is HUMONGOUS GIGANTE. And pretty dang delicious, I might add. Everything's Seattle-brunch priced about $12, and the drinks aren't cheap, nor is the coffee. Oh, and the coffee? IT'S LACED WITH COCAINE. So be careful.Peso's- enabling Seattleites for ten years now? Has it been that long? I have no idea, but it sounds good. Why do I like Peso's? I'll tell you ~ Happy Hour Breakfast! &#160;Good food for a good price. &#160; You just have to get past the O'so charming service.I am all for Happy hour, even if it's for breakfast. The fun &amp; intimate atmosphere hooked immediately, but the grilled prawns wrapped with bacon and the spicy fried fresh calamari with a jalapeno-spanish aioli melted my heart and won my allegiance.Low-lighting, funky hip decor, cool music, and a there-to-be-seen crowd create a great environment to try to some interesting (overpriced) tapas and other mexican-ish concoctions. &#160;The food was actually unique and very very very tasty. &#160;The food we ordered was also rather rich, but managed to avoid being greasy.The space is divided into restaurant and bar, but only by the arrangment of the tables and not really by a wall. &#160;The open layout makes the place feel cozy without feeling cramped. &#160;The bar does have a bit more of the "meat-market" vibe, but the restaurant side struck a nice balance of family, friends, and hot couples on romantic dates.My complaints rest in the weak overpriced cocktails and the just-barely-better-than-mediocre service. &#160;Our server was nice and fairly good, she just seemed aloof and distracted. &#160;My water glass stayed full...which is one of my most important criteria for a good dining experience.Peso's is also a tad more expensive than I usually prefer, but the happy hour menu looked delicious at half the price. This place is effin' good! Dayum.....the 'Big Easy'....creole. jalapeno-corn. gravy...*drool*.We had to wait to be seated for brunch on Saturday but where in Seattle that's worth it do you NOT have to wait? Seriously. Maybe they should open the Ballard Denny's again after all. Wait! - no - I take that back! Just foolin'.Anyway. It's worth the wait and our server was delightful and attentive. Love Peso's. &#160;Best hangover breakfast ever. &#160;I don't really mind the way it gets really packed at night and features a high DB percentage... especially if I am safely ensconced in a protective booth, giving me a nice 'Bag buffer. &#160;There is nothing better for entertainment than some DB watching. &#160;Why, just last night at Peso's, I watched a trio of Douchey McMassengills compete for this one girl's attention. &#160;She wasn't even that cute, I'm not sure why the cluster f***. &#160;Anyway, using his finely honed skillz, one guy eventually won out and we had a good ol' time critiquing their face-sucking techniques for the next 30 minutes. &#160;It was kind of impressive, they didn't even come up for air that whole time!So, the migas rule, and I really love the way Peso's is decorated with lots of handmade art. &#160;Wrought iron candle holders, lots of Dia de los Muertos type skeletons, and the hand made solid wood table tops are nice to look at if you get tired of the DB Show. Meat market: check.Inattentive staff: check.Pretty good tuna sandwich: check.Happy hour to lure people to its dark lair: check.Will I be going back there soon: Hell to the no. Peso's has a &#160;great location, but it's nothing special nonetheless.It feels more like a place that is trying to give you money instead of a really great dining experience. I felt like I was at a sold-out rock concert for a band that broke up 10 years ago. I mean, Mexican-inspired food is not hard to come by, so to speak. Peso's has a really interesting restaurant as far as decor goes (some whole Dia de los Muertos thing behind the counter). The food is fabulous for ordering as an office lunch to go. I wasn't sure what the place was like just to hang out, so I thought I'd grab a friend and give it a try. The place was really noisy when we got through the door. &#160;It was bustling, which was a good sign when we got there. At least it's popular.We went in during happy hour and were seated immediately in the only open space in the bar area, which is large (much to their credit). A line of people came by with forks and napkins, then water, and finally someone to take our order. We were surprised to find that there were not happy hour drink specials, just food.We checked out the menu, but did not find anything too incredibly appealing to vegetarians. Everything is meat, even their stuffed peppers, which sound amazing. Alas, we only tried the chips and salsa. Both were fresh, but neither was really better than average.We got our drinks, which were okay. Really, again, nothing out of the ordinary. We thought it kind of funny to even have to order chips and salsa, let alone ask for a refill. And the way that our waitress kept touching our arms led us to believe that she'd offer good food service instead of some strange hint at something else. meh, just mehI really keep trying to like this place since moving three blocks away from it. But Sunday brunch- not great, I don't understand the reviews-who likes this food? Its so meh, it must be drunk people loving the review. I just went today for lunch and my roomie ordered the avocado burger and I ordered the BLT with avocado (says this on the menu, not an add on) Low and behold- NO avocado on anyones plate. I would have been happy to tell our server, but after dropping the food she never came back, except to drop the check, which she had ready for us before asking if we wanted another beveridge. Really people? This is how you do it? Not great. Is this really a Mexican restaurant? I don't know... I had their fried tortilla chips and salsa (not bad). I also had the fried chicken salad which wasn't Mexican... but it was surprisingly good, and that's the point right?I keep hearing about the breakfast as well but never go. it's supposed to be their regular $10-15 stuff for $6.I didn't pick up on the meat market aspect of this place... Personally, it doesn't bother me but I'm from LA you understand... It must be that I was there for a business lunch or Saturday noon isn't the right time for it. I give Peso's three stars for a couple of reasons:First - I loved Vince's and am still slightly resentful of Peso's for moving into the one place in Seattle that boasted a buy 3 get the 4th free pizza offer.Second - I pretty much always hate my hoochie waitress. &#160;The attitude that comes with their fake and baked, clearly bulimic outer crust annoys the shit out of me. &#160;"Look here sweetie! &#160;I was young and hot once too! &#160;You're not better than me you skank!" &#160;See? &#160;I hate when I go there.When I go, it's usually before a Sonics game or a play. &#160;I am not there to party (although I did do a lot when it first opened and I was a hot, young, YET NICE, waitress at that Italian thing Duke failed so miserably with). &#160;So I go for the food.I LOVE the Chicken Fried Chicken with Jalapeno gravy. &#160;Creamy, and almost comforting were it not for the zap given off by that kick ass gravy. &#160;Tasty, tasty and sure to keep me full for a couple of days.I also am a fan of the Carne Asada - haven't had it in a spell, but as I recall there was something awesome and Habenero about it.I have never had the breakfast, but have heard about it for a couple, few years now and think I might have to try to get there. &#160;I just guess that it's not the best place for a 2 year old - but who knows? &#160;The son is for sure young, and way cute. I actually looked up this place before going to meet with a bunch of friends (a group of 8+ there) for a celebration dinner.And well. It sucked.The food was Azteca level (though some claimed to enjoy it) and the service was absolute crap. The Waiter spilled food on me!!! And was plain rude to us the whole time! She even sat down at our table when taking our order, I had to ask her if she was a our Waiter (she didn't make it obvious). Overall the decor of the place was pretty cool and it seemed like a hot spot for singles to go to get seen so maybe they can take someone home. I mean the people there were REALLY trying, girls dressed like their Paris Hilton... etc... The place wasn't really my scene. To me it was 2 stars.Nothing really captivated me. Just another restaurant with a popular bar and rude waitresses. Peso's - I think we are breaking up. Everyone on Yelp tells me I can do better for Mexican food and I suppose they are right......but getting a table at La Carta de Oaxaca is so hard, and I'm done playing games....and the food at Senor Moose is delicious but later on it hurts since they use so much garlic, and I am done choosing &#160;things that I know aren't good for me. ...and the Rancho Bravo Taco Truck is just so far away and I'm done with long distance relationships. So, Peso's, that leaves you as my Mexican restaurant, but not by choice, simply by process of elimination. I know you try to woo me in with your promise of delicious chips and guacamole, but then all you have is stale old chips, and while your menu looks great on paper it tends to fail in execution, and the wait staff might try to smile but honestly I fail to see any sense of humor, and really I want someone who can make me laugh. I guess it's healthier for both of us to try to find better matches. I'm going to go ahead and place my bets on a new restaurant opening up and sweeping me off my feet and you can...uhhh....wait for someone who likes stale chips???Wait, wait, don't feel bad, after a long night of drinking I may still hit you up for a little brunch - I hear it's cheap. Great eye-candy while you eat and drink a margy or a coldy. The crowds can be a little too much but it's a bar first folks... so we must deal. The service is pretty good once you get a seat in the bar/lounge area. But trying to muscle up to the bar to order a drink is a biyaatch... unless you're a lady of course but that's how it goes at any busy bar.Tacos are ok... love the habanero chicken enchilida. It packs some heat baby! Chips, salsa &amp; guac are pretty good too. Gone for breakfast a few times but can't report as they weren't memorable. Prolly hung over each time. Three words: Happy Hour Breakfast.Three more words: Chicken Fried Steak!Good coffee and bitchy waitresses. Code for heaven.Here I come, Peso's... That's right. 5 stars. Read it and weep tears of joy. Especially if you're a designated driver.I'm not going to get into the killer food, like the hang-over breakfast they serve on Sundays, the tasty salsa, the perfect tacos carbon, the awesome burritos. Regardless of how good it is, I've heard people bitch about the food. Well, what do they know. We're a couple thousand miles from Mexico up here. The same people love Taco Time. I rest my case.Or the funny/cool decor. Love the wrought-iron window coverings. I could stare at that shit for hours. Or at least until I'm sober again. Or when I finally realize there's a homeless guy humping my leg.Sangria in a pitcher always makes my female companions happy. Pacifico always makes me happy. Ask me about the film I co-produced in East L.A. some time, I'll tell ya why.But here's what really does it for me: I walk up to the bar, I let the bartender know I'm driving, and he hands me a coke and a smile, on the house. He refills it when I finish, on the house.Thanks dude. I love it when a bartender recognizes that soda is essentially free, and will hook up the drivers trying to stay sober amongst their inebriated brethren. My bf and I were to attend an event at the Olympic Sculpture Park as part of some culture event for some music whatever, but we were both exhausted and opted instead to grab dinner at Peso's. I've never been to the restaurant, and really how can you go wrong with Mexican food? That was a rhetorical question, like when you ask "your child is beautiful; when did you adopt?"I was surprised by the exterior of Peso's, I expected an entrance that did a better job of indicating the front door. Upon entrance, the restaurant interior is awash in warm gold walls and dark wood furniture. I immediately took notice of a staff that was comprised entirely of women selling their flowing hair and boobs pushed above any tolls taken by gravity. I may not want a side of chest with my burrito, but I'd bet drugs that every straight guy in the restaurant would take two or more.We were promptly greeted by a very charming young hostess who offered the bar for immediate seating if we didn't want to wait. If we weren't exhausted, then the loud music and even louder conversations would be tolerable. We chose to wait ten minutes for a booth that offered us privacy and some shelter from the noise in the restaurant.Water was served promptly to our table, along with customary chips and salsa which was fresh and had just enough heat to make it dangerous. Our waitress took a little longer than what I would have preferred, but she was friendly and packing some serious guns out of her top.We ordered a carafe of the pomegranate sangria which arrived after our meals. I had high hopes for that sangria, I really did. The first reaction to what touched my tongue was "Kool-aid" followed by "fizz". My bf was quick to point out that we were served a drink made with more soda than brandy. At least we both had a maraschino cherry in our glasses. How fun is that? That wasn't a rhetorical question, the answer is, of course, it wasn't fun. Sangria should be strong, dark, and able to make a gay man want a bit of boob action.The beans are not veg*n, but the rice is. Factor that into a dairy-free diet and the enchiladas with mushrooms and corn come out of the kitchen as light fare in comparison to the portions served my bf. Don't get me wrong, the food was all right and my bf enjoyed his meal, but I had high expectations after hearing so many friends talk up this restaurant.I don't think I'll make another trip to Peso's unless I can bring my own sangria which is made with real ingredients, like booze. We decided to stop by Pesos to celebrate Cinco de Mayo with an early morning breakfast.. aclamaciones(cheers)!!! &#160;I was kind of surprised to see so many young people out so early in the morning, but it was Cinco de Mayo. They were pumping the tunes and it looked like they were getting ready for one busy day. I am not sure if they always play the music so loudly but I kind of felt like I was eating my breakfast burrito in a dance club, but again it was Cinco de Mayo. Service was prompt and we decided against ordering &#160;Mimosa but we should have maybe we would have had a better time there. My burrito was alright but it didn't seem like something I would want to have again. Again we left the place kind of feeling cheated because the food was just bland and kind of boring. I guess Pesos is more of a hang out than it is a restaurant.-------------------------------UPDATE 1-3-08Stop in for bfast again and god damn that was some tasty food!! Had the Peso's Eggs Benedict and I swear it was damn tasty. So adding another star now. I can't believe I haven't written a review of Peso's yet. This place is essential an institution for single people in Seattle; unfortunately that's not a compliment. The best quote I've heard of late regarding Peso's came from my roommate last night "it's a total sword fight in here".I'm going to create a list called "where to find single guys" and sell it to the single girls in Seattle. Peso's and Amber will certainly be near the top. It's always amazing to me when some of my girl friends say they can't find single guys in Seattle...just go here and I'm sure you'll go six for six (six date requests in six hours).The food is amazing at Peso's and that's the main reason I'm giving it three stars otherwise it'd be lower down the totem pole of my reviews. I highly recommend the Carne Asada. I love peso's....I love the foodI love the happy hourI love the musicI love that the restaurant is a different feel than the barI love that I don't know anybody in thereI love that the girls that work there think I am cuteI love that when I come here I get all of my fix's, seeing good friends, eye candy, and great food :) Some of the worst music I have ever heard in a meat-market setting. We just came for dinner but got the opportunity to observe the goings on. It made us kind of sad. But the food was relatively cheap and not bad, although not great. Was just looking for a place open late. It seemed popular enough though, I was wondering where that kind of crowd hung out in Seattle, now I know. I'm used to low key Ballard bars.My husband's review, "Decent food, fair price, but an endless parade of whores and douchebags." Here is what you need to know about Peso's:*On weekend nights it's packed with yuppie people in the bar and dining area. &#160;The food is great but not amazing since they're having to churn out so much so quickly. &#160;They still make great drinks no matter how busy they are.*The tapa's are perfect if you're looking for a quick bite/appetizer!*The happy hour breakfast (M-F 9:00-11:00 AM) is great and cheap!*Lunch is busy but not unmanageable and the food is great! &#160;Definitely try the skirt steak quesadillas! It's true, Peso's is a meat market - and not because they serve "amazing carne asada" according to my carnivorous compadres. There are a lot of scantily clad women and neanderthal men milling about.BUT, DON'T PASS UP PESO'S just because of that. If you come in the afternoon or early evening, you can bypass all of that madness.And the food is worth it. Surprisingly, they have an amazing breakfast (with "happy hour" prices on weekday mornings). Their happy hour menu is inventive, economical, and tasty. If you're a vegetarian, beware that the rice has chicken stock. As my new favorite waitress pointed out last time I was there. Yes, I'm a little upset about all those poor little chickens who had to die up until now. Instead, try the Green Chile Mole Nachos (yum!) or the Portabella Tacos.And for the love of all that's good, you must have one (or 5) of their pomegranate cosmos. Be prepared for heaven in a glass.pros: not your typical Mexican food; good prices for happy hour; great drinkscons: meat market atmos at night; crowded; too many TVs playing sports.p.s. Every waitress/hostess who works at Peso's is very pretty to look at, if you like that sort of thing. But, the real treat is the hottie bartender guy. Totally not my scene, but the pro's are there:*Great happy hour*Cute and friendly waitresses*Service is fast (though I avoid this place on weekends after 10p.m.)*Tasty foodCon's:Total pick up bar, and the guys that go there are the kind that I try desperately to avoid. Say what you will about Pesos, but it's almost always the place I end up eating/drinking when I am out and about in Queen Anne. Which might say something about my knowledge and frequency of hanging in the neighborhood, but let's be positive and assume it says something great about Pesos.I like the decor and ambiance, and I have always received good, friendly service. I really enjoy their margs and the $5 happy hour Ahi Poke Tostadas are muy delicioso. (See, I used Spanish there! Impressed? yeah) I also really like their brunch menu, but honestly I think I just enjoy brunch in general. As others have said, the sangria is a nice idea, but lacking in execution... where's the booze?!?! Stick where you're better acquainted (or at least where I'M better acquainted): tequila.Big downfall: the crowd is douche-y. You know it, I know it, but Pesos is still a fun space to grab a drink or snack as far as I'm concerned. Peso's!What can I tell ya other than I loved this place, but I also think that was due to a few factors. One, the company of my lovely accomplice in Brunch time madness, Elena, and two, the fact that she knew the bartender and he is funny as hell! Definitely enhanced my experience and overall impression of the place.As for the Bloody Mary I had, meh, it wasn't anything all that special and definitely needed a bit more kick. Wasn't bad, I just like my Bloody's to kick my ass a bit more. The meal I had was the Eggs Benedict with avocado and cheese, definitely tasty, but be warned that if you finish that whole plate you will need a serious nap afterward.Other than that, it's a lively place that you could easily waste an entire Sunday afternoon drinking at, but hey, there ain't nothin wrong with that! ;) I'm not quite sure how to review Pesos. &#160;I never had visited it until this last Saturday afternoon for lunch. &#160;I had previously had a very negative view of it because honestly, the people who stand outside that place after 11pm are complete douchebags who take up the sidewalk and don't care that you might want to walk past. &#160;They talk loud, shove each other (sometimes INTO me), and blow smoke all over. &#160;My boyfriend and I usually rolled our eyes as we passed because most of them are just plain rude. &#160;To me, this made me never have an interest in going to Pesos.However, I went there with my boyfriend and two of his friends on Saturday for lunch and I quite enjoyed it. &#160;I had the chicken quesadilla platter, which was delicious. &#160;The guacamole was fantastic and the quesadilla itself was very full and cooked perfectly. &#160;The salsa that comes with the complementary chips is also great. &#160;The service was really fast and our waitress was adorable and attentive.I still don't know how I feel about this place though. &#160;The lunch was great, but the attitude of the nightlife hugely turns me off. &#160;3 stars sounds about right. Anyone driving to Portland sometime soon? Could you possibly bring me a giant cooler (you know, like, gatorade-football-team-style) filled with Peso's sangria? It was like mother's milk to me back in 2003.I'd be much obliged.Oh, and slap some random frat guys' ass on the way out, eh?Thanks Happy Hour Breakfast. &#160;Need I say more? &#160;HAPPY HOUR breakfast, people!!! &#160;From 9am til 11am every weekday, Peso's offers a huge selection of breakfast items for $6 (nine dollars for the ones with seafood). &#160;I ordered the Grilled Eggsadilla; the Boy got the Crab Benedict. &#160;Both were yummy with very FRESH ingredients.Peso's, I forgive you for being all loud past midnight while I was trying to sleep over there across the street at the MarQueen. I eat at or walk by Pesos fairly regularly. There seems to be a lot of drama here. 1. People talking agitatedly and gesturing wildly. At their companions, or on the phone. Both inside the restaurant and out. In fact, the excitement on the sidewalk sometimes gets so intense that the poor pedestrians have to carefully pick their way through.2. Beautiful look-at-me! people. Both male and female, dressed more in Milan Chic than Seattle Casual. Strutting and working it. Almost always strategically seated in the front of the place because the staff aren't dummies!But that's not to say that I dislike Pesos - on the contrary, all the drama makes it interesting. The food itself is decent. It is loosely Mexican, and has strong, robust flavors. My fave is the Carnitas. The interior is also quite nice. It's obvious that they've spent some bucks on the place. I like the metal art. Lastly, the service is generally prompt, attentive and friendly.3 Stars - Visit for the drama.p.s. For those who care, the brewed coffee at Pesos is weak and flavorless. I haven't tried it myself, but I've seen people carry in those distinctive saffron-colored cups from across the street. It's the mexican restaurant for white people!Went here last night for dinner. The wait for a table was 20 minutos... no gracias! We sat in the bar.Music was pretty loud, happy hour was just ending so it was suuuper busy-town. Took about 10 minutes to get our house margaritas, but when we did, they were yummy in my stomacho (until later- but more on that to come- stick around).I ordered tomatillos enchiladas, and the boyfriend ordered red chile enchiladas (must have been in the mood for enchiladas?). They were bien, but I thought the rice tasted like poop (or rather, "mierda"). Got enough to take home and eat for dinner tonight (convenient!).Ordered another margarita. Strong little buggers! A bit too acidic for my tummy, which hurt for the next hour or two.No specials on drinks for Happy Hour, so if you're coming in for a drink, wait until the crowds diminish around 6:30-6:45.Oh yeah, and the waitresses are consistently bitchy. But like always I understand, because I would be bitchy too if I had to deal with the frat boys of America.*insert spanish phrase here (I can't think of one!)* boy do i have a thing for writing reviews for places with WAY TOO MANY reviews!! : )hola pesos!!very full restaurant: CHECKattentive service: CHECK CHECK!!food: the biggest burrito i've seen...

The place has great, unique food and you really can't go wrong with anything you order! &#160;This is an awesome spot if you're looking for a quick bite to eat and a cocktail, or even if you're in the mood to drink your face off... &#160;The staff is typically friendly and the drinks are strong, yet well made. &#160;And if you enjoy a morning cocktail, the breakfast margarita may become your new best friend.One thing to note, if you're annoyed by loud music, don't come here. &#160;They play some great music, but it can feel like you're at an f'ing dance club at 1 in the afternoon. &#160;I usually don't mind it, but sometimes it's just plain obnoxious. &#160;Aside from that, two thumbs way up! I would maybe give this place better reviews if I'd ever gotten enough attention to order food and eat there. &#160;The two times I've went, it was ridiculously busy and annoying and after being ignored, we ended up just getting up and leaving.Granted I am not a fan of the older versions of frat boys trying to scam on orange girls all night, but if that's your thing, then you should hit this place up.But I did really like the wrought iron and I'm sure it's tasty if they actually take your goddamn order. &#160;So I gave it a couple of stars. What to say...what to say....the food is excellent. &#160;I've had the seared Tuna and it was delicious!! &#160;It gets a little too crowded for taste however, even on a Thursday night. &#160;The convenient location and good food makes it a must visit...be prepared however to hunt for a table. &#160;The attitude of a crowd that's packed in that tight leaves something to be desired.... As a former Queen Anne resident, I usually find myself at Peso's at least once every couple of weeks. The service has always been outstanding; even a gay boy such as myself can enjoy the mass amounts of waitress eye-candy. The place looks fantastic, and parking isn't too difficult to find except maybe on a weekend evening. Now that that prattle is out of the way, let's get on to the food.Fan-freakin'-tastic. Honestly, Peso's is probably the best Mexican restaurant I've been to in terms of quality food. Actually, they take the number one spot in most other categories of service as well. Little touches, like black beans instead of refried and white cheddar cheese instead of that neon-orange dreck are pleasant departures from the "classic" Mexican-themed American restaurant. The only time I wouldn't try to go here for a meal is during the evening on the weekend... that's when you come to get plastered. In every way imaginable. I love love love Pesos' nachos. &#160;Their sour cream is to die for, I don't really know what they put in it but it's not normal sour cream. &#160;The place gets really packed, especially during happy hour so that can be really annoying. &#160;The last time I was there it took us 20 mins to get our tab and another 15 just for her to bring us our card back. &#160;Although, this was on an event night and I can understand how overwhelming it must be to have a bar full of 'The Boss' fans to tend to.Actually, come to think of it, every time I've been here I've had slow service... minus a star! Peso's is quite the haven for the younger, more uppity crowd, but i can't resist the happy hour. the hot sandwiches are like crack. thus far i've had the fish po boy and the steak. $6 ain't bad especially if it's late - they serve til 1 am. i am not too sure about the food, since i didn't have any. i came for the lounge portion of pesos. on day one of the rv trip, we happened to pick this place upon the a suggestion of a stranger. from the outside, i wouldn't have taken it for a lounge but just a restaurant.the hip hop music was awesome. i even got to do a little hustle. seattle boys are cute. the bartenders were attentive &amp; quick. also, surprise on the late night eats. I've heard great things about this place prior to visiting Seattle and this may, undoubtedly, be an unpopular review. We decided to go there since it was a skip and hop away from our hotel and it would be the last stop of the night's booze crusade. We arrived a few moments before their late night happy hour would start and was greeted by a, what I can only deduce, as a girl who hated the world. I don't know when she decided she would dislike us but she was sure firm in her decision. I'm not even really a big fan of places that claim happy hour and have no drink specials but I thought 'when in Seattle.' In short, the service was lacking and could use a little TLC. The food was quite tasty, however, and I would try it again on a return trip though not under the pretense of late night happy hour--oh, thou art misleading. I can only afford to eat out three times a week.One of those times will certainly be at Pesos.*It will be a sunday*we will have a waitress who is dumb *we will call ahead of time to make a reservation as there will be, there will be a 20 minute wait at least*we will have either the biscuits &amp; gravey, potato hash, chicken fried steak, eggsadillos or one of the benadicts.*the bill will come out to 25 dollarsish post tip*it will be absolutely deliciousI always bring friends from out of town to this place. &#160;I boast 'the best breakfast in seattle.' &#160;When I move, this will be one of the places I miss the most- the taste will be really hard to find again. The lobster eggs benedict is the best on the planet and the service is the worst. They have cute lights and the best jam for toast. If the manager put in a friendlier wait staff, I would be there all the time. This is a happening place with great ambience and decor. &#160;As the name suggests the dining and lounge area divide the place in two but it's great being on either side. &#160;I think I'll always remember this place for it's deep fried chicken dish - so GOOD! I'd like to do two separate reviews for this place. &#160;One for breakfast and one for lunch. &#160;They have a breakfast happy hour btwn 9 &amp; 11weekdays that's a deal. &#160; &#160;Big b fast good quality and selection. &#160;I think the b fasts run from 6-7 bones during this time. &#160;Went there for lunch and it just made my &#160;Mexican mediocre mark. &#160;Sonya's review of the annoying people out front of this place is dead on. &#160;Is it a nightclub at night? The happy hour menu isn't actually that great of a deal, except for the burger, which is. &#160;However, the happy hour food isn't really supposed to be a meal anyway, but just snacks to nibble on... like tapas. &#160;And from what I've had so far, it all tastes pretty good. I really like the energy of Pesos. I love their fajitas! It's kind of a meat market but I just love the decor and the people watching. I always look forward to going to Pesos. I ate at Peso's last night, and there was absolutely nothing wrong with it. However, there was nothing spectacular or memorable about it either. I had the Avocado, Lime and Chicken soup, and a seared scallop dish on a bed of orzo creamed corn with a tomatillo sauce (I don't see it on the menu online, so I'm not positive of the name, it was the only dish they had with scallops.) The soup was bland, and not just a little bland, it pretty much tasted exactly how chopped up tomatoes, diced chicken, pieces of avocado and a wedge of lime would taste in a bowl of water that was topped with cilantro sounds like it would taste. Salt helped some, but not enough. The scallops were overcooked, but all the sides had good flavor. &#160;Their salsa is really tasty, with a nice fire roasted tomato and pepper flavor, good fresh onions and cilantro. The boyfriend loved his prawns wrapped in bacon, and his buttermilk-thyme fried chicken with spicy jalepeno corn gravy. He even liked the green beans, and I have to say it was one of the first times I've ever seen green veggies go voluntarily into his mouth. I don't think I'd go back for me, but if he wants to eat there again sometime I'll give them another shot. Go for breakfast. In my opinion, its not really a Mexican joint or taco bar. I thought it was overpriced for a lunch burrito. Still, the breakfast is very good- the gravy! Beware on mornings of major sports events. It's a definite hub to gather and cheer along. The youthful service staff is cool, but don't expect service like Lola's of course. I was gonna give a three star and then I thought about their breakfast. &#160;Serivce is mediocre, it's an aweful place at night: Loud and obnoxious. &#160;But, if you want good Mexican breakfast, Peso's has it down. &#160;They definitely get pretty creative with their breakfast there, incorporating Mexican flavors with standard American breakfast. &#160;From Carne Asada and eggs to Jalepeno sausage eggs benedict. &#160;Oh, great weekend Bloody Mary. My husband and I celebrate our when-we-started-dating anniversary here. &#160;Why, you might ask? &#160;Yes, that's right, this lovely meat market is where my husband-to-be picked me up. &#160;To our credit, it was within walking distance from each of our apartments, we were both out with a very unsingle friend each just to get a quick bite/drink, and we're not your typical meat marketeers - we are science nerds. &#160;Amen. &#160;So, how could I give our meeting place any less than 4 stars? &#160;To Peso's credit, other (very true and negative) reviews aside, their margaritas are tasty, their green enchiladas always hit the spot, and their breakfast isn't like any other in Seattle. &#160;Tengo gusto de el! Peso's.......Heres the good:My boyfriend and I go there on a semi-regular basis. &#160;For the most part we really like the joint- there are lots of candles and super cool metal and glass artwork. It is very aesthetically appealing. &#160;As for the food, it is superb! My bf is especially obsessed with the steak burrito and I like the chicken, avocado, and lime soup lots. And the bad:The clientele, especially in the late evenings, can be really annoying. How, you ask? Well.....the women are especially yuppie: overdressed, loud, shallow, and really dumb. The men I am not sure of. &#160;While I wouldn't rate it as meat market status, after 10, you're getting close. The other thing is that the waitresses can be bitchy, and like to show off their boobies. How classy. (well, there is one exception- I don't know her name but &#160;she actually looks professional instead of &#160;ridiculous and is very nice. )All in all, a great place for the atmosphere and food, but not so hot for service or finding the next nominee for the Nobel Peace. (or just a person with more brains than a perfume bottle.) I've been to Pesos several times since I live literally 2 minutes away. &#160;If you are lucky enough to get there early and grab a table then you'll have a much better time than standing elbow to elbow in the crowd. &#160;You'll find the crowd much more tame on a weekday than a weekend, however I have to gripe about one recent friday night when a group of girls and I were waiting out in the freezing cold to come inside. &#160;Too bad we didn't know the bouncer. &#160;The bouncer allowed a group of his friends to cut in front of us while we continued to wait and wait in the cold, yes freezing cold! &#160;We thought maybe he forgot we were standing there so we reminded him of our presence at which point he claimed we had attitude which wasn't allowed at Pesos. &#160;Honestly we were not giving him any lip as his friends bypassed us in line and then he wanted to talk to us about Pesos attitude requirements. &#160;Confused, cold, and not thirsty enough to listen to this a-hole, we left. I think the bouncer mistakenly thought he was working VIP in Vegas at the Tryst night club where Paris Hilton was slated to show up. &#160;He definitely needed a reality check of the Mexican pub he was door sitting. &#160;Its too bad this incident went down because it is the only bad experience I've ever had at Pesos but it still warranted a YELP. &#160;Long story short please watch out for the bad ass Friday night door sitter. Best happy hour food. Steak Quesadilla/Hamburger. Awesome! busy meat market type atmosphere. i would only go for the happy hour from 10-1 but even that isn't so great .. i guess it's good for late night dining, thats about it. Pesos used to be my favorite bar. Good location, good music playlist, hot waitresses, good food (especially their happy hour menu). But I have had so many bad experiences there that I have vowed to stop giving them my business. For one the waitresses being hot somehow gives them the impression that they can be terrible servers and get away with it. But mainly I have had bad experiences with the bartenders. Let me tell you about my last experience. I went in on a Sunday at about 4:30 to order some chips &amp; salsa to go. The bar or restaurant were not busy. But I was told that they don't do chips &amp; salsa to go by the bartender (Josh is his name, the worst of them all). I have done this numerous times before and told him this. He proceded to give me high levels of attitude and finally put in my order. 15 minutes later I get my order (which costed $3.50) and the chips were scarce to say the least. It was not enough for my girlfriend and I to snack on. I had to go down the street to Jalisco's to order more chips. They brought out a luch size brown bag full of chips within a couple of minutes and didn't even charge me for them. So if it is even DECENT service you are looking for, don't go to Pesos.
I had been wanting to try this place for a while so i went in for a late Sunday lunch (about 1:15pm). &#160; &#160;The decor is pleasant with orange-peach sponge painted walls. &#160;Of particular note are the photographs: lots of early 20th century B&amp;W pictures from Bangkok. &#160;However, I was seated in the lower dinning room and the aucustics in the room are terrible... When I first arrived, there were two other tables being occupied. &#160;The conversations from those tables was almost as though I was seated their... &#160;Even as 3 more tables became filled, it was as though I was sitting at each table. &#160;There is a smaller dinning area that might be a little more quite. &#160;But certainly, in the big dinning room don't talk about the bedroom or anything else you don't want people to hear.I was seated fairly promptly, but as it got busier the waiter had a harder time keeping up with tables. &#160;And he never scanned the room so when I was ready for my check, I was unable to get his attention for about 5 mins.One oddity is the water: They add lemon to it, but it gave the water a weird chlorine flavor. &#160;I asked for water without lemon and that was much better.For food, I went the Roti with curry/potato sauce for an appetizer and the Avocado Curry with chicken with 3 star spiciness on a 4 star scale.I had not had Roti before, so I am not sure what constitutes good Asian pan cakes. &#160;However, I found the sweet curry sauce to be nice though the Roti was "greasy". &#160; Still, I like the texture and the flavor but it wasn't anything special.The Avocado curry had a nicely balanced flavor to it, but I was expecting it to be a little more spicy than it was. &#160;Again, it was good, but nothing stood out about it particularly since it was listed in the house specialty section of the menu.My rating over all is this isn't a bad place but there was nothing in my experience that made it stand out like the closer Tim Tup Thai and even Puckett which are more convenient Thai restaurants for me to go to. &#160;The service was bad nor was it outstanding, the food wasn't bad but again, it wasn't not outstanding... and the ambiance wasn't terrible but was distracting as noted above. While walking in the neighborhood, my husband and I dropped into this restaurant, hoping that we would have a nice service and good food. We have got neither, nor. We often go to different restaurants in Seattle but we have never waited for so long for the waiter to notice us, then to take our very simple order, and then another 20 minutes to receive it. I cannot take any spicy food and I asked specifically not to make my rice spicy which the waiter said wouldn't be a problem. Of course, the rice was spicy and the soup which came together with rice was almost cold. The waiter never checked on us, and we had to wait for a bill as well. The place doesn't look clean, there is a lot of garbage on the floor, especially close to their restrooms and around the kitchen. The waiters produce a lot of motions but they are not efficient at all. When we finally left the place, we said to each other, "NEVER Again". Went here a few months ago. &#160;It was pretty good. &#160;Just glad to be seated right away, bf the Buble concert. &#160;Get the Zion chicken. &#160;If I find myself back, I'd like to try the pumpkin curry. &#160;But in the neighborhood, Racha will always have my heart. &#160;:-) I was hankering for some thai food but was unwilling to leave my house after traveling all week. I remembered passing this place and thought I would give it a try and get it delivered. The woman I spoke to on the phone was pleasant and spoke English well. She asked me for my address and phone number. Then said it would be 15-20 minutes, which I thought was unusually quick. I ordered the chicken panag curry and tofu phad see iew. The delivery made it in 45 minutes, which is much more typical. The food was hot and tasty. I would order from here again. This used to be pretty reliable for us to order carry out. Our favorites were the special green beans and the garlic lovers dish. &#160;The other Thai place on Upper Queen Anne has a delivery surcharge, which is a bit outdated since we aren't in a gas crisis. &#160;But I digress. &#160;We used to rely on Rice N Spice because the food was fairly standard and delivery quick enough.I'm not sure how a Thai restaurant in a town that is so Thai crazy can screw up a basic dish like Pad Thai. &#160;Recently they showed us how it is possible- ours tasted like ketchup was added. &#160;I thought something like that went out in the 90's, since people are fairly sophisticated about their pad thai. &#160;I tried to ignore it but even hubby detected it and asked me if I was okay with it. &#160;Nope. &#160;This is not even acceptable. That is an abomination.Looks like I'll be paying that surcharge to get Thai food delivered from their competitor. &#160;Sure I can order other dishes from Rice N Spice, but a basic and ubiquitous dish like this should be up to par. &#160;If you take shortcuts with something so standard, what other tricks can be played with the rest of the menu? &#160;I'm not about to pay to find out. I found the ambiance odd. There was little to no music playing and the place was very silent for a late lunch. HOWEVER, I had the cashew chicken and was really enjoyed it, more so than most Thai food I have had outside of Thailand. Can't speak to many of their other dishes just a few bites and they too were good, I enjoyed the food, though the restaurant was a bit strangely decorated and the stairs and hallway to the bathroom offered some not-so-great behind the scenes tour. This is my favorite Thai place. &#160;I usually can't stand tofu but they even make tofu taste good. &#160;My wife is fanatical about their pad thai, and I love their pan-nang curry, extra spicy with brown rice.The day before our wedding we had family with us from all over and everyone loved it. &#160;Superb amount and quality for what you pay.All of the appetizers are good. &#160;I have never tried a menu item I didn't like. &#160;The service is VERY fast. &#160;I lived in Queen Anne for three years and this is probably one of the top three places to eat in the area. We were in Seattle the first week of April 2010, starving, and looking for a place to eat. &#160;We were staying in the area, and had walked around the park surrounding the Space Needle looking for some place to eat (all of the restaurants surrounding the SN were closed except for McDonald's and of course the over-hyped and too-expensive for what you get SN Restaurant...WTF Seattle?).We ended up at Rice &amp; Spice against the protestations of my son who doesn't like to try anything new. &#160;We ordered the red curry (level 2 spice), the beef short ribs with broccoli (level 2 spice) and my son ordered something with scallops and shrimp (I forget what it was called - level 2 spice). I'm not a fan of curry or coconut milk, but I did try the curry. &#160;Neither my son nor I liked it, but I think that was just personal preference because my mom (who ordered it) liked it a lot. &#160;The short ribs were good, and the broccoli was cooked to perfection - not too soft, not raw. &#160;The scallop and shrimp thing that my son ordered was good, and the scallops were cooked well.When we got there, we were the only customers in the place, but as we were eating, a couple of other tables were filled. &#160;The servers kept our drinks filled, which was good because level 2 spice was just spicy enough to make us drink a lot of water. &#160;They lit little candles all over the place and it was really cozy and nice inside. &#160;There was a bar that looked well-stocked, but we didn't drink anything.Overall, a nice place to eat and even my son left full and happy and with a renewed vow to try new things. Cardinal sin: they use ketchup to flavor the phat thai. If you see red phat thai, you know a restaurant is catering to a perception of "American" (sweet and not spicy) tastes. The 4-star hotness was a 1-star anyplace else. The red curry was watery, and the fried tofu in it was unpleasantly squishy. If this was food at a friend's house, I'd give good marks for effort. But this is a restaurant creating food without the strong flavors that make Thai food so wonderful. I can't recommend this restaurant. Aaaalright, so I know I am a Thai food snob, and should probably hate this place, but I don't! The food is actually pretty decent! The Pad See Ew (my FAVORITE Thai dish) has only been sub-par once in the ten or twelve times I've eaten it. The Crab Rangoons are FREAKING awesome. The Crying Tiger is truly delicious, definitely their standout dish. The pad Thai is good. The Tom Yum Goong is well balanced between sweet, sour, and salty. The service is quick, they're polite. I kinda hate when Thai restaurants push the option of rice and then it's like $3, which can confuse anyone who's not a Thai food regular. They ask about rice, like, four times during the ordering process.They've also kind of sweetened the deal by being located 1 block from my apartment. They're not the best Thai in the city, but Rice N Spice is good for having the letter N in the middle of their name, as opposed to springing for the who "and". If you're in the area, I'd say go for it! Not very good at all.I ordered 3 items for delivery and it took about 45 mintues, which isn't a big deal other than all of the items were cold and the orange chicken was totally soggy, so it seemed like they sat around quite awhile before being delivered.Again, the orange chicken was soggy (imagine fried chicken breading left to sit in a sauce for an hour) so it was a total waste of money as I could only pick the veggies out and had to toss the chicken. &#160;The fried rice has hardly any flavor at all and there were no tomatoes or egg in it (the menu said the fried rice had those in it) so I took the sauce from the orange chicken and poured it on it to give it some flavor, &#160;The Crying Tiger beef was chewy and the sauce was sweet and I just didn't like it very much, Even though I asked for 3.5 stars on everything, none of the items had very little if any spice at all.All &amp; all, waste of $30 and pretty disappointing.
Great food. Lunch specials are filling and cheap. Good service. The waitress was friendly and not annoying. Can be busy during lunchtime. :(I highly recommend their chicken chimichanga. Crispy, not greasy, and full of chicken-y goodness. Chips and salsa is fresh!!!Can be crowded. Went with some coworkers and we were a little cramped in there. Order the Huevos Rancheros. It's always good. Or the fajitas and margaritas. Kinda slow, inattentive &amp; overpriced for this locale. While always accommodating, they could use a makeover both in staff, menu &amp; decor.
They Weren't participating in Veterans Day free six inch. &#160;The lady there didn't even know what Veterans Day was. &#160;Thumbs down.
we went there on Monday morning. 50% restaurant full. food is so so70's decor. service is not too bad.
Popular with the usual suspects, or so I've been told. &#160;Hence the name....
Don't make the mistake of ordering the veggie pad thai with tofu. &#160;It's either veggie pad thai OR it's pad thai with tofu. &#160;It cannot...(and apparently MUST NOT) be both. &#160;Do not invite the ire of your server. &#160;Your water glass will remain empty, and you will be shivering with dehydration by the front door no one ever closes.Quick, efficient hole in the wall...tasty and rather cheap. &#160;You get a good discount for utilizing your cash instead of your debit card, so do so if possible. Love going here for lunch - lunches are about seven dollars a dish and are great! &#160;I always get the veggie phad kee mao (sp?) and the fresh rolls are always a hit with every group. They come with a warm peanut sauce that is amazing. They have a large veggie portion of the menu. I have never been there with anyone that didn't love it. GO HERE! Basil chicken eff tee dub. Low key environment, bathroom is not particularly appealing... Would cost a star, but it is part of the aesthetic of the restaurant. good stuff. Super cheap, quick tasty lunch. Garlic chicken was just garlic-y enough without fear of killing my coworkers with my breath. Decent portion for the super cheap price. Got in and sat at a table in the corner by noon and the place was packed by 12:15-12:3-, so I would say get there a bit early. Will definitely go back for takeout as well. Please do not eat here. Mae Phim's food, service and prices used to be great - I have been a loyal patron for seven years - but has recently lost all sense of quality. They no longer take pride in their product or service, and should not be allowed to serve cold, inconstant food (often times with alien objects in it) to people that want edible, delicious food. Well, tried this place one day out of convenience and a craving for pad thai. The place is a little crammed and while it seems like most people carry out, you can sit and there is wait service to take your order...As for the food, the pad thai was weird (not horrible at first because I ordered a side of peanut sauce and ended up utilizing most of it to mask the weirdness). About an hour later I had the most horrible stomach pains and felt so naseated I didn't even want to drink water. Later, my co-worker warned me NEVER to go (duh, like I really would after feeling like that?) because he once saw cockroaches!! &#160;Eeeek! Save yourself and walk around to the other side of the building on Marion and try out Ferry Noodle House.
Pizza is not done properly here. SIGH.Besides CPK, this is the only place in Northgate Mall to get a slice of pizza. &#160;Sad. &#160;Get a Pagliacci over here, pronto! &#160;I've only come here once, and only once. &#160;I ordered a slice of Hawaiian pizza, a huge slice might I say. &#160;The cashier wasn't very friendly. &#160;I was moving my pizza across the counter, and some of it flopped onto the counter. &#160;She laughed obnoxiously, and gave me a weird look. &#160;UNACCEPTABLE.Anyway, onto the pie. &#160;I took a bite of the pizza, and was less that satisfied. &#160;It wasn't good. &#160;The crust was too doughy and soft. &#160;The cheese wasn't melted well, only the front maybe. &#160;The ham was too salty, pineapple was too mushy.Never again. For anyone whose ordered pizza at a Sbarro, you know the routine: &#160;you tell them what pizza you want, they take it from the counter, warm it in the pizza oven, you get your drink and pay, and by then the pizza is crisp and warm and handed to you. &#160;Good deal.In the past few weeks, this location now has a microwave oven they're using to rewarm the pizza instead of the main pizza oven. &#160;GROSS! &#160;If I wanted nuked pizza, I'd get some from...wait - I DON'T want nuked pizza, especially for 4 bucks a slice. &#160;Also, check out their drink prices. &#160;I believe a small soda is $2.19. &#160;The Panda Express next door is $1.40 for a similar drink and the Baskin Robbins two shops down has a 16 oz drink for $0.99. &#160;It pays to shop around!
After I eat here I wish I could gargle with Drano. &#160;Ever notice how McDonalds food leaves some kind of lingering film in your mouth. &#160;Kinda like when you get gasoline on your hands and can't wash off the smell. &#160;Never again will I go here! Worst experience I ever had! The sign outside offer "buy one Big Mac and get one free", but when I asked for my second burger I was told that I didn't qualify because I had bought the Big Mac "meal". The employee was haughty and rude. I asked to speak to the Manager and she got very loud, argumentative and very rude with me in front of the other customers. I ask why I wasn't informed of the details of the promo before i purchased the meal. She said it was not their responsibility. She refused to honor their posted promotion. It was the worst Customer Service I ever saw at any McDonald's... I will never go there again!
What a cool, little, hip joint nestled in the Eastlake neighborhood. I can't say enough good things about it: the food.. excellent, the service.. awesome, the wine selection.. incredible, the parking.. meh, could be better (as with all fine restaurants in Seattle). From personal experience I have this love-hate relationship with the bar. I want it to be bigger so I can always have a seat when I get there but keep it nice and intimate.Ask Matt for a wine recommendation and if you're lucky you just might get John to come out and give you a little history of the delectable food and wine you're about to partake in. Had happy-hour and then dinner on a Tuesday.Our server was excellent.Mom-in-law had to send back her coffee, and Wife had to have her Martini remade (does it run in the family?).The happy-hour poo-poos were good, and I had the Melanzane Alla Serafina and I was very happy.The place was buzzing by 630p.I would go again if in the hood.Oh, street parking is hellish. I came here for the 25 for 25... it was ok... the atmosphere was nice and romantic. The food was kinda boring and a little bland. &#160;If I lived nearby, I would eat here every so often... but I definitely wouldn't drive out of my way for this place.
One of the best Phillies in the city. Service is meh, atmosphere is less so. But when you are serving up a sandwich like this they can probably get away with it. Sandwich is a little pricey but worth the experience. Grab a couple to go and enjoy them in a park. This sandwich is bomb! &#160;Super friendly! &#160;I'll be back.
My work just ordered from them for a lunch meeting. I noticed because I saw the Ingallina's boxes by our freight elevator for recycle and thought: "Ooo, Inga's great stuff! Time for my review!"=) Good stuff.
3 stars for the chips and salsa. &#160;Not sure of the draw but maybe it just wasn't pour moi. &#160;Definitely a crowd in there and it's been around a long time despite lots of development in the neighborhood. &#160;For what it is, could be cheaper. Painfully bland, generic mexican food. Nothing horrible, but certainly nothing special - especially for the prices they're asking. Homemade tamales and tall margaritas make El Gallito a cock-a-doodle yummy destination if you happen to be on the eastern side of town. &#160;It has lost some of its seedy charm in the recent expansion from microscopic cinderblock hut to merely small digs. &#160;The green chile dishes are heavy on the black pepper. &#160; It would be better if they stepped away from the Azteca formula of drippy beans and spanish rice, but it's still good.
This is my go-to for when I am too lazy to cook. Like most thai places they do some things better then others.The Fried Rice is is a staple and the Nuea Namtok is good for a light dinner for me. Thai Heaven no more. &#160;In recent years Thai Purgatory has been more apt. &#160;I remember back in the day when Denny opened Thai Heaven. &#160;It was good. &#160;I wonder now if we were so grateful for this bit of Asian cuisine in the hood we over rated it? Our first trip toThailand was still ahead of us. &#160;Years later, 6 other Thai spots within a mile, and some Thailand trips behind us, we can no longer recommend this place. &#160;The food has gotten sloppy, poorly prepared, poorly presented. &#160;This week one pork dish was a mess all in beige. &#160;Another had some color and they forgot the flavor. &#160;Asking for the traditional pepper condiments, we had a water glass full of red pepper flakes placed on the table. &#160;The vinyl backs on the booths are falling apart, walls need painting, the food is lackluster. &#160;Thai Heaven has been closed the past few weeks. We had hoped the opening of the Gates Foundation a few blocks away was the incentive needed for refurbishing and sharpening the menu. &#160;Not so. As our waiter told us, just closed for vacation. &#160;Too bad. &#160;They missed an opportunity to get back in the game with these new customers. &#160;Purgatory is that state between death and the final resting place with a chance for redemptive change. &#160;It is time for the final judgement and there has been no redemption.
Sh_t. Stilly only in Saigon. &#160; &#160; &#160;Martin Sheen as Sgt Willard, Apocalpyse NowIf he'd been able to find Banh Mi and other Vietnamese Deli food as good as this in Saigon Sgt Willard, would never have gone up River to find Colonel Kurtz. Heck if he'd brought a few of the combination sandwiches and couple of spring rolls with him, Kurtz might have given up his evil empire. Huong Xua is an inexpensive flavor getaway, a true gem in an underutilized part of the city. I tag it with four Yelp stars, which translates to VERY GOOD or "I would eat there anytime." The Vietnamese sandwich, or bahn mi, is the founder of Huang Xua's feast. While there are a couple solid shops in the vicinity Huong Xua is the best. With the ridiculous price of $2.00 to $2.50 a bahn mi is generally offered pre-made, wrapped in parchment paper and propped at the front of a pho joint or Vietnamese bakery. A proper bahn mi is a full meal. It begins with a fresh French "sub-roll" approximately a foot long. Crispy on the outside soft and fluffy on the inside the bun itself is top-notch. However, the adventure is the fillings. Huong Xua offers 6 made-to-order varieties. I get the classic combination which is really never the same sandwich twice. The classic bahn mi offered at Huong Xue consists of Vietnamese sausage, pate, various other mystery meats, sliced daikon, shaved carrots, jalape&#241;os and cilantro (Fairness in Hating Cilantro Act - I pick it off). Each bite is completely different. Some bites are spicy, some are fresh and crispy and some bites are loaded with rarely offered fantastic mineral/earthy flavors. Needless to say this is not a Subway classic combo. If you are not in the mood for a true flavor-escape I can vouch for the BBQed pork bahn mi which is very good and far more familiar to the Western pallet. Huang Xua also has a number of pre-made plates of Vietnamese dishes nestled near the cash register. The plates are set at similarly low prices and while I have not tried them all, they look great and locals are constantly ordering them. There are also a number of Asian drinks in the cooler and many other treats scattered around the deli which I encourage others to try and please report back on.The one slight draw-back with Huong Xue (9629 16th Ave SW Seattle, WA 98106, in the heart of White Center) is that seating is extremely limited. Further, while I feel comfortable in the neighborhood, the mix of run down bars, porno shops, pho spots and Vietnamese delis is not run-of-the-mill. However, I have had bahn mi in Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sacramento - all cities with strong Hmong and Vietnamese populations. As such, I can affirmatively state that in order to get a proper bahn mi for an honest price one must venture off the beaten path. In the case of Huong Xue those in search of a low cost taste vacation will not be disappointed.
I like a Good sandwich! This joint has been puttin out good product for years. I like the number 1 Italian sub. This full size sandwich is 6 bucks and makes the sandwich franchises taste awfull!(except you jimmy john). The owners are nice and friendly which means alot since sometimes you need a bullet proof vest to walk in the joint! Or maybe thats just me....
The sandwhich I had was ok. The cake that I had was amazing.
When someone first told me about Magic Dragon, I thought it was a joke. The name itself is just too ridiculous to be believable. A Chinese fast food restaurant called Magic Dragon sounds like something out of a sitcom. This one has the added bonus of being located in a relatively new strip mall in the Central District.The space is clean, the steam tray options had good variety, and the lady who worked there was tolerably friendly. I ordered the 2-entree combo which comes with fried rice and chow mein for $7. Huge portions is one of the advertised points of Magic Dragon and I have to agree. That meal could have fed three people. The noodles in the chow mein were overcooked but it was seasoned well. The mongolian beef wasn't the best in texture but the flavors were good. The fried rice is mediocre, I'd ask next time to see if I can substitute more chow mein instead. The General Tso's chicken is nothing to write home about; the pieces of chicken had a nice amount of meat but the coating was so mealy and soft. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but I am glad I have now satisfied my curiosity about Magic Dragon.
Our office loves pho but usually has to head across the Ballard bridge to get it. &#160;This was our first time trying Time 4 Pho, and we were impressed. &#160;We tried their rare steak, chicken and veggie/tofu soup.The dining room is clean and has 2 large TVs. &#160;The service is friendly and fast enough. &#160;They have a self-serve bar for the extra goodies like cilantro, jalepenos, sprouts, etc. Finally -- good pho in Magnolia/Interbay!We will definitely be going there again. Finally! I've been walking by their "Coming Soon" sign for so long, and at last the time has come.I went there when they opened on Monday (3/31), and grabbed some takeout. We each had the Bo Tai and an order of chicken vermicelli to share (I intended to have leftovers, but those plans were foiled by my husband leaving it out overnight and the cat eating all the remaining chicken - he gave it two paws up, though). The Pho was good - the portions were a bit smaller for the price than someplace like Than Brothers, but the flavors were good. The chicken vermicelli was very tasty - the chicken was delicious and the cold noodles were refreshing.The inside of the restaurant is super cute - they have some walls painted a bright cheerful green, with matching chopsticks at the table. The fixings for the Pho are in a little buffet, and you can take what you want (the gave me a little baggie to load up for my takeout). The food was a little slow, but they were very nice and I am going to assume they're still getting the kinks out for opening day (and I'll probably call ahead next time, now that I have a menu). I would definitely eat in, too - the restaurant is way nicer inside than your typical hole in the wall pho joint (not that I'm knocking holes in the wall, but a little pleasing decor never hurts).Super bonus points for taking plastic - I never carry cash, and am always annoyed by having to go to the bank just to get takeout.UPDATE: Had takeout again, and ate in the restaurant once. Chicken teriyaki is really good. Service is still super friendly. Bumping up to 5 stars. This place is da bomb!!! I couldnt wait for this place to open and when they did, they did not dissapoint. &#160;The pho is the the bees knees. I love the condiment bar, some places get stingy with that stuff. &#160;The eggrolls are awesome too. My boyfriend loves them! &#160;I have had the pho tai several times now, and its so good. I love how they slice the meat really thinly. &#160;Some places it is too thick and I like it to be more tender. &#160;I have also tried the teriyaki and beef short ribs, both very good. &#160;Service was quick and friendly. Two thumbs up for this place. We've been twice, now - and both times have had the vegetarian pho with tofu. &#160;The broth is flavorful and delicious - salty, just the way I like it. &#160;The prices are decent enough and the condiment bar is a fantastic idea for those of us who are picky about what we put into our dish. &#160;I love that I can pile on the bean sprouts but leave the leafy greens for someone who will appreciate them. I look forward to many more trips and the opportunity to try items from the rest of the menu.The atmosphere is clean and crisp. &#160;There are two large televisions sets, both times showing the golf channel.Service is friendly, though they aren't as fast as other pho joints I've been to, but they also have only one person working the kitchen, so I can understand if that's the reason for it.Overall, I thought the food was quality and would definitely head back again. &#160;It's nice to have another restaurant option in Magnolia.Also noteworthy: they accept credit cards.
The Crab Spring rolls were absolutely amazing! Andrea was a terrific wait person, I'd ask for her next time. I had fresh Alaska Halibut, which was cooked perfectly. A nice sauce to set it off, it really let the fish be the star of the show. The sommelier recommended a great Oregon Viognier, which complemented the meal nicely. My wife had the Ling Cog, it looked fantastic, but she was disappointed in how bland the dish turned out to be.Be sure to ask for a window seat if possible; also, lots of families with small children were here, so if you are looking for romantic intimacy, this may not always present that type of atmosphere. Lovely evening to be on the water. &#160;The location is typical Seattle on the water in Queen Anne. &#160;We had window seats which made the view that much better.We were greeted by the owner upon arrival. &#160;Nothing screams more than personal when you meet the actual owner. &#160;He asked us if we needed anything, and then came back to our table a few times to chat. &#160;My friend used to own a bar so we all talked about the industry and wine, food, etc. &#160;The food was delicious. &#160;I enjoyed every dish. &#160;We had Dungeness Crab Spring Rolls, Alder Smoked Pacific Black Cod, Grilled Leader Creek Sockeye Salmon, Tempura Nori Wrapped Ahi Tuna, Moelleux au Chocolate and Lemon tart.The Ahi was cooked to perfection and I enjoyed the coconut rice. &#160;The salmon was rare and moist. &#160;I enjoyed my dinner there and will be back. &#160;We were there for the 30 for $30 and unlike other participating restaurants Ponti allowed us to choose from the entire menu. For the hype and price of dishes, I give this restaurant 3 stars.Short Review:Pros:1) Beautiful atmosphere - good place to bring clients, date, or family.2) Fresh seafood3) Interesting spins on popular Seattle favorites - the chef tries to incorporate flavors from around the world that taste great.Cons: 1) Servers could stand to be a bit more relaxed and natural. &#160;Tense and scripted does not translate to professional.2) Soggy tartlett crust, soft brulee on creme brulee, and soggy tempura on prawn tempura.I can see how Ponti can get some very high review and some very low reviews. &#160;Our food was a bit inconsistent.Long Review (I got a bit carried away):I had a really nice dinner here. &#160;Our hostess was friendly but offered to seat us in the bar next to the fireplace. &#160;I thought this was a bit odd (did not want to sit there) and asked for another option. &#160;She sat us next to a corner window. &#160;It was beautiful and far better than our previous option. &#160;Moral of the story: don't settle.FoodDelicious! For STARTERS we had the chanterelle tartlet and prawn tempura. The tart tasted amazing and was full of flavor. &#160;The only problem was the tart shell itself was soggy. &#160;I'm assuming that it was assembled earlier that night and the oils from the cheese had seeped through. &#160;Bummer!Flavor wise the prawn tempura was nice. &#160;However, the batter again, was soggy. &#160; I was left with the conclusion that Ponti was having a rough night keeping things crispy.Our salmon and scallops for our SECOND COURSE were delicious as well! &#160;I had a generous, juicy amount of salmon on my plate. &#160;I love the taste of salmon and could not ignore the fact that it was drenched in butter. &#160;As delicious as butter is I was still a bit disappointed about that. &#160;Kudos on light char flavor. &#160;It really added a nice dimension to the dish.My boyfriends scallop dish was &#160;delicious. &#160;The scallops itself were simple and yummy. &#160;What really surprised me were the vegetable fritters that came with it. &#160;It looked and tasted like a carrot, potato mixture dipped in a batter. &#160;It was delicious and really SPICY! &#160;I loved it but felt that another customer might not have appreciated this.For DESSERT we ordered the trio of custards. &#160;I love desserts like this where you can sample different flavors. &#160;Our coffee flavored creme brulee was nice but the brulee part was soggy and not crunchy. &#160;I look forward to cracking that top layer so was a bit disappointed. &#160;The creme caramel was very dense and I couldn't help but notice the not so subtle egg flavor. &#160;I would love to try their Happy Hour. &#160;I think I'm going to check it our for sure when I take family to see Fremont. &#160;The Ponti HH would be a nice touch to end the day.Passport and Prime cards accepted here! Ponti is one of my favorite places for dinner considering the quality of the food and the beautiful location on the canal. During the Christmas season is especially pretty because many of the boats coming by are lit up with Christmas lights.I am surprised Ponti has several low reviews because I have not have a negative experience there. Yes, the service could use a little work sometimes but for the most part the servers are gracious and attentive. Last night I went for a company party and the experience was great. I had the organic green salad with almonds and blue cheese (good, pretty standard), the medium rare filet of beef tenderloin with garlic mashed potatoes (very very good) and the molten chocolate cake for dessert. I couldn't finish the cake because I was so full but it was rich and extremely decadent! Maybe not quite as good as the molten cake at Metropolitan Grill but still amazing. Having the dinner bill footed by the company was a plus, but normally the prices are on the higher side. Ponti is a special occasion restaurant, at least for me. Another aspect that impressed me about the catering was that the entree portions were quite big. My filet had to be around 8 oz. and the salmon filets served as another option were about twice as big as I would have expected. Very nice surprise!Tip: get valet parking. Parking around the Fremont Bridge is not worth the hassle and valet is only $2+ tip! We recently bought a groupon ($60 for $30) for this restaurant. We were seated at a windowside table with a view of the fremont bridge and the canal. We were greeted by our friendly server who was very meticulous in talking though the menu and making recommendations. We had the mango mint martini which was one of their signature cocktails. It was fruity but not alcoholic enough to make it a cocktail. We had pre-decided that we would order the dungenness crab spring rolls and oyster mushroom tartlet from the appetizer section. Trust me these dishes will not disappoint you. The spring rolls were juicy and the housemade sweet chili sauce was excellent. The mushroom tartlet was a bite of heaven in my mouth, had it been a tad warmer it would have been the perfect icing on the cake. Our server tried hard to sell us the thai curry penne which is the only dish that's been on their menu for the past 20 years. We were tempted at first but it was hard to pass off on fresh seafood that he also talked highly about. We eventually went with the pacific ling cod with toasted aioli and asparagus. The cod was cooked perfectly and was very tender and moist. The only pet peeve I had was that it had a smoky flavor to it which is really not an appealing taste for my palate. We ended with the trio of custards (espresso creme brulee, chocolate pot de creme, caramel flan). The espresso creme brulee was the hands down winner amongst the 3 choices. Our check (believe it or not) was exactly $60 which caught the server by pleasant surprise (as if it had all worked out according to the groupon plan!)I believe their happy hour is also a good value proposition since they offer their signature dishes at reduced prices. Definitely something worth checking out on our next visit there. They also offer a $20 gift certificate if you fill out your feedback which can be applied towards a special occasion. I go to Ponti about once every three months. &#160;If you are looking for an upscale place then that's what you get. &#160;The food is good and you'll pay for it. I like to go there and take my time with dinner and converse over a bottle of wine with friends. It makes for a very pleasant evening. &#160;Service is top notch and the food is perfectly cooked. &#160;If you know you want some good seafood then they won't let you down. &#160;Just remember you pay for what you get. Ponti has always met my expectations, with one exception: need fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Other than that, I am a fan of the specialty drink menu and the food. The service has always been pleasant. I do enjoy the atmosphere. I keep coming back. This was the first restaurant I ate at in Seattle 11 years ago, when I moved here. I remember fresh flavors, and friendly service. It was a favorite place of mine for quite some time. I think the only reason I stopped going was change of address in the city and I started branching out and trying new fun places for food and atmosphere. Fast forward a decade or so to a snow day in November. My boyfriend and I now live down the street and had been meaning to stop in for many months. My boss really likes the bartender and has nothing but good things to say. We also couldn't drive anywhere so we decided to walk down and enjoy some food and drink with this great bartender of Ponti. Mistake. Maybe I should have dropped my bosses name and then the service would have been better. He wasn't rude, but he certainly did not seem to be happy to be there. Slow to greet us initially, things continued at the same pace throughout our stay. We had to give sad puppy eyes down the bar towards him for a refill, menu's, order food, ask for the check...Etc. And no one said thank you on the way out. The food was not memorable, and my boyfriend saw one of the employees exit the restroom without washing his hands. Unacceptable. Took my husband for his birthday. &#160;I had beet salad, and scallops. &#160;The beets could have used a little something, but it was good. &#160;They served "carrot/jalapeno fritters" with the scallops and they were delicious! Tasted like Indian pakora. Husband had salmon with rice pilaf and he said it was very good. &#160;Both came with green bean/carrots that were cooked just right (little crisp). &#160;He also had Caesar salad with a giant crouton that was a bit awkward. We were seated in a side room with only 5 tables which was nice &amp; cozy, but it was dark so we couldn't enjoy the outside view but knew we were right on the water. &#160;Since we were able to take advantage of the Dine Around Seattle ($30 for 3 courses) and I had a homemade chocolate cake at home, we ended up taking our desert selections home. I later tasted my lemon tart and it was good. How wonderful was last night at Ponti's? The food was fabulous, service exceptional, and the window seat by the canal made the entire evening fabulous! This may not be the newest, trendiest restaurant in town, but it is among the very best, and last night re-affirmed it! The only thing missing here is good bike parking. Otherwise rhey would get 4'stars. &#160;This may be the best hamburger meat I have ever had. The paddy was thick though the burger small. &#160;Good selection of $3.00 beers on tap. The view is wonderful of the Fremont bridge and canal. Great service. Great happy hour. No drink purchase required. I hear they serve a strong martini. I have very mixed feelings on this place but because I LOVE their happy hour and crab spring rolls I am giving them 4 stars. I would advise people not to go here if they want to go to a nice dinner. Their food is okay but definitely not worth the price. On the other hand, they have a GREAT happy hour. The food is delicious and the drinks are great too. The waitstaff is friendly and it's a nice atmosphere. Great food and service the night we came for Restaurant Week. Came here for a pre-mother's day dinner for the different mom's in our family. It was nice inside the restaurant with how everything is setup. The only regret is that it is small inside with not much room to move around. It almost felt like a sardine can in our seating area with all the tables close around. The food wasn't bad, but I didn't think it was terrific for the price you pay. I mean for $25 I only had a seafood pasta dish that I could have made myself. Not worth it.  Also there is no view of the ship canal from where we were sitting so another downer. I'm not sure if I would come here again.
If I'm in the U District, hungry and have time to kill before seeing a movie, because that's normally the only reason I'm in the U District, this is one of my go to places. &#160;I'm not going to lie it is a bit sketchy and a bit dirty since it's a bus it yourself kind of place and not everyone is clean and tidy. &#160;When you first walk in look to your left there is the menu, pictures with descriptions of what's to eat, a bit over whelming if you ask me because there are so many options and food pictures to look at. &#160;First time I went with the small BBQ chicken plate with a side of (Mac)crackaroni salad. &#160;Chicken is always good, tender and juicy and not too sweet. &#160;The crackaroni salad is probably my favorite in Seattle, so far. &#160;It's crackalicious with just the right amount of crack sauce to make me go mmm ohh yah! &#160;My other favorite is a small order of the Hawaiian fried rice with Portuguese sausage, and of course with a side of crackaroni salad. &#160;It's good cheap food that will fill you up for days, but be warned if you use your debit card you get charged a fee by them I think it's $.50 but not sure so you might want to bring cash. This is one of U-Dubs favorites or maybe just mine. Mr Chan has &#160;mastered the art of Hawaiian BBQ. He keeps it it more Loco then L&amp;L. Tons of flavor and optimal value for what you pay. So the Meat jun and the Hawaiian BBQ chicken are must tries. The chicken has more flavor than L&amp;L's. The Spam Musabi is consistent. &#160; If &#160;you are feeling quite spendy the BBQ mix is great value. For the 7 years frequenting here I never tried the loco moco or plan to. I don't want my cholesterol to sky rocket. The downside is if your dating a high maintenance chick, this is not a place to take her. You might have to get it to go and grab some plastic ware. This Hawaiian BBQ Restaurant is right next to Pochi's. Although it's a bit far up the Ave, if you have the time, skip University Teriyaki and get over to this restaurant. The selection is endless, the portions are large, and the prices are greatt. I ordered the #56, which was a dish that has fried rice, katsu, spicy chicken, and a fried egg... all for a grand total of $7.10 including tax. The interior isn't fancy and it's quite cozy, but for a little family restaurant on the Ave, I don't think we can ask for much more. As for customer service, it's pretty straight forward.It's not that they were rude or anything like that at all, but it was simple..take the order, give the food..you sit..you eat..you bus :) simple. Overall, the food was fantastic and this is definitely one of my favorite restaurant on the ave. im from hawaii so i may be a little more picky. &#160;definitely not anywhere near as good as places im used to in hawaii. &#160;but im not in hawaii, so with that in mind i eat here. &#160;and i enjoy my meal everytime. &#160;i would give 3 and a half stars if i could. &#160;food satisfies my craving, the owner is pretty cool, it could use a good cleaning and updating on the inside, but the prices are just as they are in hawaii. &#160;LESS MAYO ON THE MAC!
Fine a for a quick lunch. Other Taco Del Mar's have had better service. The menu was less than descriptive, but fortunately I knew what I wanted. Those behind the counter were worse than other locations at understanding that the "vegan" which is on the menu does NOT come with sour cream or cheese, but DOES come with guacamole. This is part of a strip of indoor food shops, so there's some seating in the hallway which is fine if it's busy.TDM generally has fresh tasting vegetables and beats a Taco Bell or whatnot hands down. Expect a little bit of sauce leakage. Some prefer to eat the burritos with a fork due to their risky size. If it's too much for you, order an "almost". I have to disagree with Todd on this location. I have had no such experiences with the cream and sauce issue, nor have I noticed any hygiene issues. I live a few blocks away, so I eat here frequently and have had really good food here. My freind had a quesadilla the other night which was made with steak and lots of cheese, along with a good pico. It was awesome. I opted for a healthy, low cal option; a baja bowl with no cheese, sour cream or guacamole. I had them add cilantro, lettuce, some corn salsa and mojito sauce...it was great tasting and really healthy.
YUM! Have tried other Ethiopian places and this one is always a step above.
This place is great. &#160;If you need to order food for a large event on a low budget you can't find a better place. &#160;They got my order right, were especially friendly, and include plenty of sauces. &#160;The sandwiches taste great and are enough to fill you up. The best sandwiches on the ave.Very friendly, cheap food, really tasty! It's not a fine-dining restaurant, this is peasant food. And us peasants love it.BBQ pork bahn mi, that's the key to happiness right there. Love, love, love this place. &#160;The ice water has limes in it. &#160;The pho, vietnamese sandiches and stir frys are all delicious. &#160;The atmosphere is cozy and the service is warm and friendly! &#160;As a U-district resident I am a frequent patron of this place, whether I'm eating in or eating out. &#160;I'll always keep coming back. This is hands down my favorite Vietnamese restaurant on or near The Ave. The Vietnamese Banh Mi sandwiches are the best around. They are only around $3.50 a sandwich and each one is sizable. They make it right in front of you and it tastes appropriately fresh. When I don't feel like the sandwiches, I order the Royal Plate. The pork, chicken, shrimp, and egg really justifies the cheesy name. The prices are reasonable and the service is great. I don't know if Thanh Vi is very "authentic" but their food is very good regardless, authentic or not. Vegetarian options are great, and like others have said, the service is fantastic. Yeah, okay, five stars. I adore this place. It's my go-to pho spot when I want something fancier than Than Bros. Their veg pho is amazing - so flavorful, piping hot and full to the brim of veggies. I also love the wonton noodle soup, not least because the wontons look like little brains. The bahn mi is tasty as well, and a steal at something like $3.change.The employees/owners are wonderful. They always call you sister (or brother if you're, you know, a dude) and are genuinely warm and pleasant every time I have gone in there. Nothing hits the spot on a cold rainy Seattle day like a visit here, for my belly and my soul. Nothing fancy here, just good food at a reasonable price.The pork skewers that came with my vermicelli bowl were outstanding. The service was very good. I would eat here again. This is my favorite Pho shop in all of Seattle. &#160;I found it after listening to a KUOW program on where to find the best Pho. &#160;I agree with others who note the friendly service. &#160;It is a favorite for my husband to take our teenage daughter as it gives lots of time to talk, over a steaming bowl of wonderful food!!! I love you Thanh Vi!!! Went here for a late lunch today and ordered the Banh Mi meat combo and the Banh Mi mushroom. For around $7.50 this was easily enough food for 2 people unless they are really hungry [instead, though, I gorged myself and ate them both - MMM gluttony]. The meat combo was good - crispy bread, lots of carrots and parsley, and a good portion of meat - however, the meat was not hot which took away from it a bit. The mushroom was great - hot sandwich piled with mushrooms and a tasty sauce that soaked the bread. Covered both in spoons of chili sauce and plum sauce and was good to go.I will most definitely be coming back here for some cheap lunches during school. And yeah, the pictures from the website must be of their other location because this one is not an "upscale dining experience" but the waitress was very nice and the food was fantastic. We love sister!!! While I was in college, this is my go to place for viet food. I think they have the best pho in the area. The service is much better than its nearby competitors and the owner lady is always friendly. They have a friendly loud server who wears a apron with "beauty" on it. He is a friendly fellow who lightens up the place. They sometimes get busy during rush hours but always manage to give decent service. If you are in the area and in dying need of pho. This is a good place to try.Pro: Service, great staff, friendly atmosphereCon: some of the food items have increased in price I feel I must repeat the sentiment of many yelpers here in saying that the servers here are far and away the nicest, most accommodating servers I have ever experienced. Maybe in my lifetime. Every time I hear the waitress say "sister" to me, I smile inside and out. The fact that this is a family run restaurant is apparent in every way. The staff cooperates well with eachother and they treat customers like they really matter. That said, the food is also high quality. I have consistently enjoyed their bun, banh mi, pho and other delights. Great place run by some pretty fantastic people This is the place that made me like pho. I used to detest going to pho places mainly due to the pungent smell that lingers on for days after, which's not the case for Thanh Vi.I have been going to this place for about 5 years now. The aforementioned friendliness, Iris, learned my name upon my second visit and it felt very personal. The food is awesome, I've tried many items on their extensive menu: pho, veggie pho (their broth is by far the most flavorful), egg noodles, curry tofu rice dish, veggie stir fry, royal plate, sandwiches, spring rolls, egg rolls are among my favorites. The quality of food they serve surpasses my initial expectation considering the inexpensive pricing. They are also very accommodating in terms of subsitutions or adding extra things into your dish. Hands down the best Vietnamese restaurant in the greater Seattle area. I love this place. &#160;The food is great and the service is even better. &#160; The server knows my regular order and when I go for take out, they'll serve me a glass of water while I wait. &#160;I'm half Vietnamese, been to Vietnam, and eat Vietnamese food whenever I go back home. &#160;The food here is authentic and yummy. &#160;The eggrolls are AMAZING. &#160;HOT. &#160;Hot and yummy. &#160;Second only to the ones made by my family. &#160;The spring rolls are more forgettable. &#160;But it's difficult to go wrong with anything. &#160;I've ordered the sandwiches, the soups, the noodles, the rice. the &#160;banh xe and I've liked everything, especially their rice dishes. &#160;I'm just a rice-loving gal. &#160;I've heard people complain that it's a "grimy" place. &#160;But think about it. &#160;They cook in this tiny area at the front of the restaurant that is open to the dining area. &#160;The cooking vapors will go all over the place and might make somethings "sticky." &#160;It's in no way dirty and they do a really great job in keeping the restaurant in a great condition. &#160;Even after I graduate I will probably be back. &#160;=) I get cravings occasionally for something fast, delicious, and filling. &#160;Often that craving is for some warm noodle soup as well as a light but filling sandwich and to ameliorate that craving, I head to Thanh Vi.Their sandwiches are awesome, a good blend of meat and those Vietnamese carrots and veggies. &#160;In addition to the large size of their sandwiches, the price is very affordable, roughly $3 per sandwich.The pho is just as good as anywhere around the area and I can only complain that they don't have as much size options as strictly pho places nearby. &#160;However, their expansive menu allows for variety in the case of large groups or indecisive eaters.The staff is friendly and quick. &#160;The often comes with a bit of lime juice squeezed in. &#160;Overall a great affordable meal, whether you need a sandwich or pho! This place is so different from the typical pho restaurant around u-district.their pho's soup tastes so delicious!! &#160;as well as spring rolll!! it tastes so different and yummy! taste fresh and savory!!!my favorite is seafood pho. it has squid, crap meat (imitation), shrimp (sooo yummy and fresh). i would probably not go any pho place from now on but thanh vi!!!interior looks very clean and the service is pretty good :) Pho, Banh Mi, Spring Rolls etc - Get Some! &#160;So tasty and inexpensive and filling. &#160;The staff is super friendly too. My favorite pho in seattle. So go try it. The sauce is the boss. This is my favorite pho place on the Ave. &#160;Their pho broth is by far the most flavorful. &#160;It's a little pricier than some of the other Vietnamese places in the area, but worth it, in my opinion. &#160;I can't wait to try their bun, banh mi, or fresh shrimp rolls. &#160;The last time I went there, it was pretty slammed so the service wasn't fantastic. &#160;However, the water they served was especially cold, which was a nice contrast to my big bowl of pho. &#160;I know most people seem to like being called "sister" by the waitress, I'm still getting used to it. &#160;I already have two sisters, which is plenty for me! &#160;However, if you want some flavorful pho and a sibling to boot, come to Thanh Vi. &#160;It's yummy. No one is kidding when they say the hostess/cashier lady is ridiculously nice. Like I wanted to give her a hug as soon as she spoke to me. Kind of reminded me of the high end guest service you get anywhere in Asia land. Very proper and sincere and smily. She's definitely one of those people you wish the best in life.I'm broke, like usual, so I didn't get a chance to try out the main dishes but I did order a beef banh mi and a chicken ham bao and a pork banh mi for my roomie. Those sammies are STUFFED with meat. The banh mi from saigon deli seems so mini in comparison. The chicken ham bao was okay...I probably won't be getting it again. The filling was too solidified and the egg yolk was pretty dry. Maybe I was expecting too much considering I grew up with ham bao and siao pao from the Philippine islands, NY's Chinatown and our own International District.I will definitely be back to Thanh Vi for more! I firmly believe the ham bao was just an example of the worst they could do (which is not that bad at all) This is the best Vietnamese food on the Ave. in my opinion. The flavors are crisp, and you'll always get good service, especially is Iris is around. The pho isn't too salty and you get plenty of meat. The huge menu is also a plus. The only drawback is slightly higher prices (between 0.50 and 1.00 more than other places), but what you get is worth it. Oh my God. Why didn't I ever try the "Served on Tray - Khay" here? It has taken me two years to discover this wonderful dish. It's a ginormous plate full of lettuce, carrots, bean sprouts, cilantro, basil, your choice of meat and vermicelli noodles that comes with five spring roll papers and the sweet &amp; sour sauce. You roll your own spring rolls, so it's time consuming (thus forcing you to take your time eating, so that you don't eat too much too fast) and fun. AND FREAKIN DELICIOUS. I had the chicken (which was marinaded juuuust right) and my friend had the pork, spring roll &amp; prawns, which looked great as well.I highly recommend getting this plate here. It's my favorite Vietnamese dish now (it used to be Saigon Deli's rice vermicelli bowl but this one has surpassed it now). We went here on Monday. Coffee was great as always. I did try the Cm c Bit this time. The shrimp wrapped in tofu skin was good but the pork was a bit dry. I think I'll stick w/ the Royal Plate next time.We tried their chicken ham bao, and the bun was soft and sweet as it should be. The egg yolk in the middle was a lil' dry, but the chicken ball was good! I'd probably give 'em another try. I love this place. The server is so nice and friendly that you can't help but smile every time she speaks to you. I tried a couple of their main dishes, and they were huge and filling. Definitely recommended if you're on the Ave and up for some good foooood! :) The best egg rolls I've ever had! I suggest doing a bit of research of what to order before hand if you are unfamiliar with Vietnamese because their menu can be a bit overwhelming, delicious, but overwhelming. I used to go here pretty often when I went to UW, and it was always a nice option to go grab light bite without it weighing you down the rest of the day. &#160; &#160;It was a pretty large selection, and I really like their mi xao, I also like their bang mi (I always order it with an added fried egg...so yummy)The service is pretty great too, really friendly, with an amazing memory. &#160;She remembers everybody's name, I don't know how she could do that. I don't do superlatives.But this is everything you have looked for in a place to eat when visiting.The Vietnamese Sandwiches are like the 80's rap group the Fat Boys; big and beautiful. &#160;All the other dishes are big bowls/plates of food that should leave you satisfied for the night. &#160;I ordered a #1 sandwich and the #44 and was instantly ashamed that I couldn't finish both.The prices are amazing. &#160;The sandwich could easily be $5 for how dense and flavorful it is. &#160;You can't even really find a dish that comes in at more than $8 never mind that it will feed you for the night. &#160;I already have plans to come back here and I was just here.Here I am at 2:20am eating in my hotel room. &#160;You can't say I didn't finish what I started.
One of my new favorite restaurant spots in Seattle. Nestled in the Loveless Building in Capitol Hill, this is a cozy, quiet spot that gives you a sense of escape the moment you cross their threshold. Had the pleasure of dinning with them last October for restaurant week with stunning, thoughtful service and an elegant three course menu. It was a memorable meal as I had the Roasted Parsnip Soup, Parmesan Grissini, Cr&#232;me Fraiche &amp; Truffle Oil, followed by the Wild Boar Sausage, Braised Savoy Cabbage &amp; Fried Shallot, then wrapped up my meal with the Chocolate Molten Cake, Plum Compote. I can't stop thinking about the Wild Boar sausage. I dream about it, long for it and talk about it morning, noon and night. It's making my guy a tad jealous that I may love that Wild Boar sausage almost as much as I love him. I would have given 2.5 stars.The first time I went to Olivar it was excellent (think it was 2009-ish) then...I went back in 2011 and was disappointed.When I went in 2009 the place was packed! In 2011, it was empty...not sure if the owner/chef changed but the food lost its zing and flavors were muttled.I really liked this place back in 2009...sorry Olivar...hope you get your mojo back...when you do, I'll come by and try again.
I first tried this place because I had a coupon from the Entertainment book. I wish I had gone here years earlier. I'm a big fan of nachos and I've had them at a lot of different places. I've gotta say without a doubt this place serves the best damn nachos I've ever had. The chips are delish and the steak on top... oh... the steak.Unfortunately I've moved away and there are no Taco Guaymas locations around here. My only hope for sinking my teeth into the mouth watering steak super nachos again is when I visit relatives. *sigh*BTW, the nachos are huge and I always split them with everyone at the table and have a super burrito as well, which is also top notch. Not sure how this place can suck compared to others but it does. &#160;The Fremont location is much better. &#160;Same menu same salsa bar but somthing lacking... How do you mess up such an easy concept in a neighborhood begging to give you business?Server was super rude, food was mediocre at best, my Quesadilla looked like a 4 year old made it!Only reason to go here is for the view in the summer... not the best but not the worst. its a convenient stop while walking the lake. however my cravings take me to aqua verde... I'll skip the epic saga of my actual visit to Taco Guaymas, and get right to the point: I'd call Taco Guaymas a slightly above average rendition of the typical Californian-style (Alcoholic) Family Mexican restaurant. Good but not great food in a fun atmosphere with a rather extensive drink menu. They must have at least 50 different tequilas available. Being this far from the source though, many are quite expensive. (With a shot of Herradura Seleccion Suprema priced at $145, I'm curious whether anyone bothers to see if they're all even in stock.) The draft beer is reasonably priced, and buckets of Corona are even a pretty good deal. Also notable is the wide selection of meats available with which to fill your enchilada, burrito, or of course, taco.
I don't know what the hell it is about this place. I get random cravings for the garlic sauce in the middle of the night, and although it seems hole in the wall like, the food is something out of the extraordinary.Whenever I go, I order the ma po tofu, steamed pork dumplings, house special fried rice and the green onion pancakes. I usually like waiting until everything arrives and then get a piece of everything on my place and just drench it all with the garlic sauce. You have to drench everything in garlic sauce. I'm sure it's probably bad but my tongue goes numb after having all that garlic sauce after dinner. But I guess it's for my own good and I'm sure it's probably from all the sodium/msg or something, I don't know. Keep in mind that this place is very small, if you plan to come in with 4+ people, don't count on getting seated soon or at all, the place gets so busy and there's barely enough tables to seat 4 people a time. Best. Beef chow mein. Ever. So good with the dumplings! I have to be rolled back to the car every time.My mama and I always get a giant bag of dumplings to take home. You can do that, you know. It's great to come home and pan fry all of the delicious dumplings your little heart desires. It is a small, run down looking, unassuming place. The owner isn't the friendliest person ever, but I don't even care. Worth it. You gotta go. Numerous reviews compliment Fu Man Dumpling House and their homemade dumplings, so we decided to head there for lunch on a Sunday around 1:30pm. &#160;Driving into the lot, we noticed that there were only 3 stalls reserved for Fu Man Dumpling House patrons. &#160;Luckily, "I spy with my little eye" the sign that said "more parking in rear" Bam! (quick tip!) As we opened the door, we noticed just how small the space really was. &#160;Seven tables to be exact. &#160; &#160; &#160;The menu was also small and simple. &#160;Keeping their focus on authentic, Chinese style street vendor dishes, such as: dumplings, steamed buns, pancakes, soups, fried rice and noodles. &#160;Toward the rear of the restaurant, there is a small window to the kitchen which allows customers to ogle at the chefs in the back prepping their homemade dumplings and other ingredients. &#160;The feeling at Fu Man Dumpling House was definitely that of a family operation, small and affordable.  &#160; One order of boiled dumplings, onion pancake and special fried rice completed our order. &#160;WOW! The boiled dumplings were divine! Although I would have preferred the wrap a little thinner, I appreciated it's authenticity and generous filling. &#160;I was about three dumplings in before I remembered to use the garlic sauce! Holy Moly! This sauce is a winner - but use with caution! It will give you extreme garlic breath! The house special fried rice was lovely and the onion pancakes, ok. &#160;We originally wanted the leek pancakes but sadly, they were sold out for the day :(. If I have persuaded you into dining here at Fu Man Dumpling House, my tip would be that you either arrive early, phone ahead with a take out order, or be prepared to wait. &#160;I'd strongly suggest you have parties no larger than six and that additional parking is located in back. I always get kind of anxious and weirded out with chinese restaurants with strange names. If you know anything about fu manchu, you know that he's this scary evil Asian cartoon character that proliferated Asian American stereotypes.ASIDE from that, this place is delicious! I never knew that this place existed like 5 minutes from my house, but it's basically a Taiwanese establishment that serves dumplings, and other dishes. Not just any dumplings. Hand-made dumplings. You can tell because of the way they fold them; each one is individually made.We also ordered their fried rice which was pretty good and standard, but I was a little weirded out by the wonton soup we ordered. Growing up Cantonese, this isn't the typical wonton mein you normally get, the noodles are different and the dumplings are completely different. But once again, this is a Taiwanese place so I guess I should expect different types of food.Anyhow, small establishment, but it's clean! Service is also pretty nice too. We have been back a few times since the first time that we went here. &#160;Each time, we order their chow mein which seems to be a hit with our family as well as each time we bring it to a pot luck. &#160;This is one of the first meals to be devoured when sharing with others. &#160;We usually get the chicken and the pork chow mein. &#160;They vary a little in terms of how much flavor they add and how greasy. &#160;Sometimes the sauce or flavor is sooooo good that it is hard not to eat this food.Then, we decided to order dumplings to go. &#160;When we had dumplings at the restaurant they were just okay. &#160;But, for some reason it was either the batch was much better or the fact that we had them refrigerated and ate them later in the day or the garlic dipping sauce was better or all of the above, but they were just as scrumptuous as the chow meins that we order to go.I have to upgrade my review to 5 stars because of how good it really can be and how much other people that we share the food with always ask where we got the food from and how much they liked it. Boiled dumplings - 3.5: It's got really good ginger kick to it and also got decent amount of juice from the meat in the dumplings.Chow mein - 2.5: &#160;A bit too greasy. Greasiness overpowered seasonings. Vegetables in the noodles tasted pretty good. Amazing dumplings. Only issue is they run out. Call ahead as it takes about 20-25 minutes. It isn't a pop in and out place. So fresh. So good. So kind. You must have everything on the menu!!! Best Dumplings in Seattle. Period. Best pot stickers around. First time we've had them boiled... delicious. Really mean looking owner, but he really treats his customer like the member of his own family.Can't go wrong with anything in the menu. Everything is good. And may I say, ADDICTING!!!I'm there at least once a week to get my dumpling and ma-po tofu fix.There's always people waiting in line during dinner hours.
i'm almost ashamed to admit that i patronize this particular chain, given my very brief stint as a "sandwich artist" years ago, but well... i gotta give this location its propers.the staff here has never failed to move the line quickly and keep the mood light while doing so. there's one guy who's always there when i come in for lunch, and he's amazing. every time i see him he's smiling and making conversation.the sandwiches themselves are better than i remember, and the ingredients at least taste as fresh as subway claims them to be. given the price, the combo is a fine deal. plus every so often the little card they have pays off and i get free food. i like free food.(note: technically wheelchair accessible so i couldn't select "no", but i would NEVER try to navigate a wheelchair in this place.)
Not impressive. While the decor is pretty garish, the lighting was way too bright and the scene at midnight on a Saturday night was dead and terrible. The W Hotel needs to learn from their national counterparts and really fix things up. Ambiance and vibe is everything. Turn the lights down, make the mood more sexy and modern, and play some better music. Great spot. Good service, nice crowd. Not a destination but definitely a place to meet up before heading out. Expensive happy hour, short happy hour, and really really slow service.
Truly yummy. The toast with the pears and apples and almonds and cheese was probably one of the tastiest things I ever had. It took me a while just to taste all the flavors cuz it had so many layers of yum. What a combination of sweet and savory! That was definitely the highlight of the night, but the cured pig face and salmon were also quite good. The waiter told us that they killed 3 pigs the day before so they could eat their face. Wow. I went on Monday for the happy hour but it was still super pricy. I spent 30 bucks on the salad, salmon, and $5 wine and afterwards I was ready to eat a big burger. So don't come too hungry unless you're a high roller. Very very good - starting with woman who took our reservation asking very specific questions about food allergies/vegetarian needs, proceeding to easy introduction when we arrived, and on to great bottle of wine, and outstanding food. &#160;There were 4 planned courses, along with an amuse bouche to start, and a blueberry sorbet intermezzo. &#160;Husband at first worried that we would leave hungry - but the portions were just right (this isn't appleby's) and quality of food very high. &#160;The only course that missed a bit (and kept me from awarding a full 5 stars) was a pasta dish that had too many flavors. &#160;I will certainly go back - and it's an amazing value. My girlfriend and I sat at the communal table which was a bit awkward at first (we were expecting other couples but found ourselves seated with a jovial group of eight very good friends), but quickly became as soon as we all found common conversation around Chef Dustin's impressive culinary skills. &#160;Quail anchored the evening and was rounded out with scallops, prawns and a delicious cream puff served with a good (although, IMO, the flavor pairing was a bit off) pear sauce. &#160;Creative amuse bouches to boot. &#160; &#160;Four courses of bliss. &#160;Highly recommended. This place was really ridiculously amazing...you just have to try it to believe all the hype... Woah, I am confused by this place and the reviews. The food was pedestrian and we left feeling as though our meal was absolutely over priced. They are lovely folks and have good intentions, I just don't think that they quite make it all the way. We went to Art of the Table in October. The experience was incredible. The wine and food pairings were fabulous, and the quality of the food was amazing. The short ribs fell apart when you put the fork into them. The soup was divine; the homemade cayenne ice cream with fruit crisp was an inventive, delectible dessert. I can't wait to go back to AOTT. In my opinion, a dinner here is better than a dinner at the Herbfarm, Palisades, or Canlis. Not that you need to confirm what you already know, Seattle, but you have a treasure on your hands. &#160;Treat it well.Amazing food, great company, awesome concept. &#160;The best Valentine's Day I've ever had with Dustin's "Sexy" Menu. &#160;The roasted garlic soup with sea scallops was INCREDIBLE as was the chocolate strawberry tart. Am I missing something?I went for the "Happy Monday," and started by ordering fish (trout). &#160;There was nothing to complain about the trout, but it also wasn't any better than what you can get at other decent seafood restaurants such as McCormick &amp; Schmick's.Then I moved onto the ravioli, and found the mushrooms to be too salty for my taste, and the ravioli not as tasty as the ones I had at 5 Spot.The dessert, on the other hand, was good. &#160;It balanced the taste of Meyer lemon ice cream, hazelnut brown butter cake, blueberry compote and orange sauce very well. &#160;It was not too sweet and had the right amount of each element.So am I missing something here? &#160;Are my taste buds not refined enough to pick up the subtle flavors that make the first two dishes great? &#160;Maybe, but likely not. &#160;I do seem some pictures of food from Art of the Table that look much better than the ones I've had tonight, so I will probably give this place another shot. The most delicious, fulfilling, memorable dining experience I have ever had in Seattle. Period. And I have had many. I am salivating in my mouth as I am writing this review.You gotta give it up to the man who opens a restaurant with weird hours, and still manages to maintain a consistent five star rating on Yelp and having Seattleites madly professing their love for this place. &#160;Dustin, you've done well.He puts so much thought, creativity, and love into his food. &#160; Someone greets you at the door, guiding you into a restaurant that looks like a big dining room. &#160;You can peer into the kitchen, and everyone will wave and say Hi like you are an extended family member who popped in for a meal. &#160;Food is extraordinary. &#160;Definitely worth the dough.And if you're still waiting for the economic stimuls plan to kick in, check out their happy hour on Mondays (all night) for a cheap taste. One of the best restaurant experiences I've had in Seattle - Art of the Table is a unique, leisurely and awesomely delicious experience. &#160;We at there this past Saturday, and were very impressed by the caliber of each course, as well as the tasty recommended wine selections. &#160;The Wagyu steak for the third course was bar none one of the best steaks I've ever had.I'd also like to respond to some of the criticism regarding prices at the restaurant. &#160;We found the prices exceedingly reasonable - most comparable prix fixe menus would be a good $20-$30 elsewhere (and higher in larger cities), and we thought the wine prices were extremely affordable as well. &#160;It's true that by the end of the meal, you're likely shelling out $90 per person plus tip, but that's a very reasonable price to pay for a dining experience that easily ranks in the top 10 restaurants in Seattle (and would compare favorably with the top tier restaurants in larger cities like Chicago, NYC and SF). &#160;We'll definitely be going back and bringing friends. &#160;Highly recommended. Stop the time, clear your evening schedule and savor every bite while at "The Art of the Table". This is a personal favorite of all cities. This is the BEST in Seattle. And if the reviews have not convinced you, stop by this place on a Happy Monday, to sample all the magic the chef has created. I had a fun time at Art of the Table. &#160;You get the privilege of an intimate space and a chef that comes out after every round of food to explain. &#160;That's unique to Art of the Table in the immediate vicinity.However, besides the collective appreciation for food that I shared with the other diners that night, I think our views differ a bit.The food was good, don't get me wrong! &#160;But for the price I paid, I was expecting something more. &#160;I actually think I had over-hyped it in my own mind to expect something... exotic. &#160;My mahi and pork belly were not exotic. &#160;Perhaps this is something I should take up with myself and my therapist! If you have the money to spare, go. &#160;I think your experience can hinge around the food you are served. &#160;Maybe skip the wine flight and save yourself a few dollars. Yum, yum, YUM!We are part of a dinner group that goes here every few months. &#160;It is such a treat and what a restaurant should be. &#160;Each course is served with time to really enjoy it and to visit with each other. &#160;I didn't feel rushed to wolf down my food before more came out.I love that Dustin shops for the groceries locally and at the Market. &#160;He seems kind of shy about his great dishes although he should know that he cooks AMAZING food.A great place for friends and family. Yummy! Went here on a Monday for their happy-hour type deal. Two friends and I dialed down the line and ordered one of everything (6 dishes) and three desserts. Two teas. 72 bucks total. Everything was great. Particularly delicious was the frisee, bacon, feta, arugula salad with egg and a sherry vinaigrette, a wild-mushroom-and-black-truffle-stuffed crepe, and toast with a melted Tome cheese, cubed apples, and something I forget. All super tasty with both distinct and perfectly melded flavors. The desert of pistachio-filled profiteroles with chocolate ganach and cacoa nibs on top on a pool of warm cinnamon-and-pear sauce was fantastic. My friend said it was the best desert she'd ever had. All in all, very tasty, very fresh, very distinct, and at a really nice value in a cute, no-fuss place.I'm a very big fan. Sublime. &#160;I had heard of this place on Yelp, and was intrigued enough to drag a friend along to the communal table for a three-hour experiment. &#160;I definitely wish that I had heard of this place earlier, because it's so friendly, so genuine, and obviously Dustin has so much love for what he does that the food is just incredible. &#160;Everything about the meal was perfect, from the perfectly cooked and seasoned risotto to the wonderfully earthy mushrooms to the perfectly appropriate profiterole and I hope they stay in business for many years to come.The wine pairings were tasteful and very well thought-out, and before each course Dustin would come out, strike his gong, and share a little bit about the dish and his process in making it. &#160;This personal touch really added to the experience, and it almost felt like a great meal at home with friends instead of just some restaurant. &#160;The seating was intimate, and the client&#232;le that were in attendance when I went were delightful company and provided great conversation and an equal love for great food and wine.As soon as they reopen, I'll be planning another visit, hopefully with a larger party! I ate here with my wine-tasting group early last fall. &#160;It's been long enough ago that I don't remember everything on the menu, but I do remember that smoked tomato cheesecake, which was to die for! &#160;Very relaxed, comfortable vibe. &#160;You're welcome to come in to the kitchen and chat with the chef and see your food being prepared, and there's a garden out back you can hang out in. &#160;Each course is introduced by the chef, and he announces it with a little gong.That night was certainly the best $55 full-course dinner I've ever eaten. &#160;I also went for the wine flight, a small glass of wine for each course, chosen to match the food. &#160;There was one last-minute substitution that I was less than thrilled with, but altogether, the wine pairings were great.All I can say is, don't walk, RUN! to Art of the Table. Good luck getting in, but it's worth it! Small enough that every meal is like a private party, with wonderful service and imaginative food. Go with a group! High is an understatement of my expectations going into the meal at Art of the Table. &#160;I had heard of the restaurant from numerous friends and read the reviews on Yelp. &#160;I'm also cursed by the case of having a sister who is a wonderful and creative chef. &#160;After living in San Francisco for 4 years I thought I had tasted the best in the organic and seasonal recipes.The 3 hours I spent with Dustin, Laura, the Soux-chef and my friend was a true culinary delight. &#160;From the moment we walked in the door the relaxing environment and smell of simmering food combined to put us in the perfect mood. &#160;Better yet, no one seemed concerned that we brought a few bottles of wine ($20 corkage).The crab cakes on a mixture of greens was a great way to start off the night. &#160;We then moved into an incredible garlic soup with hints of truffles and an island piece of bread topped with chantrel mushrooms. &#160;In between courses we were treated to a sorbet of parsnips and vanilla. &#160;The main course was duck leg paired with sauteed greens (but still crunchy:)) sitting on top of &#160;a wheatberries combined with other vegetables and sitting next to a plum sauce.I've reserved the last paragraph for the desert because it was that good. &#160;The plate consisted of an orange cake (in the style of key lime pie) and ginger ice cream. &#160;The combined tast of the elements was an explosion of taste goodness. &#160;The hint of the ginger ice cream remained with our tast buds for &#160;30 minutes after leaving the restaurant - delicious.The best meal I've eated in the past 18 months. Well I've come here 5 times for the Happy Monday tapas style meals and I have to say I've had some of the best food I've ever eaten, at least in Seattle. &#160;The chef's ability to put dishes together amazes me, and the dishes are almost always much more than the sum of their parts. The price also isn't unreasonable if you bring a friend or two and want to sample the entire menu. &#160;We usually got 5 or 6 dishes out of 8 and we're talking 50-60 bucks. &#160;It's not a huge amount of food, but it's been enough to leave us satisfied.As for consistency, it does vary a bit, particularly since the menu changes every week. &#160;Don't get me wrong, I've never had a bad dish here or one that I hadn't finished. &#160;Some of the dishes are "Mmmm that was pretty good" and some are "Oh my god, how is this possible?" &#160;I've had at least one of the latter each time I've been. Dinner was unforgettable! We ate at Art of the Table (10/2/2008) - the communal-dining/dinner-party restaurant. Five courses of unusual variants of northern Italian cuisine, paired with rare organic wines from small Italian vineyards. I was a good sport and ate most of what was served; I ate all of Francis Ford Coppola's mother's recipe of linguine with white anchovies, but only a couple of bites of the rabbit's leg. (The rabbit had great texture, but I had a mental block when it came to swallowing the masticated remains.) Art of the Table is the kind of restaurant that gives Foodies a hard-on. The food at Art of the Table was very tasty and left me wanting more....because the portions were rather small. $60 total for my guest and I and we were still rather hungry when we left. This ain't Claim Jumpers, that is for sure. Nor is it the Cheesecake Factory: the menu is very brief. Good thing what they do offer is very good.The place is very small but that didn't bother me, but I did feel bad for the folks who had to wait for a table. All in all, I liked my evening at Art of the Table.
I've only ever had take-out here. Not that it doesn't look cute and pleasant here -- but I usually remember I am hungry AFTER leaving the market and Kastoori Grill is a good quick pit-stop on the way back home. And holy cow. Yum yum yum. I know i've had a vindaloo here, maybe a lamb saag dish -- but all I really care about is their paneer. It is freaking amazing! Muttar Paneer, Paneer Tikka Masala, whatever. That home-made cheese is always so sooooooooo good. Their naan may seem a bit pricey -- but even after a walk or bus trek home the naan is fluffy, warm and absolutely delicious. Spice levels are awesome because they are not afraid to bump that heat up when you ask for 5 stars -- it has a good kick that slowly builds so by the time you finish your meal your lips are all tingly and your sinuses adequately cleared. Orders are large too, so feel free to split a single entree -- you will still get full!It doesn't take long to get your order, they will offer water while you wait, and double check your order before handing it off to you. A nice place for something a little different if you are in the market! All of the other reviews are correct -- best Indian subcontinent food I've ever had.My wife and I could not believe our luck, in that this fantastic restaurant is just a few feet from Pike Place Market. &#160;On our daily walk to the Market, the delicious aromas from this restaurant waft and attract visitors from a 2-block radius. &#160;The naan is delicious, fresh, and brought to your table. &#160;The lamb, eggplant, lentils, and chicken tikka masala from the buffet ($10 per person at lunch) were perfect. &#160;The crowning jewel was the most tender, flavorful tandoori chicken that we'd ever had. &#160;Dessert was cool, perfectly-balanced rice pudding.Seattle is a fantastic city for foodies, and this place has to be on your list if you love Indian food. &#160;My wife and I are from Maryland, and we will definitely be coming back to the city for the Chihuly exhibit, delicious seafood, and Kastoori Grill!! A friend and I were looking for a place to have some good Indian food and we found this place on Yelp so we decided to go check it out.We got here early so they were having some appetizer specials. &#160;We asked our waitress (who turned out to be the owner!) to suggest some appetizers, she was very helpful and not only suggested things we ought to try, she was honest enough to suggest one item that she wouldn't recommend (I believe she has since removed this item from the menu due to poor reviews). &#160;I found her honesty very refreshing and her recommendations very helpful. &#160;Of the items she suggested we were already planning on trying all of them except the mussels.Thank goodness we listened to her suggestion!!! The curried mussels were exceptional, particularly with an order of garlic naan to soak up the extra sauce. &#160;This was by far the highlight of the meal, in fact we ordered a second round because we couldn't get enough.I will definitely visit again when I'm in town. &#160;The only thing I was mildly disappointed with was that they don't have a Gundruk soup (it's a traditional spicy Nepalese soup made from cured mustard leaves). &#160;The owner assured me that she plans to add that to the menu in the near future. &#160;If it lives up to my expectations, I may have to bump this up to a 5-star rating! The smell of the place when you walk in is intoxicating. They serve traditional Indian, not BIR. Plenty of black and green cardamoms. I got the Chicken Vindaloo and was asked for my heat preference on a 1-5 scale. I told my waiter 5 as I have a high tolerance for capsaicin. He confirmed with a warning. It was proper hot curry and the best food I've had in Seattle so far. I'll be going back before I leave. My first experience with Indian food and what a great place to do it at. I am in love with the Shrimp Tikki Masala. It was a bit on the salty side (to be expected with any soupy type dish). Service is fast (don't expect friendly convo with the wait staff though).
So I'm not going to throw around the, oh, so overly played-out terms people love to throw around, like:Douche-baggery.Douche Central.Frat Central.Hoochie bar.Douche-ville.Skanks-ville.Toolbags.Glam-jocks. Douche fratties. meh...All those apply if your snobby ass really tries to pick the crowd apart, but you know what you're getting into from scanning the outside crowd.This is not typically, wait, not at all my crowd, but I was dragged out tonight by co-workers who wanted to "dance." &#160;I don't dance, and if I do, I dance like a white boy, unless I'm drinking, then I just dance like an ass.There's a lot of twenty-something ladies and gents. Most of the girls are dressed pretty skankie, but some pull it off tastefully. Eye-candy never hurt anyone.I don't know why this place is called the Ballroom when there's clearly no ballroom or ballroom dancers. Is it the bros accidently brushing their balls with another going from room to room or the cue balls on the table? What a clever name...not so much.There's a cage on the dance floor. Pretty classy. I don't mind it. Maybe it should be called the "Cageroom." I'm not that clever.I don't think it would be fair to rate this place solely on this night. The music was decent; DJ played a lot of old school (90's--is this considered old school now?) and new hip-hop. There's two bars to even out the crowds. Most forget about the second bar in the back and jam up the one at the entrance. There's plenty of seating, but if you want to use it you better get here early (8pm). The waitstaff and bartenders are pretty quick; good service overall.Seven dollar cover charge is a scam, but the drinks are right about where they should be. Five bucks for a mix drink or a double for 8. Beer on tap is 4 bucks. I'd say you drink up at the bar next door and then come here if you really have to.If I ever do come back it would be early in the night, maybe on a weekday, I'd sit outside, and enjoy a slice of pizza. Maybe grab a pitcher of beer and play some pool before the clubbing crowd starts showing up.IF I did have to throw a term around it would be "Shameless Dick-heads." This is for the 4 dudes that ganged up on a couple and knocked the chick out cold on the concrete. Pretty tough of you bitches to run off. In my opinion, if you haven't been to the Ballroom on a weeknight, you really haven't experienced all that it has to offer. It is much more than a packed house on Friday and Saturday nights and let me tell you why:*Great HH specials and some speedy service*A cozy, laid back space with indoor AND outdoor fire pits*The music plays at 'just the right volume' allowing you to talk with your friends without yelling.. a novel concept for a bar, I know*Their slices of pizza pie really are as big as my head, and maybe bigger (yes, they're that big!) and are quite tasty*Plenty of pool, plenty of flat screens, and plenty of room to eat, drink, and be merry with friendsThis is definitely a place we'll be frequenting again and again for HH. It's perfectly casual, yet slightly classy, and it's great for big groups... it's also the the kind of bar where both the ladies and the gents will feel at ease. Good stuff. If you can't judge a place by an Elite event, go to a weekday happy hour.Let's be realistic and honest here. If you judge a place solely on broad stereotypes of it's WEEKEND clientele, you won't go out much. The Ballroom had a good number of people already chilling out, playing pool, enjoying a drink when I arrived just after 5 for the HH.The music was playing but at a reasonable bar volume. Conversation was actually possible. The Ballroom has all the same things they did when we had the Elite event there and what made it such a great event. Lot's of space and different seating options (and SO few bars have BIG booths for groups like they do here), plenty of pool tables (not just one or two), places to dance and the added bonus of indoor AND outdoor fireplaces.The garlic bread app was basic, but tasty. The pizza slice really is huge. It's WAY bigger than Katie's head. I snagged a nibble of sausage off Aaron's slice and it was good.A lot of reviews really slam on the bartenders and staff, and I just don't get it. At both the Elite event and the HH the staff was just great. Friendly, able to make suggestions on beer to me. Service slowed a little as our group grow during the time I was there, but that's to be expected as a place gets busier before the next staff is on the clock.I wish I could have stayed a bit longer for the HH, I missed some folks and only barely got to smell some others hello, but other plans in WS called. I can see going to Happy Hour here again. My friend's friends were here and wanted us to join them last night. I can't complain about the crowd and stupid $7 cover because it was Saturday night, and I knew what I was in for. So I'll set my snarkiness aside.I went to the bar to order two whiskey and lemonades. The bartender lady was really friendly, and made me even happier when she told me they made their own lemonade! I love a woman who muddles for me. It came to $10 for two. I was happy.Until I sat at my friends' table, which was being waited on by a jaded alternative chick who looked like she wanted to be anywhere else but there (I don't blame her at all!). She told me she'd rather me order from her than at the bar, so I re-ordered two whiskey lemonades.She came back and told me they were $7 each. I told her that I was charged $5 at the bar, and pointed to the lady who had served them to me. Our server stammered for a minute, tried to argue, then relented with a roll of her eyes. I think she was embarrassed and nervous about it and accidentally spilled a bunch of drinks all over the table. I felt bad for her, regardless of the almost rip-off. &#160;There was no reason to stay, so I just left after my drink. The place is too clubby for me (if you like to dance, this may be good fore you), and i don't like going out if you make me feel unwanted.GREAT lemonade and whiskey, though! Cheers to them for that! My advice? Order from the bar.*joy Yuck, yuck, yuck, blek, blek, blek, blek, ugh, blah, ugh, blah, blah, blah blah, yuck, YUCK! I understand that The Ballroom is a venue for booty shaking and booty grabbing, which can be Yuck, yuck, yuck, blek, blek, blek, blek, ugh, blah, ugh, blah, blah, blah blah, yuck, YUCK within itself. However, the staff at The Ballroom is on such a power trip that they do a hell of a job making this place the pit of nastiness. The servers, bartenders, and bouncers assume that everyone is drunk and dumb. Guess what? I was not drunk the other night nor have I ever been dumb. But the staff operate as if they are running a VIP club in LA that has a capacity of 750 people (cap at The Ballroom is 361), has four levels (they have one level), with 6 bars (they have one bar). This place has the potential to be a great night spot with its large leather booths, glowing light fixtures, and outside lounge with fireplace and heaters. However, the staff is really intense probably b/c the management has them all with their undies in a bundle. I feel bad for them b/c they seem to be great people. good side: -close to other bars-has multiple space areas: 2 bars, pool area, outside patio, dance floor with cage-coat check ($2 or $3 for 2 coats on one hanger)bad side:-cover on saturdayi'd recommend this place for a group night out as i went with a group of girls. we were a group of california girls who were in clubbing attire which i guess is a little different from seattle clubbing attire. so ladies stick to more of the casual, low-cleavage tank top with jeans look.well i was warned by the other yelp reviews there was frat boys and scandlously dressed girls but then when i went it just reminded me of every big bar/dance place u'd go in college. i was glad to see a big space and it was pretty crowded. what was with the guys dancing freaky in the cage? i think girls should only be allowed in the cage. The music selection is crap. They replay the same song 2 or 3 times a night. The crowd is rather interesting to watch though. Some come in formal clothing such as suits, some with leis around their necks, chaps, and random skank-wear. We bumped into a bachelor party who had a list of tasks for the groom to accomplish, the most fun we had all night. Despite how big it is, It gets real crowded Saturday nights. The bartender either gave himself an extra $5 tip, or he misheard me. Either way, it cost me another drink. Ah. &#160;I get it now.This is where Tyler Durden and friends get together when they don't want to commute all the way to Bellevue for the douchebag convention.When I come here, I break from my going out conventions. &#160;I take off whatever I was wearing previously and dress down. &#160;I don't shave. &#160;I put on a hoodie and I slum it with the personality handicapped.When I make smalltalk at The Ballroom, people seem almost surprised that I don't mention jamming things in their various orifices. (...or at least not right away) A few months ago, after my first visit to The Ballroom, I vowed to never come back. Reasons why: 1. On a weekend night, the joint was overrun with clientele that I found mostly obnoxious. Think frat party. 2. Cover charges are typically not my friend. 3. The bathroom is all sorts of NASTY. I realize that it's a bar bathroom, but c'mon! 4. I saw a female get punched in the face by a male (and immediately hit the ground) right outside the Ballroom's entrance. This altercation stood out to me, but it surely wasn't the only act of violence right outside the doors as the bar neared closing. So, The Ballroom left a bad taste in my mouth. However, I decided to give it another go last night for the Yelp event. Honestly, I wasn't even sure that a rockin, private party that promised free pizza, ice cream and alcohol was worth giving the place another chance, but I talked myself into it. A few good things I saw last night: 1. This place has a little something for everyone. Dancing, pool, fire pits, wii and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. So for a private event, this place is a win. 2. Quick bartenders without the holier-than-thou attitude that is all too common in Seattle's bars.With that said, I doubt I'll find myself here unless I'm at once again, an awesomely organized private function surrounded by people who save the drama for their mama. Think of the Ballroom as a friend that you meet for drinks who, unbeknownst to you, just took a strong hallucinogen. &#160;Everything is fine at first...its 6 pm on Friday; you're shooting pool, having a few drinks, and nothing seems out of the ordinary for a relatively large bar in Fremont with pool tables. &#160;Then at 8:00 p.m., (forgive this metaphor) you're friend's drugs kick in. &#160;A cover charge is instituted. &#160;Crazy music starts playing...odd looking people start arriving and begin dancing and chugging liquor. &#160;Suddenly you feel out of place. &#160;20-something year olds who look like high school students start pouring into the place and you cower in disbelief. &#160;Hair gel everywhere. &#160;People who I'll never understand start some odd mating rituals. &#160;To borrow from Hunter Thompson, the vibrations start getting nasty. &#160;Anyway...I avoid this place at all costs on a Friday or Saturday night, which appears to the two nights when a bunch of people seem to get lost enroute to Belltown and descend upon the Ballroom. &#160;It seems like a normal place before the metaphorical "drugs begin to take hold." &#160;If you like rather plastic looking people who like to get sweaty and dance, this is your place. &#160;Just not really my type of place. If you read my other reviews, I usually only muster up the energy to write if an establishment really impresses me, or supremely annoys me. Yet The Ballroom was a pleasant enough experience, thought I'd write. Last Weds wanted to take out-of-town company to play pool, and THOUGHT we were headed to Ballard Loft but suddenly hubby was heading down Leary to Fremont. Whaaa? Walked in to Ballroom &amp; man was it DARK. The pendant lighting is red, very tough to read the food / happy hour menu, &amp; the sole bartender neglected us for the first few thirsty minutes. But managed to order a few PBR's, &amp; get a pool table. nice tables, the place is clean. Felt very silly when the waitress explained the pizzas are 28 inches - yes folks, get a visual, that's a huge pizza. One slice per player satisfied nicely, very tasty w/ plenty of toppings on a thin crust. Even though on that Weds there was only 1 bartender, 1 waitress &amp; 1/2 a backup waitress, they were friendly &amp; did their jobs well. If our out-of-town guest was a serious drinker, would have gladly stayed &amp; enjoyed another beer around the outdoor fireplace. &#160;We'll be back! Not a place I typically frequent, but a nice alternative to Smelltown when my friends come in from out of town. Even though it's November, we were able to hang out on the patio next to the fire and be completely comfortable. Until, of course, some Husky fans came in and assaulted our eyes with their purple devil-clothes. The Coug in me almost pushed them in the fire but, as I didn't want to get kicked out, I refrained from violence. The rest of the clientele is pretty much your standard college-age bachelor-party type, and you can always find some people to rub elbows with. There's the option of sitting at comfy booths, playing pool on one of 8 (or is it 6?) tables, or shakin your bacon in the dance area (complete with cage, naturally). A great place if, like me, you don't want to sit still at one table all night, and don't want to bar-hop either. I came home without my lip-plumping lip-gloss (frowny face) but with my tummy full of street meat from dante's inferno across the street (smiley face). I'll count that as a wash; good times were had by all. What is with all these negative reviews? Wednesday night's wonderful trivia night is far superior to any other bar trivia I've gone to. And then, there's the pizza(s)! Thin crust, saucy and absolutely huge - they alone are reason to come. The drinks (especially the markee) are excellent; indeed, perhaps the one drawback are the prices. I try to avoid The Ballroom. To be truthful I've only had experiences here that I don't remember any of, until this past weekend, and let me start by saying I much prefer the nights when I don't remember being here.I'm sure on a weekday evening this might be an enjoyable, quiet places for a few friends, shooting pool and whatnot. On the weekends it turns into a veritable meat market, complete with coke whores in the bathroom. I'm not kidding, on Saturday a line of probably 10 women had to wait at least 10 minutes for two skanks sitting on the floor in one of the stalls to finish snorting their lines. Everytime they walked past us after that I'd wipe my nose and ask how the coke was tonight. Don't screw with my ability to pee in a timely manner you junkies. There is a lot to offer, decent drinks, pool, a dance floor, and relatively comfortable booths, a nice outdoor patio with firepits for warmth and ambiance, but definitely not a place I'd wait outside in the cold for, or pay an $8 cover under normal circumstances. I'll be sure to be drunk next time I go, it's better that I don't remember going.Warning: Lots of underdressed women, of all shapes &amp; sizes, if you know what I mean. I'm writing to come to the defense of the Ballroom's low scores. However, it is conditional; Condition 1: you go BEFORE the "club" music starts and the steep cover charge is enforced. Condition 2: you like Fremont-esque bartenders and doormen (delightfully friendly). Condition 3: you like Frisbee-sized slices of pizza. I actually don't, but the "big guy" I haunt this place with LOVES it so.. Condition 4: you like to play pool and HATE it when a stranger tries to sidle into your next game. There are plenty of tables to go around. I love this place but definitely have my times when I will go and times when I will avoid. I went there early on a Saturday evening with an old friend. A whiskey drink. Spacious. Relaxing. Games of 9-ball.Suddenly it changed. Within 30 minutes, they started playing lame 70s and 80s remixes and crappy hip-hop. The meat market procession began. &#160;Go there on the off-hours and have fun otherwise, pick somehwere else. So, I was here for the Yelp event, but that was a totally different experience then I'd guess most people will ever have, so you can see my review for that: &#160;http://www.yelp.com/biz/&#8230;A few of us went here on a Thursday night to give HH during the week a go. &#160;There was a UW basketball game on all the big TVs and the atmosphere was much better than I expected. &#160;Most booths had groups of people in them, but it wasn't crowded at all. &#160;The perfect amount of people for a laid back night out.There was music starting near the time we were leaving and it seemed to be pretty good. &#160;The pizza slices here are *huge.* &#160;Somebody at the table ordered the meatballs and they looked and smelled delicious. &#160;The calamari was ok, but I'm not the best judge of that since I'm not a giant fan. Best of all, the space was big enough for our group to move around a bit and chat without having to cram into one area. &#160;I can imagine on a weekend night the crowd would be a bit different (based on some of the people there watching the basketball game), but it seemed good on a weeknight! I love the layout here! &#160;LOVE it. &#160;When it's early in the evening, this is a great place to sit and have a drink...maybe two...then giddy up and jig your way to the dance floor!!Unfortunately, past 7pm-ish it gets lame with the start of a crowd that will only worsen with time. The music &#160;(undoubtedly), will replay itself time and time again until you feel brain washed. &#160;Blarg.Unless there is a mecca of dancing opportunities in Fremont and someones been holding out on the 411, this is the only place I feel like going to get my groove on in this hood when the "robot urge" occurs. &#160;However, the seemingly dense (in more ways than one) crowd, paired with the more so now than ever watered down drinks AND looping music makes me stray away from making it here more than a few times a year. &#160;Come to think of it, 2008 hasn't yet seen me here and to be honest I have no regrets about that. &#160;None. Pros: HUGE pizza. Like, pizza that makes you feel small. Pizza that satisfies generously with a single slice (from a 28-inch pie). OK beer selection, nice service.Cons: We were here for trivia night and the crowd became loud, huge, overdressed and a little on the ogle-y side. If I lived here, this probably wouldn't become my regular bar, but the pizza has its unique appeal and the fire pit outside is a nice way to warm up and get away from the crowd. I'm not sure if it was my extreme drunkenness or the actual quality, but the slice of pizza I scarfed down at 12:30am was mighty delicious. &#160;The greyhound was gross, but my standards were high due to the freshly-squeezed deliciousness of Tost.Another bout of Tuesday night binge-drinking might inspire me to go back. &#160;Otherwise, meh. I have had several good experiences here and 1 bad one. &#160;Usually I drink beer here and have a few shots when playing pool with buddies. &#160;It can get pretty packed on friday and saturday nights and it can take a while to get a drink. &#160;I dont like the fact that they charge a cover here, i mean its not a club, its a pool hall damnit.As for the bad experience, I went here last april for a buddies 27th birthday. &#160;There was a group of 15 or so of us celebrating my buddy ross' birrthday. &#160;His dad had given him cash to pay for all of our drinks for the evening (thankyou Charles H.) &#160;However after ordering 2 rounds of shots our waitress comes over and tells ross that she is taking his beer away and refused to serve him any more.When asked if she was serious she gets a really nasty attitude and tells him he can leave now if thats how he is going to act. &#160;So ross pulls out a roll of $100 bills and tells her to close out the tab. &#160;She brings it back and ross pays the exact amount. &#160;Our group gets up and leaves and as we are outstide on the sidewalk going to another bar the waitress comes running out to tell ross that he is an asshole for not tipping her.Well I have a tip for the waitress: &#160;"if you want my money, dont treat me like S#*T!!! I love dancing at the Ballroom with my beautiful girl Donna O on a Saturday night here. &#160;I just don't like all the drunk frat dudes staring at her. &#160; Oh well, I guess I have to expect that while dating a true hotty. &#160;The bar can be a pain at times to grab a drink, but I just have Donna get their attention. &#160;As for the food, i've never tried, but their pizza slices are huge! &#160;How good it is to be young! I should have known better. &#160;I'm more disappointed in myself for not resisting my friends' urge to descend upon this Fremont extension of the UW Greek System. &#160;Save the $7 dollar cover and buy yourself a 40 oz. of PBR next door at Norms.To sum up the crowd, I offer this vignette. &#160;As my two friends and I were out smoking a cigarette (I don't smoke, but I was out there catching some fresh air. &#160;Dig the irony?). &#160;We were approached by some chick who wanted to bum a cigarette from my friend. &#160;He obliged and they casually started talking about their tattoos. &#160;I was then approached by another girl who asked me if my two friends were in a gang. &#160;That's where the fun began.Mind you, my friends and I all work with kids. &#160;I teach 5th/6th grade, my buddy teaches middle school, and my other friends is a case manager for a youth service non-profit. &#160;This girls was your typical Fremonter (tits busting out of her dress, frazzled long curly hair from being on the way too crowded dance floor, and glazed over look of too many Malibu and pineapple drinks).She asked me again if my friends were in a gang. &#160;I asked her why she was asking me this and she replied that she wanted me to ask them for a cigarette for HER! &#160;I just started to howl with laughter and then called out to my friends. &#160;"Hey, this chick here asked me if you two are in a gang!" &#160;"She wants to bum a cigarette, but she's afraid you might knife her!" &#160;We all start laughing really loud and I quietly tell this mortified girl "You better go now and take your racial stereotypes with you. &#160;You're white and obviously shop at Anthropologie and J Crew so you have money. &#160;Buy your own damn cigarettes!"With that, brown people beware. &#160;As you descend upon the Fremont night scene, be prepared to answer to, well for lake of a better term, dumb people. &#160;Oh yeah, and make sure you stop by Dad Watsons and get a beer from the Filipino bartender!! &#160;Yes, my friends and I are Filipino. I met up with about eight other people at The Ballroom on Thursday night for some beers and banter. I had my dog with me so we sat out on the patio area. There were a few other dogs and everyone was very friendly and well behaved. And Larry the giant Mastiff put on quite a charm show. Enough space to be comfortable and share some pitchers and quiet enough to enjoy conversation. I ordered a slice of pizza.. the Draw Bridge.. and it was enormous! And delicious! Great pizza, great beer, comfortable place for friends to share a good time. I'll go back. Too bad the patio action won't be so comfortable with the turning of the season. You'll probably find me next door at Norm's inside with my pooch. Came here the other night for the Yelp event, and left with mixed feelings. The event was great, with lots of people and activities. The food and drinks were good, and had a good price tag (free.) In my mind I catalogued this place as four stars, but began to wonder...what would this place be like on a normal day? For happy hour, or Saturday night? The large and cavernous abode would most likely be less filled. You'd be able to get a pool table easy (which is probably why, more than anything, &#160;this tentatively gets a fourth star), and if you wanted a private corner there's plenty to slink off to. But otherwise, this place might be rather empty, and thus rather desolate. How does one judge a place, when it seems like it would be completely different were it not for the special occasion? And in this economy, I fear I'm more likely to inhabit cozy shacked-up small taverns rather than the sprawling raver's dance floor. I think my skeptical customer's conclusion is four stars...but with option to change on a second attempt with different, more probable circumstances. But hey, I guess that counts as an urge to be a repeat customer, right? A basic not-so-grungy pub in Fremont. Nothing special but a good place to get a beer. Never had the food. Pizza is massive. &#160;I can eat a lot. &#160;2 slices are you're solid. &#160;Excellent beer selection (but seriously, that comes with being in Seattle.) &#160;Pool tables are really well maintained. &#160;Warning: Weds are Trivia night, so if you're wanting to have intimate conversations, it's a little difficult cause the entire place has speakers. This is Fremonts best meat market. Specializing in tantalizing young fawns &amp; not quite so appealing douche bags.Pop-a-colla? This place fills up on the weekends, so there tends to be a line after 10:30. Its getting better, you don't get wanded &amp; serched as much these days. It is Fremont after all. I like the week nights, more laid back, better service. Lots of pool tables. wii &amp; trivia nights are fun. I love hanging out by one of their two gas fire pits. I couldn't get in here at 1:30am on a Saturday night because they had already announced last call. What the hell does that have to do with anything? Please allow me to spend money grabbing a last slice of pizza and a coke in your establishment, I'm driving anyway. Whatever, I like the 5 Point better for late night grubbing. (Norm's was closed up half an hour early too. WTF is the deal with Fremont? Buncha pansies or something).We came back on a Weds night to meet up with a vendor/client (yeah he's now both) and spoil him rotten by buying him drinks, rounds of pool, and later breakfast at Beth's. He recommended the Ballroom for the Weds night Trivia. (Check it out here: http://www.quiznight.net&#8230;). The trivia WAS awesome, the questions were not out of a trivia pursuit box, but written by the MC (I think), and there were several rounds with really different types of categories, etc. Good times!The bartender was awesome. I discovered I can tell the difference between Manny's and Mac and Jack's purely via taste test. He took the time to confirm my results. He also threw in free pool, though I think that's because some other yahoo told him to put our game on his card. Probably by accident.Speaking of pool... there's a bunch of pool/billiards tables here (like six). No darts. Dammit man, give me a game I can win. I got my ass handed to me by my biz partners until I finally achieved that optimal level of buzz from drinking beer and jager shots where the physics of hitting a ball with a stick and knocking other balls into holes at weird angles becomes natural and easy. That's at about the same point that I start cracking really obnoxious jokes that terrify and embarrass my friends and reduces me to a drooling giggling idiot. I mean more-so than usual.They won three, me and our vendor/client won two. We decided to quit while we were ahead/behind.We hung out outside, where I made friends with some girl's dog (a brindle boxer mixed with a blue heeler. Very similar to my brindle terrier mixed with a heeler) and traded really raunchy, offensive jokes with some guy from Alaska. One of the servers came out and hung out for a bit, and we discussed being half Italian and somehow naturally being able to affect a Jersey accent when we both had grown up on the west coast.So... I knock off several stars for the lame weekend hours, and add them back on for the rad weeknight happenings. Fire, fire.. To me it's all about the firepit. I love the outdoor seating patio w/heat lamps and firepit. Good Bartenders, decent drink selection and quality pool tables. During Happy Hour, as well as, Sunday and Monday you can get half price pool all night. &#160;They also have a dance floor with a cage, great people watching from the patio. I wish I could give the Ballroom 3.5 stars because I'm of two minds about it. &#160;Last Saturday my friends and I were headed to Norms and as we walked past Ballroom we realized there was a line at the door. &#160;What? we said. &#160;Who wants to go to Ballroom so badly that they will stand in a line? we said. &#160;Then we realized that the line was because all the guys trying to get in were being patted down, presumably for weapons since someone fired a gun on the sidewalk out front a couple of weeks ago. &#160;Inside it's kind of classy...but kind of in that "silk shirt and too much hair gel" sleazy kind of way. &#160;Cages in the back for dancing in, a table with a fire pit in the center, votive candles on every table, weird red lights...I just don't know how I feel about all that. &#160;BUT, 'all that' aside, Wednesdays are trivia nights and this place has the best trivia in the city (in my fine opinion.) &#160;The categories are great. &#160;The host is funny. &#160;(His stand-in last night though, not so much funny as obnoxiously wasted.) &#160;Of course, my team generally kicks ass and takes names so if you're thinking about stopping by (trivia starts at 9:00, buy-in is $5) really bring your game or prepare to go home disappointed after we stomp you. You'll notice the sleazy, bad vibes instantly, but you have to wait a bit to get a taste of the bad service. The entire back half of the building is filled with boys playing pool. Most of them look like they are seventeen years old. In order to get the bathroom you have to navigate through the upraised pool sticks that sometimes crisscross into a labyrinth of people setting up their shots. Seriously, the pool tables are crowded so close together that you have to either be rude and barge through or stop and wait for someone to take their shot to walk through to the bathroom. I was in one of the booths with two friends. As it was getting late, we told the waiter to close our tabs. When he returned with the receipts, I noticed that he had charged both my friend and I double for the same one drink. I pointed this out and the waiter went back to correct the mistake. I assume the best and think that it was an honest mistake. The waiter came back a few seconds later for clarification asking, "I'm sorry. I'll take off that extra charge, but remind me what was it you all had to drink again?"The guy we were with says patiently, "I had three beers, she had two [Random Girly Cocktails], and she had two [Mixed Drinks]"So imagine our surprise when the waiter came back with a big tray loaded up with three beers, two random girly cocktails, and two mixed drinks. We were dumbstruck. We had been trying to CLOSE our tabs for the past twenty minutes, a goal that was proving difficult due to his ineptitude (or intentional trickery?). We told him we didn't ask for these and we're not taking them. So, being consistent with the feeling that I'm in some parallel universe, the waiter shrugs, as if saying, "tough luck," continues to set down the drinks and walks away. I have to go up to him at the bar, and ask to see his manager. Finally we get it fixed, but it was so sleazy. FYI: It is ILLEGAL in the State of Washington to set three or more drinks at a time in front of a single customer. Went here last night and feel the urge to update. Uh oh. Well, I am subtracting one star because of the terrible bar service. My friend and I decided to get a drink at the bar where we were (not) greeted by two bartenders, who were talking to each other. My friend and I literally were standing there, right in front of them, with money, for like 5 minutes. They were pretending not to see us, I suppose. I can understand a small wait if you want to finish up your point really quickly, but do not just stand there talking like you are not at work. I mean, jeez. So finally one of them asks us what we want. She starts to make it, and then, about half way through (she was literally shaking my friends drink and stopped), she began talking to her friend again. It wasn't even like the bar was incredibly busy at that point. The two girls just wanted to talk to each other. It was irritating. And on top of that, they were rude and seemed irritated that we were interrupting their conversation. So, boooo on that! Thanks to the Yelp event held here, I finally got to see what all the hullabaloo was about. I enjoyed the atmosphere very much! There were plenty of pool tables, lots of space, a nice bar, and good service. The only issue that I had at the place was that the music was a little too loud for me to enjoy myself to the fullest extent... buuuuuut I can easily overlook that due to the good time that I had there.I'll definitely go there sometime in the future.
This is a solid place to get dim sum and lot more tables to seat you faster then most places.They have the standard dim sum like most places but they seem to have some different ones such as stuff tofu or little main course (salt n pepper squid). Also, if you don't see what you like on the carts...they are very accommodating to get you what you desire. I really enjoy eating their House Special Chow mein with my dimsum.The parking lot can be crazy on the weekends because it shares the parking lot with Viet Wah Market and Tonys but it is still better then parking in ChinaTown. The dinner food is okay but I really come here for the dimsum. I usually come here for dimsum every now and then. Their dimsum isn't bad and has gotten better throughout the years. HOWEVER, my last experience was HORRIBLE. Not only did they take forever to serve my friend and I but, as I was eating my delicious piece of chicken feet and submerging it into my chili pepper, which I had been doing with the rest of the food I had eaten, I noticed an odd piece of something in my pepper that I had just swirled my chicken feet on.... I looked closer and the first thing I noticed were the legs... I stopped... look again... WINGS? Omgosh I nearly threw up. I have no idea what it was but it was some sort of giant bug just laying there, dead, in the middle of my plate, with legs and wings just chillin' in my pepper. I had completely lost my appetite, which I was very upset about because I had been craving dimsum for a very long time. Now, I'm traumatized. I even feel sick everytime I come across the picture that I took of it - Yeah... I sure did. haha.This wasn't the only bad experience I've had here... there was another time that I had come for a late dinner with some family. Everything was fine until the rice incident. We saw the old lady pick up the rice container from a table that was just leaving, look in it to see that there was some rice left in there and she went to the back and added just a scoop to it then brought it to us... SERIOUSLY? You're going to bring us some other table's left over rice? I don't mean to bash on this place but I am only speaking from my honest experiences. I would only come back if I was desperate and lazy to drive elsewhere. Therefore, 2 stars given. It won't be my first choice for dim sum, but there wasn't a wait. That adds a star! At around 1:30pm there were still quite a few choices left--including some entree type dishes like honey walnut prawns. The room is quite large (and busy during these times), with padded upholstered walls and flat screen tv's. The selection wasn't all that I'd be after, but it IS Seattle. This wouldn't be my first choice for dim sum but it sure beats trying to find parking in the ID on the weekends.I usually go here for dim sum with friends on the weekend or on my lunch break. They are quick and friendly.The food is decent and hits the spot if I am craving dim sum. I like that they have a parking lot but it can be a nightmare to find a spot during Saturdays or Sundays because it is in a shopping center.If you want a quick fix for dim sum and not trying to drive into the city this is the place for you. My wife wanted to give it 5 stars, but I guess I am the russian judge. Awesome place!! This is the type of place I first had dim sum down in LA. I love the asians to white people ratio!!! No more House of Hong for us!!Taro was delightful!! Flavors were wonderful accross the board. The dim sum actually tasted better when it cooled down some, but it is VERY HARD trying to not eat good food when it is put in front of you!! It's roomy inside, even with the Sunday morning crowd. The parking lot gets crazy by noon though.The food is on par with Tea Garden and Jade Garden, but with a slightly wider selection. It's enough more of a drive that I'm unlikely to go down again. Usually come here on a Saturday for lunch. It get's pretty busy. I'm not a fan of their dim sum as much as their food off the menu. I've never had a problem w/ their soup. . Usually get the westlake or seafood soup. Their salt and pepper squid is crispy, seasoned well. . House chow mein is really good too, ask for them to make the noodles crispy- tastes even better. Love this place- but HATE parking. There is never parking around this time, people double park at the wrong areas. . On a busy day it will probably take you 20mins to find parking. Good luck! Joy Palace is our FAVORITE restaurant for dim sum!! The food is always fresh and delicious. &#160;Whenever we end up anywhere else, we always regret it. &#160;Joy Palace never disappoints us. &#160;They are always on point....we leave very satisfied and very happy. Recovering from flu and too tired to eat anything but jello, my husband and I still couldn't bear the thought of the sometimes chemical taste and desperate MSG hangover that we get from Venus, which is right near our house. &#160;So we tried Joy Palace ...and hooray!!The food (dinner menu) is fresh and natural, bright, crisp, and not over-flavored. &#160;The service was fast and friendly and of course, the price is great. &#160;I'm having the leftover hot and sour soup right now for breakfast and floating on a happy cloud because it is so tasty.Looking forward to trying the dim sum. &#160;Nom nom nom. One of our "go to" spots for takeout. We're fairly consisent with what we order: fried rice, Mongolian Beef, Sweet &amp; Sour or General Tsao's Chicken, Sole with Salt &amp; Pepper, Won Ton Soup. Everything isalways good. On the last trip, the rice was stale, however. I hate it when a place has rice that is stale or oil that is too old. So I hope this was a one-time oversight. If it happens again, I won't be back, as I have other favorite places to go.We haven't tried the dim sum yet, but want to since the place is always packed on weekends. I like the dim sum here and seafood. A favorite of mine.
LOVE this place. The owners are crazy friendly and will start to remember you after only a few visits. What do you want? Bahn mi, cinnamon rolls, cookies, smoothies? They've got that and it's delicious! One of the best cinnamon rolls I've had... I'll be changing my lunch plans today to include a stop by here just to get one. It's pretty obvious that they take pride in their product and customer service. I was a bit sad when I didn't think I had any sort of bakery action close to my work but then I discovered this little gem thanks to this app I have on my phone... called Yelp. Now whenever I need a pastry or a fruit smoothie I have only to drive a few minutes down the road and my life is complete. It's probably not good for my calorie intake but calories be damned! Put this delicious food in my face! STAT!Swing by luxurious Lake City Way and check this place out; it's worth it!I'm a fan! I had an amazing experience with this bakery yesterday. &#160;My husband and I wanted a small gender reveal cake to announce the sex of our baby. &#160;We went in around 11am with an envelope and had an amazing cake by 4pm the same day. &#160;The staff were all very helpful when taking the order to make sure they met our needs, and the owner even called once or twice afterwards. &#160;What made it really special was picking up the cake - the owner greeted my husband by name and was so excited for us, it made me just that much more excited. &#160;To top it off, the cake itself was beautiful and YUMMY!Great cake, fast turnaround, amazing customer service. &#160;I would definitely recommend! I was pointed in the direction of Lake City Bakery after my friend told me how delicous their banh mi sandwiches were so i just had to try for myself. The owners were really friendly and super helpful with helping me decide what sandwich i would like, needless to say i ended up getting their pork sandwich which is apparentally the most popular one. The price was decent and the sandwich was even better!! I will definetly be back!
My family's been coming here for years..as a matter of fact this is my first dim sum restaurant I remember going to when I was a child. &#160;Good dim sum and lots of options. &#160;They also have the chili oil with the chili flakes in it for dipping that my girl loves. &#160;We've tried others in the area and the other big players don't have the chili oil. &#160;So it kinda sets them apart from say Jade Garden which is also good. &#160;Next time try ordering the fried crispy noodles with the seafood on top. &#160;Pretty Tasty.The service was good, the dim sum was good, only thing I'd have to say is the pricing is a bit higher than Jade Garden. Came here for Dim Sum on Friday with my Sister and Lillian. They were having a field trip from an elementary school. Lots of little kids, but well behaved.STAFF: Were super friendly and attentive. Also had valet for parkingBATHROOM: DISGUSTING! Imagine what the kitchen would look like. One of the stall had piss and toilet paper sitting in the bowl, the other stall had the back top part sitting on the seat, and the toilet I used didn't flushed :(FOOD: It was inexpensive, but not the best. The tripes were too salty, the hakau was hard and crunchy! Yuck tasted like the shrimps were old in it. Not a single dish stood out for me to rant about.Will not be coming back. Good dim sum. Flavorful, and I liked it better than Jade Garden. First time, we were seated in a high traffic area. This last time, we were seated in what I called "the tables where they serve the white people," because we had waitresses trundling BBQ Pork and Humbow Humbow Humbow on carts by us infrequently.I want to be a little more adventurous, so I was informed to turn up my nose for the tables in favor of a booth of a table in the back. Four of us ate plenty for $67. Came here with some coworkers on the Saturday after Chinese new year. &#160;Great dim sum. &#160;If you've never been to dim sum they push around karts of food and you pick out what you want off the karts. &#160;I ate 5 roast pork buns and that was the warm up. &#160;The 'meat and potatoes' of your meal are going to be the shrimp balls (no, not that type of balls), dumplings, and a bunch of weird things you've never seen before and can't tell what plant or animal its from, but you can't some eating. &#160;I never eat dessert but I had 3 egg tarts. &#160;For six people and a kid the bill was only $60 and we over ate. &#160;Best brunch you'll ever have. Been coming here for years with my family. The best chinese food and dim sum in the state. Period. Pure excellence! http://www.ramenrater.com
The rules of Osaka (which I fondly refer to as "Scary Teriyaki"):1. &#160;Don't engage in conversation with any of the local flavor as you stand in line or wait for your meal.2. &#160;Forget the menu. &#160;Order the special. &#160;The last thing you want to do is stand there in front of the menu board, hemming and hawing, drawing the ire of everyone around you. &#160;Besides, the special is THE dish at Osaka, and the chicken flies out of there so fast there's no time for any nasty food bugs.3. &#160;Don't look around too much while you're waiting, or you'll see the filthy floor and the grease and grime hanging from the ceiling. &#160;Just keep repeating, "The grill is hot ... the grill is hot..."4. &#160;Order as though you were ordering from the soup nazi. &#160;"Special, to go" is all you need to say. &#160;In my case, I say, as fast as I can, "Special to go, extra Ranch, Diet Coke." &#160;That's about as much as they can handle.5. &#160;Get it to go. &#160;The one time I violated this rule I was hit on by a drunk and asked for money by a junkie, and I got to watch the women behind the counter kick out a prostitute.6. &#160;Bring a $5 bill. &#160;A few quarters too if you're getting a soda. &#160;No checks. &#160;No credit cards.7. &#160;Expect some jaw-droppingly good teriyaki for an amazing price! &#160;The chicken is lean and grilled to perfection. &#160;The rice is sticky and hot. &#160;The teriyaki is just the right blend of sweet and salty. &#160;The "salad" consists of lettuce leaves, but hey - ask for extra Ranch and it's a nice offset to the teriyaki.Scary Teriyaki is the best deal in downtown Seattle. This place sets the bar of expectations very early in the experience. &#160;After all, the &#160;sign outside displays that the "special" is 5$ - which leads me to believe that I have a general idea of what I am getting into: &#160;greasy chicken served over cheap rice with a mix of cheaper vegetables drenched in a sweet, sweet sauce.You give me that for my teriyaki meal, I am satisfied. &#160;Osaka gave me higher quality chicken, higher quality rice and lettuce with ranch sprayed on top (though a little light on the sauce)! &#160;The assembly line of chefs keep the traffic flowing so that even while busy, its a 5 minutes, in and out. Don't be too set back but the nickname, "scaryaki" ......it is not that bad......just dont talk to anyone else. I am a huge fan teriyaki. That said I have 4 words to say BEST TERIYAKI IN SEATTLE!!!!!!! I do not know if I would tell anyone to frequent this place at night time but if you are ever in downtown during the day and want some damn good teriyaki this is it. Bring cash no credit cards accepted at this place. This place is run by three women and boy do they get it right. There is something about this corner because both restaurants serve canned soda which is amazing.
The staff here is always wonderful, relaxed and friendly. In recent months, Tom (one of the owners) had expanded into the neighboring space and created a monster art piece of his own! Check it out. =)Awesome soup.Awesome subs.Awesome environment. It's a Vietnamese version of Subway! &#160;I came here during lunch. &#160;The to-go line was long and the seating area was packed. &#160;Fortunately I gawked at the menu for so long tables cleared up and I got a place to sit. &#160;I sat down and unfolded my orange menu. &#160;I knew I wanted egg rolls so I got that as my appetizer. &#160;I was torn between the rice bowl and the vermicelli bowl so I asked my server for advice. &#160;He recommended I have the vermicelli bowl since it was a warm day. &#160;I ordered it with chicken. &#160;As I waited for my food I peeked through a couple of square holes in a wall next to my table and noticed there was a booth which could seat about 6 people. &#160;I guess that would be a nice spot for groups that don't want to get interrupted by side conversations. &#160;My egg rolls came to the table. &#160;I was really impressed with the presentation. &#160;I was expecting just egg rolls on a plate but they garnished it with colorful veggies. &#160;The chopsticks were thin and light. &#160;They were tricky for me to use. &#160;I tried really hard to grasp those egg rolls. &#160;I tried not to make a scene like the one in Pretty Woman where she was trying to grasp the escargot. &#160;Well, I flicked my egg roll and it landed on a Seattle Mag page. &#160;So if you see oil stains on one of those pages, it was me. &#160;Next was my vermicelli bowl. &#160;It was brought to me pretty and perfect. &#160;I had to take hold of those evil chopsticks again. &#160;It wasn't so bad grasping the chicken but grasping those noodles was a chore. &#160;I ate what I could. &#160;I had the rest packed up in a to-go box. &#160;Everyone is talking about the Banh Mi. &#160;I plan on coming back for that. &#160;I won't have to use those darn chopsticks! The BBQ Pork sandwich is the shiznit. &#160;Go for it. &#160; Lots of folks come here to get their food to go and take their lunch outside to eat (when it's not raining) or back to the office. &#160;I, however, enjoy sitting in the booths that are perched up a few steps from the main entryway. &#160;There's free WiFi here so bring your laptop or ipad and get busy.Stellar service (with a smile) and delicious food and great atmosphere are what continue to bring me back to this great place. Got my Shrimp Rolls, Pork Sub, Chinese Herb Jello.... I ordered by phone at 7.15pm, they usually close at 7.30pm. The Boss Lady said, " Never mind, just get down here as soon as you can, we will wait for you"...... This is the way they run business-BRILLIIANT! When I got home, the rolls were as good as usual. The Pork Sub is FANTASTIC- crunchy carrot, radish, juicy meat, fresh cucumber and onion! Will go back there soon! Wow! Great sandwiches. I like the hamburger steak sandwich. These guys are great! Great food, better price, and the cleanest restaurant EVER! Thank you so much. One of my favorites! Really great sandwiches under $5 and super friendly service! This was recommended to us by the employees at the hostel where we stayed. The place does not look like anything really, except for the witty submarine logo. They were making some sort of Vietnamese waffles and it made the whole place smell absolutely delicious. The staff was very friendly, and we had no wait. The sandwiches themselves were surprisingly tasty and satisfying - on a true baguette, with well-cooked meat (the curry chicken was particularly delicious and tender) and an interesting choice of vegetables, among those pickled carrots and what I think was a turnip (maybe?) that gave a very nice fresh acid touch to the whole thing. Overall a great experience, would definitely recommend it to all people visiting Seattle who want a quick yet tasty lunch. Always fresh and always good! I love sub sand! I come here for lunch during work hours. They recently expanded so have more seating room but getting to go is pretty quick. They have at least 12 or more different sandwich meats to choose from, and they're all good! I have only had a few other non sandwich meals there, but they are all cheap and look/smell amazing!
Great place for lunch eating it there or to-go. &#160;When you order their Lunch Sushi Special they do a great job packing it, you even get the Miso, so many places don't include the Soup when you order to go. &#160;The Lunch Bento Box Special is very good too! :) &#160;The waitress is always very friendly and the service is very quick. Great little sushi place in Downtown Seattle, they have happy hour specials all day Sat and Sun! We had a little bit of everything, lots of rolls! Dragon roll is great, as is the Unagi roll, which is delish and really cheap at $3/roll.Great ambiance and nice service. I'll be back! Great happy hour menu that is available all day on the weekend!!Yummy!! One of a kind on Capitol Hill. &#160;The sushi is very fresh and well presented Decent Happy Hour spot on the weekend. Simple, basic sushi. Although, for some reason every time I've dined here I ended up spending a lot more than I expected. (My problem, not theirs!) The place itself is very cute and the waitstaff is nice. It's only a few blocks away, so I'm sure I'll pop in for something small now and again! So, the happy hour prices are great... but my friend and I weren't at all satisfied. We first started off with three rolls and a couple appetizers... i was still hungry. Then we ordered Chicken Karaage and another roll. Chicken was dry and I was STILL hungry. So we got our bill and said screw it, let's get a hot dog! I'm not a piggy. Atmosphere was quiet, cozy, and contemporary. &#160; The sushi was generous, of good quality, and the rice was well seasoned. &#160;We enjoyed our fried green tea ice cream. &#160;Prices were completely reasonable. &#160;Our service was excellent until the very end, when the single waitress working the restaurant got a bit backlogged and we waited about 20 minutes for the check. &#160;On any other day, we wouldn't have minded, but we were exhausted from a long day of traveling and were dying to get back to our hotel to sleep. &#160;Otherwise, great neighborhood sushi joint! I've been to Sushi Kanpai twice in the past couple of weeks. My first visit was good--it was with a large group and I had the tempura udon/California roll combination. The udon noodle soup was okay--not too salty, but I personally prefer just a touch of sweetness and there wasn't any there. The California roll was also okay--better than what you'd get from a grocery store take-out case, but definitely not the best sushi in town. Today I went with 3 others and was kind of disappointed. There was a gigantic fly buzzing our table--not the restaurant's fault, but distracting and icky nonetheless. I had the spicy tofu bento. It was okay--nothing spectacular. One of the people in my party ordered the sashimi bento. I tried a piece of the fish and it was nicely cut (thick) and cold, but it had a weird taste, like maybe they had the fish sprayed with lemon juice to reduce a fishy smell? It was probably fine and nobody got sick, but it was a little unsettling. There are not a lot of Asian food chocies in this area, so I'll probably go to Kanpai again. But I'd recommend staying with the cooked food and expecting an OK meal, but nothing amazing to write home about. The more traditional sushi rolls were ok, nothing special or nothing terrible. However the calamari was very good. Also recommend the volcano roll, which is unlike any sushi I have had before. My father got the lemon and garlic sole which was very tasty. If you are looking for you a good sushi or other asian food I would try this place. Sooooo delicious. Super fresh sushi served by friendly and efficent staff. It's always easy to get a table, and definitely worth the price. I came here with a friend for dinner one evening, before they left town and they were so bummed that they didn't have sushi this delicious in San Francisco. I live on Capitol Hill which makes it pretty difficult to get down here very often, but when I have the opportunity, I jump all over it! Try the Spider Roll!
I really like this place. &#160;Its not my be-all end-all of sushi restaurants, but its really good, fairly cheap, and the atmosphere is nice. It is &#160;small and cozy and tastefully decorated. &#160;And you really cannot beat the price for Belltown.I usually eat a roll, today was the las Vegas roll, tempura roll with unagi, cream cheese and avocado, and some sushi (usually salmon and albacore). &#160;Was pretty fresh and good quality. &#160;Its a great substitute for the upper priced places, as who can afford to eat there every week. Why is it that so many asian establishments go with the kiwi green and bright orange color scheme? &#160;seriously, anyone else ever notice this? &#160;anyways, the sushi here is pretty decent--nothing to brag about, nothing that purge about. &#160;price point is appropriate for the caliber of this sushi. I never have any complaints against the service, but the food is way too Americanized for my taste. Most of their rolls are deep-fried, with mayo or cheese, they even add macadamia nuts to their sushi! &#160;The food is creative but too heavy and lost its purpose of Sushi being healthy because they add so much unnecessary ingredients to it. This sushi bar is never crowded, the house sake (hot) is amazing, and the sushi is SO fresh. &#160;Happy hour prices kill - is it too good to be true? This is one of our regular places for sushi. The food is consistently great, the service is fantastic and the prices are reasonable. Definitely recommend it!
I think there is a new owner/manager at this Luciano's because prior to this I never had a complaint. I will never spend money here again.I ordered from this company a white spaghetti and a lamb gyro among other pastas and when I received the order the white spaghetti was a normal spaghetti which looked old and the lamb gyro had dry meat and looked terribly inedible. We called the restaurant as soon as we received the order was the person working could not give us any information on the supervisor and stated they would give us a call back. Almost an hour later, we received a call and was told that it was too late to get another sent to our home and that we would be credited a free white spaghetti and another gyro when we ordered again. My fiance called tonight (06/28/08, about 2 weeks from incident) and was rudely greeted by apparently the owner/manager of this location "George". He told us that he would not credit us almost $20 worth of food and he would only give us a discount if we purchased something else because the previous mistake was not his problem. My fiance, I was standing next to him as were other witnesses, told the "manager" that this was his problem because it was his store that had messed an order up and that the customer service was terrible and we wanted to know who to contact above him. He then started yelling at my fiance to the point where everyone could hear that was in the room the "manager" berating him saying that this was his store and he was allowed to handle problems the way he wanted. He then proceeded to yell more things which we couldn't understand then hung up the phone. I proceeded to call the store back and asked for a corporate number and he would not give me any information. He said he didn't have to deal with this that we couldn't do anything about it and to never call back and then proceeded to hang up on me. I called another location of Luciano's (in Lake City 2063676600) and asked for a owner or manager number and they gave me George's number (206-779-8854). I called this number and it was the "manager" which was yelling at us in the first place. Before I could get in a sentence asking for someone else he began to become extremely hostile and yell into the phone to never call here and even began cursing. Mind you, during this whole time neither I nor my fiance spoke in any hostility or rudeness yet this man was yelling/cursing at me. I told him I would contact the BBB if he did not give me a number to someone I could speak to calmly. He stated he didn't give "a shit" who I called and I could call the BBB or the police and it wouldn't do any difference and that our business wasn't needed there. He then hung up again. I looked through their website and there was no information for any customer service problems and then I proceeded to contact the BBB. I will never go through this company again with this new manager and I want something done to fix this disturbing display of rudeness and complete lack of customer appreciation.
Had the most divine lunch here this afternoon. &#160;Mike, the server was so charming he made our experience simply wonderful. &#160;His suggestion of wines topped off a delicious and delightful meal. &#160;This was our first visit and it certainly won't be our last. &#160;The ambience, the friendliness of the servers, and the outstanding food made for a memorable afternoon. &#160;BELLISSIMO! Favorite Seattle Italien &#160;place so far. Small restaurant~but very quaint and intimate. The service was exceptional and the server was able to help me experience new wines.The pasta was wonderful, perfect temperature, nicely displayed. I had the caneloni and my husband had the rigatoni~loved both of them. Flavorful! Can't wait to try it again Great food, ambiance and most importantly, service. We were surprised how good the food was at this small local bistro. Great flavors, really well prepared. Pricing was fair. Atmosphere was cozy and intimate and neighborhoody. I would definitely go there again. I had the bolognese which was very tasty and my husband had the veal which was excellent (ok, it was a little skimpy on the portion... but it was great). The small portions are amplified by the huge plates they serve in. With good that good, just give us a little more and we'll pay for it. We enjoyed. See you again soon. Went here on whim with a friend of mine. &#160;We were lucky that we got there early, because a half hour later it got full. &#160;The people were friendly and the service was good. &#160;I ordered the carbonara and my friend had the lasagna. &#160;What can I say, the food was really good and the whole experience was good. &#160;I would recommend this place to all my friends if they're looking for good Italian food. From the start to the finish this meal was off the HOOK! &#160;The bruschetta plate was tasty! &#160;The Tricolore salad - YUM! &#160;And the ravioli marsala - hoo wee. If I wasn't such a lady, I'd have had my face in the plate slurping up the sauce. My companion had the veal bracciole - his plate was empty after about 10 minutes. Mondello was worth every penny. &#160;YUM! &#160;I'll be back! Have a new fav on the menu Pollo al Carttco simply amazing , satisfying on many levels , keep up the great work . This neighborhood Italian eatery is about more than just food. &#160;The family that runs this restaurant really cares about the quality of their food and the happiness of their customers. &#160;My dad was in town for his birthday, and he wanted a simple meal of spaghetti and meatballs. &#160;He absolutely loved his meal, and he was especially excited for his dessert cannoli. &#160;I am disappointed that I don't remember the name of the gentleman that waited on us because he made our dining experience a great one. &#160;I'm not sure why individuals complained about the speed of service. &#160;Customers are not rushed through the meal, and I appreciate that. &#160;When my family goes out to eat, it is a time for everyone to get together and catch up with one another. &#160;If you wanted to be treated like family, Mondello's is the place for you.
DID YOU SAY STEAK?!!! &#160;Oh my God! &#160;Best steak I've had in awhile. &#160;Many Seattle locals recommend this Steakhouse as one the best and it definitely shows. &#160;I strongly advise making a reservation. &#160;We didn't make a reservation on a Saturday night, but decided to just eat in the lounge area (aka the Bar). &#160;The wait wasn't that long. &#160;We arrived at 6PM and we were seated within 45 minutes. &#160;Within that 45 minute time frame, we just sipped our Pepsi in a tall glass until they called us.This place is really classy. &#160;We felt really under dressed (polo and jeans), but they didn't discriminate. &#160;It's a "ritzy" place because any place with a COATROOM is sure to be a classy place. &#160;The host is in fact dressed in a tuxedo. &#160;That's classy. &#160;But for some reason, I felt very empowered to be able to walk into a classy place just dressed as your average Joe having a steak. &#160;I give this place props for that! &#160;The lounge decor is decorated with dark woods and bottles of alcohol stacked to the ceiling. &#160;It does in fact look like a bar you would see in Boston. &#160;Flat panel tvs broadcasting the current games. &#160;A typical gentleman's bar bustled with business men and upper class locals in the house for STEAK!I order the Prime Peppercorn New York Steak. &#160;It was cooked to perfection....medium well as I like it. &#160;I didn't feel like a filet, and didn't have the appetite for a porterhouse, thus the reason for choosing the New York. &#160;I highly recommend the Metropolitan Grill to anyone visiting Seattle if you're in the mood for excellent steak. &#160;It is worth the experience! There isn't much I can say about the Met that isn't already said elsewhere. &#160;They may not serve the best steak in the world, but it is very difficult (if not impossible) to find a better one in Seattle. &#160;Rich atmosphere, professional service, excellent food and a great liquor and wine selection. &#160;It does put a big dent in the credit card for dinner, but it isn't as bad for lunch.A quick story of my last visit - I couldn't quite figure out what I wanted for lunch so I asked the server to order for me. &#160;She asked a few questions and brought me their steakhouse salad that was fabulous. &#160;I was quite pleased and walked away happier than if I'd ordered for myself. Working downtown, I eat lunch here often. &#160;great choices and resonable lunch menu. &#160;Love the French Dip or try the chicken burger.Happy hour in the bar is also top notch. &#160;Lots of choices of liquor, and fun to people watch on 2nd during rush hour. &#160;Grab the front corner table in the bar if you can. &#160;Came in one time before a Seahawks game for a couple of stiff belts. &#160;The server mentioned that the Kobe beef burger (usually $14.00) could be had for the happy hour price of $3.95. &#160;If you haven't had this burger, its possible the best in town. &#160;Carmelized onions, cheese, and what the hell, throw some bacon on it for good measure. &#160;My cholesterol is usually dangerously low!! &#160;Wash it down with a couple of martinis and your good to go. Yum the Met. &#160;It is Pricey. It's is delicious. &#160;Did I mention it is pricey?I won't pass it on if any one wants to take me there, but if I am looking for a piece a good meat in Seattle and I need to dig into my own wallet, it is Jak's I go. &#160;Afterall, they supposedly get the same cuts of meat so why pay more? :D There's not much left to say about one of the bastions of upscale steak dining in Seattle. &#160;Pricey? Yes.Tastey? Yes.Can I get a better cut of me anywhere else? Probably not.Would Henry come here if he had to pay for it? No.Where would Henry go instead? JaK's. &#160;It's cheaper and it's the same meat.Anytime I can expense this meal, I'll come here. &#160;Just don't expect me to flex MY plastic in here. Lunch.Simple fish and chips, from their special. &#160;The oil was too hot so the breading was burned and fish overcooked. &#160;Or maybe the fish pieces just sat in the oil too long. &#160;Sad and tired fries that had obviously sat far too long. &#160;Maybe if they'd brought the fish out earlier the chips would have been better. &#160;The starter Ceasar was a little overdressed and mediocre at best.Free diet Coke's that came from a perfectly calibrated fountain.Companion had a Cobb salad. &#160;He managed to fill a scrap plate with unedible hunks of chicken that appeared to be from a stewing hen or maybe a goose. Overrated. &#160;When we used one of our fancy gift certificates here one year, I was pretty excited. &#160;I have never been here before.However, going in, this is not upscale, except for the prices. &#160;People are in ratty clothing, the chairs are gross, and everything is just... old. &#160;Steak was decent, but I've definitely had better (Union Square Grill, Morton's, Madison Park Cafe). &#160;If you like the ambiance of this place, save your money and go to Denny's instead. I like steak. A lot. Since I eat a lot of it, I know a good steak when I see it. The good, the bad, and the ugly. You get the picture. The Met's hovering around mediocre. You can definitely get a better steak at Daniel's, El Gaucho, or Ruth's Chris. I give it 3 stars because they do a pretty good happy hour. Large bar and lots of cheap eats. The mini steak sandwiches are well worth the small price tag. Just perfect.My bro, sister-in-law, and I all ordered filet mignon. &#160;My sister-in-law is pregnant, so she got hers well done. &#160;It was still fantastic (my bro says this is a sign of great meat and a great chef -- to be able to make a tasty well-done steak). &#160;My boyfriend ordered their porterhouse steak. &#160;The metropolitan size, which is huge. &#160;I can't remember when I'd ever had a porterhouse, but this was realllllly tasty. &#160;I mean, a huge cut of tenderloin and whatever's on the other side.We also split onion rings -- they are huge!!! &#160;One order was enough for the four of us. &#160;We also ordered their teriyaki filet appetizer, but it never arrived, which was fine b/c we had more than enough food.With regards to sides, I got creamed spinach. &#160;Perfect. &#160;My boyfriend got their twice baked potato. &#160;Delicious. &#160;My bro and sister-in-law both got mashed potatoes. &#160;Buttery and creamy (although, my boyfriend didn't love 'em).Drinks. &#160;I ordered a berry-tini to start. &#160;It's STRONG. &#160;I know it's a martini, but it's a *berry*tini. &#160;My boyfriend ordered a Mariner Martini. &#160;It was sweet and yummy. &#160;I made him swap drinks with me. &#160;With dinner we had a cabernet sauvignon -- my boyfriend ordered, so I'm not totally sure which one. &#160;Also, tasty.OK. &#160;DESSERT!!!! &#160;Cheesecake. &#160;Soooo good. &#160;It was light and creamy. &#160;And the raspberries were like heaven. &#160;It's a bit pricey, but totally worth it. &#160;And, really, not as pricey as one might think... &#160;I want to go every time I head to Seattle. Really the only reason why my boyfriend &amp; I could even afford to come here one night a couple years ago was because (I sh*t you not) he told his sister over the phone that he'd had a headache, and she promptly sent him a hefty gift card because she thought he probably had a brain tumor. &#160;Lucky for us, an aspirin solved his tumor issues. &#160;Unlucky for the sister, he may have to feign illness again very soon.Especially for us casual, jeans-wearing ladies, it's always nice to have a REAL reason to put on a dress. &#160;The Met was fantastic and did not disappoint on any level. &#160;The valet was quick and courteous. &#160;We were seated 15 minutes past our reservation time, so as a courtesy we were each given a free appetizer to choose (a nearly $40 freebie). &#160;The wine so delicious it lingered on the tongue long after the sip. &#160;And the food was absolutely to die for-- so succulent and perfectly done (fillet mignon= him; some sort of fish= me) that it melted in your mouth. &#160;And the dessert was almost too rich but also the perfect ending to the meal.Should the tumor reappear, I hope our luck brings us back to The Met. This place has an amazing happy hour. After work on Friday, I met my mom in the bar. I haven't had a good hamburger in a long time since I dont eat much red meat anymore, so I thought what the hell. I didnt know if it came with fries or not, so I ordered the onion rings as well. &#160;This was a damn good burger, damn good onion rings, and damn good (you guessed it) fries. I was very full and very satisfied.Zipzap Zubidy Bop! The Met has a great happy hour from 3-6 with a bunch of different apps and stuff to eat. &#160;I highly recommend the Works burger which is not your traditional happy hour special type of mini-burger. &#160;It's a full size burger with all the fixin's and a bunch of fries for like $5. &#160;I also appreciate the fact that they have Hoegaarden on tap! So if you live in Seattle and are looking for good steak, people rave about El Gaucho and The Metropolitan Grill..aka The Met, Met Grill, etc. &#160; &#160;Anyway, so I decided to go there for my birthday and see what all the fuss was about. &#160;Here's the good: &#160; The environment was very, very pleasant. Getting a reservation and being seated took no time at all. The service was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and quick, and the food quality was top-notch. &#160; &#160;The Bad: &#160; &#160; &#160;I've eaten at PRIME steak houses such as Spencers in Spokane, Chicago Chop House in Chicago, Circus Circus Steakhouse in Vegas (really doesn't belong in circus circus), Daniel's Broiler in Bellevue, and I think my all time favorite...Peter Luger's in Brooklyn. &#160;So I think I've had my share of good steak. Okay..yes the steaks at The Met was also very good, however the price I was not happy about for the size of the steak. When it comes to prime, all the listed steak houses pretty &#160;much get their steak from the same type of sources, organic, grain fed, PRIME grade, dry aged beef. &#160;When it comes to cooking, to tell you the truth, they don't vary much either, light salt and pepper, maybe a sauce, and grilled to perfection..the way these steaks are to be made. &#160; &#160; I ordered the large porter house for $80 at Met Grill, it was good, and it wsa around 48 ounces..yes pretty big..but I'm a carnivore..for the same price..I was expecting to get what I got at Chicago chop house for the same price, same quality, and same grade beef...a 76 ounce porter house..needless to say I felt somewhat cheated by metropolitan grill, but I guess you pay more for the atmosphere, which was better than chicago chop house..the service..around the same..what'd you expect from a top tier steakhouse. &#160;The Ugly: &#160; &#160; I decided it was a special occasion (my birthday). so i brought 2 bottles of fine wine I brought back from Italy. &#160;I forgot the special name for the server who specializes in wine and opened up my two wine bottles for my group. I was impressed that he looked up where it was from to tell us what to expect..However, I was not happy w/his constant smelling of the glass of wine before handing it to us..he had his entire nose in the glass...I mean i understand he's a wine connoisseur, but would you not be the least bit well..digusted by someone pretty much sniffing your wine glass &#160;by sticking their nose in the entire glass about an inch from the actual win for 2 minutes before handing it off to you to drink. &#160; &#160;Bottom Line: &#160;The Metropolitan Grill has great service, the atmosphere is wonderful. The quality is good as well, but i've also gotten the same quality but more quantity for the same price elsewhere, but it's still somewhat fair..unlike other places *cough* El Gaucho *cough*. &#160;Great place to impress a date. &#160;The constant sniffing of my wine was a &#160;little weird, and kind've disgusting..but I might find myself at Metropolitan grill in the near future. i came here to celebrate my boyfriend's graduation. i really enjoyed their calamari here and the filet mignon was pretty good as well. i was definitely stuffed after our meal. i'm a college student so the met is definitely out of my price range. however, on special occasions its a nice place to go to and splurge...i think ill take my boyfriend to outback the next time im treating him to steak... (jk..)-------------i've been to the met for happy hour a couple times and LOVE IT. i stuff myself silly everytime i come here for hhthe works burger = amazingone of my favorite happy hours in seattle! I'll start with the food...if you want a great steak in Seattle this the place to go. &#160;They start with great beef and cook it to perfection. &#160;Their sides and good too and their deserts are amazing. &#160;But more than the food, the atmosphere is the reason to dine at the Met. &#160;You are welcome in a tuxedo as well as jeans and a shirt. &#160;The staff is wonderful, attentive, and entertaining. &#160;They are pricey, but you get what you pay for. &#160;Great place to take someone special. The more I go back the more I slide on over to the seafood, the Australian Lobster and Tiger Prawn Scampi are beyond reproach. Sublime, in fact. And the Rack of Lamb is a underrated favorite for those who know what the hell is going on. This is the kind of place you go for a special occasion, order an expensive bottle(s) of wine and The Delmonico steak cooked medium. I would like to giv this place 3.5 stars but that option is not avalable. I had wonderful service and our waiter was great. The wine menu is great but I think over priced. My friend thought he was ordering a bottle but it was 27.00 for a glass of wine and it wasn't &#160;that good. 108.00 for there wine was not clearly marked on the menu. The food was ok. I have been here in the bar for happy hour and had some great food and apps. dut thought dinner was just ok. My rack of lamb was dry and unflavorful my friends steak and crab looked andf tasted godd .Thanks for the bite. So much better than my lamb.
3 Clone Soldiers walk into a bar. &#160;The bartender takes one look at them and asks them what they want. &#160;They all reply in unison "Nothing. &#160;We're clones".Didn't crack a smile at that? &#160;Giving your screen a look of "Really, Vader, really?" right now? &#160;Congratulations, you have the exact same look on your face the cashier at Ezell's Fried Chicken had the entire time Lady Vader and I were in front of her placing our order (sans stupid non-joke), as well as everybody else in the joint as we &#160;knocked another item off the Foodie 100 list.Anyhow, more on that later. &#160;This place is located in one of the more ghetto-fabulous parts of town. &#160;With the possible exception of their Lynnwood location, this is the worst of them in terms of surrounding area. &#160;Let's put it this way: &#160;In the time it took us to walk from the Deathstar in the parking lot to the front door, we were accosted by someone asking us for either spare change or a piece of chicken. &#160;Yeah, I get that times are tough because the Rebellion keeps using all of your hard-earned credits to pay for their war against me. &#160;But maybe a person shouldn't be wearing a brand new pair of Nike's when they're panhandling. &#160;But that's neither here nor there. &#160;Point is, ambiance? &#160;There ain't any.Friendliness or customer service? &#160;There ain't any. &#160;Advice what the best sides are and what tastes good besides the chicken? &#160;There ain't any. &#160;A place to sit down and eat your chicken? &#160;There ain't any.So why the 4? &#160;I'll tell you why: &#160;Because the chicken and the biscuits are frickin' amazing. &#160;Stormtroopers who find themselves on Death Row due to following my orders should order this as their last meal. &#160;It's stunning the amount of insolence I'll put up with when you at least hand me something delicious to compensate for it. &#160;Each piece is perfectly cooked, and the breading is fantastic on both the regular and cajun varieties. &#160;2 breasts can easily satisfy a hearty appetite (I'll leave you to concoct your own jokes from this statement; my gift to you). &#160;And if someone walked up to me and told me that the secret to why the biscuits are so delicious is because they are laced with the tears of tortured Gungans, I would believe it. &#160;As to the sides: &#160;Just be forewarned that when they say small side, they mean SMALL. &#160;We ordered small sides of corn and baked beans, and each tub was about 2 forkfuls. &#160;Good, but miniscule. &#160;The peach cobbler was substantial at the small size level, but it was fairly mediocre. &#160;Too much lard in it, peaches were obviously canned (I get that they are out of season, but in that instance, at least go with frozen). &#160;On the upside, they have fried okra, which made the Lady Vader squee (no, really, she literally "squee"'d - I guess she misses the South).One other complaint I do have is that it appears that all the chicken was sitting in plastic tubs near the deep fryer, but was not over any form of ice or cooling packs. &#160; I couldn't tell for sure, though. &#160;I don't know, maybe they just sell that much chicken to where they can get away with it, but it gives me some concern. &#160;If I end up with salmonella tomorrow, I'm calling the health department, going back there to carve all of them up just like I did the younglings after Padme dumped me....and severely reducing this review score. &#160;As it stands though? &#160;Spectacular fried chicken, and kudos to them for having the okra; so much so that I'm giving it a high rating in spite of its questionable location, the unfriendly staff, the small side portions, and the lack of any seating.3.7 Deathstars (rounded to 4) Is it bad to say that I'd rather have Popeyes? &#160;I mean, don't get me wrong, their fried chicken is perfectly moist, decently flavorful and most importantly, FRIED; but still, it could be better seasoned, and when I ask for spicy, dammit I expect some heat!Rolls = four stars; Baked Barbeque Beans = three stars; Carry-Out Only = half star deduction.p.s. My first night in Seattle, a local told me "you gotta try Ezell's. &#160;But don't go alone. &#160;Or at night." &#160;I laughed and went anyway- you know what, this place is far from hood. &#160;But then again, unless you're hardcore like us folks from The Go, you might reconsider. I'm a long time fan of Ezell's. Pretty much as long as I've lived in Seattle. I always get spicy, it isn't 'that' spicy unless you hit the bottom of the dredge. But it does a little bit of a kick. Definitely not bland and tasty. Their chicken is moist and succulent with a thin crispy coating that calls my name at times. Kimmmm Kimmmmm. Eat me Kimmmmm.I have to admit I love the fried gizzards and liver. Half the time that is what I get. The rolls are soft, sweet and fluffy. And last time I was there, I noticed they added fried okra. I love the "God" shirts. It takes a lot of balls sometimes to even whisper the word "God" in Seattle. And the people that work here are sometimes not the friendliest, but they are always so hard working and extremely efficient. Minus 1 star for sometimes there being no parking because they are just so dang popular and I'm not too crazy about the sides. Especially the Mashed Potatoes. But they are made from REAL potatoes. Just not too much of a fan of their version... This sh!t right here! This sh!t right here! Is FIRE!I think I might know of a secret ingredient Ezzels uses inn there oohh so famous spicy fried chicken... its LEMONGRASS... I'm Chinese with a complex palate and to my goodness gracious truth, I can taste lemongrass in the spicy chicken. I've eaten there for many years now and I am certain, oother than that I LOVE Ezells!!! I was sure we weren't that close to the water, but some probably inbred and definitely fried-chicken-eating seagulls were hovering around the bins, waiting for scraps of spicy batter to fall off my two fisted clamp on my piece of dark.You ain't getting any, dirty birds!But it's hard to ravenously gorge and not lay waste a crumb or two, which unwastefully ends in the maw of the bird.While trucking over, my gal kept saying, "you eat, I watch. I don't eat the fried stuff". 20 minutes later, she was eating the fried stuff. "this is pretty good", she say. "It may not be that unhealthy".Wishful thinking. Delusions of healthiness aside, the chicken was pretty good, although not what-i'd-imagine-thomas-keller-fried-chicken-to-be great. Yeah, pretty good. The sweet potato pie was pretty good too. We are big sweet potato people (mostly of the baked and boiled variety), so that was a treat.Service was nice and friendly, and we got there right before the lunch crowd. I'd have preferred it as a late night bite but I could still feel it at the bottom of my stomach by then. Ezell's fried chicken is delicious.I went here with a group of friends and we all ended up getting the 2-piece meal with two sides. I got the regular fried chicken.This fried chicken isn't any ordinary fried chicken that I've tasted. The breading is crunchy and the meat is moist. The breading is also well spiced and adds an extra layer of flavor to the chicken. It's a crunch in your mouth followed by a blast of delicious flavor. And even if the chicken is fried, it's not as greasy as one would expect fried chicken to be.The sides were also pretty tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary. The fries are crinkle cut and prone to getting soft. I didn't mind, but I know that some might get annoyed by the soggyness. I also had a taste of the baked beans; sweet, but the taste was not distinguishable from canned variety I've bought at QFC.Meals usually also come with a sweet roll. It's a great complement for soaking up all the oil you just ate! There's no place to sit in this location so plan to take your order to go.There's not a lot of parking, but I don't think it'll be hard to find a space considering this is not a sit down location.Considering there are not a lot of fried chicken locations in the Seattle area, it's great that Ezell's is very much on point with their chicken. Still amazing. I've been dreaming about this chicken. &#160;It's the best friend chicken I've ever had. &#160;Just writing this is making me think about that chicken and I am tempted to run, RUN!, to get MORE CHICKEN.Sides are decent, but IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CHICKEN. Location, meh. &#160;Spicy fried chicken, AWESOME! &#160;The first time I had Ezells was leftovers from my boyfriend and I didn't think so much of it then. &#160;But finally, we got fresh Ezells--spicy chicken strips, biscuits, mashed potatoes, coleslaw, the works--and OMG I couldn't stop eating. &#160;I never knew that Fried Chicken could be so deliciously crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. &#160;The biscuits were fluffy and buttery! &#160;Humorous note about the location. &#160;As we were leaving, a bulleted car pulled up behind where we were parked and asked this girl for her #. &#160;I was in the car secretly watching this interaction, but from the looks of it I think he succeeded! &#160;See now, Ezells is also bringing people together! The spicy chicken strips were very tasty. Lots of grease, lots of chicken strips for a half pound order, but not much spice in what was supposed to be spicy chicken. The coleslaw tasted about the same as that from Kentucky fried chicken. Nothing special. The corn tasted okay. Nothing special. The bread roll was so-so. The best side treat was the sweet potato pie which was very good, and I highly recommend that as a desert. Overall, Ezell's was okay. Ahhhh yeahhhh! I love fried chicken. I love spicy fried chicken from Ezell's even more! This place does it right- cheap, tasty, and you get a fluffy roll on the side (I ate mine on the way to my car). And for all of you that pick off the skin... WTF? Isn't that the best part? Just sayin'. Lived here almost all my life and i have only eaten the chicken strips and rolls, The rest of the chicken portions are unnaturally huge.the rolls are awesome opossom though. Straight up legit fried chicken. I'm sure everyone can count of the food being awesome, but go there and buy food even if you have your doubts cause the experience can be life-changing as well.My friend and I walked into the building and were already expecting OG fried chicken because of the decor, but the homeless dude trying to sell us a stolen Mariners backpack and then turning around to leave revealing that he was sagging without underwear... I will never forget Ezell's and Seattle. God bless America. More of a 3.5/5 review. I'm not a huge fried chicken fan, but Ezell's is pretty darn good. This is far better than KFC (although I do love their biscuits). The rolls here are really tasty and the chicken is succulent! Also, I don't know what it is about the baked beans here, but I LOVE THEM! I could eat them nonstop for days. I absolutely love fried chicken, especially the type with the succulent meat and the well-seasoned crispy skin. &#160;So when I heard that Ezell's is the place to go for this type of fried chicken, I had to check it out. &#160;I'd give it an A-OK rating because I feel that although it is delicious, it's lacking something. &#160;I've been by all three locations (Renton, Skyway, and Central District, mostly). &#160;The service is always nice and fast. &#160;I do enjoy the variety of sides they have to accompany their main dishes. &#160;If you go, be sure to try the fried okra and their best side.....THE ROLLS! &#160;They make these rolls to perfection. Just stopped in there today for the first time with my family, because I heard that Oprah liked this place so much she has it flown to Chicago when she wants some. Ordered:16 pieces of spicy fried chicken (came with 6 rolls)1 sweet potato pieThe chicken was so moist! On the ezell's website it says the chicken is marinated for 24 hours before its cooked. You won't be sorry about ordering the chicken, because even my wife said "there is love in this chicken". Spicy was enough to taste the spicy, but it wasn't fire hot. It was just great. The size of the chicken pieces is much larger than other chicken places, because on their website, it says they cut the chicken into 8 pieces, where other chicken places cut them into 9. Also, Ezell's uses 3-pound chickens, where the other chains use 2-pounders. THE SWEET POTATO PIE WAS AWESOME! The rolls were awesome. The rolls aren't so spongy, as they are creamy. &#160;We ordered the whole pie, and it was so good that we consumed it as soon as we got home. You can't eat there, because it's strictly take out, but don't let that stop you from going here because you won't like any other fried chicken afterwards. Whoever is knocking this place in stars because of decor, ambiance or not having a place to sit needs to go order elsewhere because that will leave more leftovers for those people who love this place...Will definitely be back soon! This is the best fried chicken I have ever eaten. I would come here more often if I felt more safe in the neighborhood. Ezell's, please open a location on the Eastside! I love fried chicken and this sure does hit the spot!Spicy fried chicken here is http://bomb.com by far one of the better spots in town to get chicken. Their rolls are not so bad either.Service was friendly and quick just the way I like it.YUMMO Ezell's was our last stop before heading to the airport. &#160;I got a spicy breast and drumstick with coleslaw and potato salad. &#160;The chicken was juicy and flavorful enough for me although I didn't find it spicy. &#160;The sides were ok but not special. &#160;I would request that Ezell's be included in any future Seattle trips. This is Ezell's chicken we're talking about here. &#160;How have you not heard of this place? &#160;Why are you wasting your time reading reviews of this place? &#160;Go eat there now!Seriously, best fried chicken in town. &#160;Anyone who tells you otherwise has NO idea what they're talking about. &#160;It's all about the bun and getting it spicy. &#160;Trust me, get it spicy. &#160;The spicy has much more flavor. &#160;As far as the sides go, who cares about the sides? &#160;They're ok, but the chicken is as good as it gets. &#160;P.S. &#160;Get it spicy. A little bit too much batter on the chicken for my taste. I have tried it a few times to make sure it was good or not. Seems each location is a little bit different in my opinion. Seattle ain't a midnight kind of town when it comes to satisfying the munchies. In the desperation only felt when you're staying at a discounted Holiday Inn, Jamie W. and I wanted a procrastinator's dinner but found few options open past 9AM. I found Ezell's on the Yelp list for late-night eats, so we trundled off into the dark unknown of the Central District.Upon first sight, Ezell's really looks like a converted Church's franchise. Upon second, third and fourth look for that matter. They even offer original recipe and spicy crispy options like any fast-food chain. The staff is genuinely friendly for a group surrounded by used frying oil, and there were so many variations on fried chicken parts that I was like a kid in a poultry slaughterhouse. Jamie went straight away for the $5.49 basket of Chicken Strips which satisfied his McNugget fix (see photo).I was torn since my default order at $7.59 is the combo two thighs and drumstick with cole slaw and dinner roll (see photo). However, I was also tempted by the $3.49 half-pound order of Fried Gizzards (see photo)... yes, Fried Gizzards, which I grew fond of at Harold's Chicken Shack near the University of Chicago campus. Memories. So I got both, dammit, and stop judging me. Thems gizzards were chewy good especially doused with hot sauce, and the dark meat pieces were fine although honestly nothing you couldn't get at a Church's franchise. By the way, you can't eat there. You wouldn't want to anyway.FOOD - 3 stars...good chicken, great gizzardsAMBIANCE - 2 stars...rows of florescent lights and running chickens hand-painted on the windowSERVICE - 3.5 stars...a friendly crew who gets alongTOTAL - 3 stars...pretty good considering the fast-food vibe Nom nom nom... fried gizzards. &#160;nom nom nom. &#160;Okay, not only is the fried chicken to die for, like the perfect amount of crispiness but not too crispy to where it makes your mouth hurt when you eat more than one piece, but the chicken itself is actually super moist and juciy! &#160;It's not dried up and over-cooked like the other fried chicken places!!! &#160;I love this place.Okay, now on to my favorite thing, fried gizzards. &#160;Don't tell me what gizzards are because I really don't want to hear anything that will deter me from eating this fried gizzards, as I can eat them all day (but I won't because i'll probably get really sick, or have a heart attack or something chronic). &#160;Now a lot of you may actually not ever want to try fried gizzards, because either you know what they are or just don't like the sound of them, but I'm telling you to go try them! Especially the spicy kind, because those are the best. &#160;Now when you order the gizzards, make sure you order them FIRST, because I was a noob once and ordered them last and the lady scolded me because they take 10 extra minutes to fry than all the other things.All I can say is YUM! It's a decent place to go for fried chicken if you want quick take out. I like the spicy and it's not that spicy. I usually pick up a meal pack for a potluck with a couple sides and the rolls. The sides aren't so good and the corn is soggy. The mashed potatoes is my favorite side but the gravy is just so-so. The rolls are great. I had just finished running 5 miles, and my sweat was on like Donkey Kong after lifting some serious weights. I was exhausted and thirsty and in need of some serious rejuvenation...So I went to the no-nonsense, you-better-know-what-you-want-to-order-ASAP Ezell's in the Central District.I know what you're thinking..what a waste of exercise..but don't you sit there and judge me from the safety of your computer! If you were 1/10th as hungry as I was, you would have AT LEAST eaten a doughnut to reward your gym efforts.I was tired and hungry and on the verge of some serious crankiness, so you best believe I stuffed my face with 1/2lb of spicy chicken strips, potatoes and gravy, and a fluffy ass roll. And 5 miles be DAMNED because I enjoyed every single bite of my meal, and I'm definitely going to do it again. You know how Yelp asks what your last meal would be? It might not be Ezell's, but if it were I'd be satisfied. Their fried chicken is truly sublime: crispy and flavorful skin (go for the spicy) with delicious tender meat (I'm salivating just thinking about it). Not to mention the sides: their rolls are delicious and I highly recommend the sweet potato pie. Look for the picture of Oprah on the wall, she's a big fan -- and so too will you be after your first bite. Ezell's is a no-frills kind of establishment: you order your food, you go. But their service is almost uniformly polite and prompt and there's none of the "unless you're a regular you won't know what you're doing" pressure of some other places. Ezell's is a friendly place.But back to the chicken. Do yourself a favor and just go right now. If you've somehow managed to choke down KFC all these years without ever having a proper drumstick, then I pity you. But there is hope and it has several locations in the Puget Sound area. Hey if you like fried chicken you have to try this place. It has the best Fried Chicken it also is Oprah's favorite the have a picture of her in the restaurant. Check it out!! The Butter rolls are good too. One should onlyl eat here like once every 3 months, or you will become a fatty mcfat-fat. BUT IT'S SO GOOD!Sometimes I just want to order a big bucket of rolls and hug them, but dont' want people to look at me funny. They're THE BEST!Spicey chicken is my favorite. After reading reviews that they have chicken strips, i may need to go back to investigate.The smell lingers in your car for about 4 blocks after you drive by.They also carry Faygo, for all your Insane Clown Posse needs :) Note: you can't actually eat at the 23rd ave location. Carry out only. I love this place.Moving closer to it's location in the CD will make it though for me to stay away. I have never been disappointed with anything that I have had here. The fried chicken is fantastic, the rolls are to die for, and the sweet potato pie is the best end cap to the meal. Also, the service is fast and if they're out of something the'll let you know and offer to swap it out for you right on the spot (or you can also wait for a fresh batch of what you ordered).There really isn't any seating on site, but it's great to take it to go and head to the park and just lay out, eat some fried chicken and enjoy. Once every couple months, around 3:27am, I'll think about how good this fried chicken is.How good is it you ask?Good enough that every couple months it'll haunt you at 3:27am is the answer to that.I've had fried chicken all across the country, from good ole soul food down south, to japanese style wings on the east, to homestyle fried thighs in the north, but this is the spot that comes to mind when I think of fried chicken.Delectable stuff. Ok...so I had to give it another try. &#160;This time we ordered a pound of fried gizzard and one fried chicken leg. &#160;The fried gizzard was good. &#160;I don't normally eat gizzard and I thought it was good. &#160;The chicken was good, but lacking in flavor. Just when you think you've seen it all, something happens to remind you that it's just not true. &#160;Case in point - Ezell's Fried Chicken.For some unknown reason, I had a craving for fried chicken. &#160;A Yelp search led me to Ezell's. &#160;The closest one was in the city, so I made a late night trek.I ordered the four piece original dinner, which comes with two small sides (I chose potato salad and corn) and a dinner roll, and a small peach cobbler. &#160;With tax, it costs over fifteen bucks! &#160;That's steep, especially in that area. &#160;(Let's just say I'm not in any hurry to walk around the neighborhood.) &#160;Under normal circumstances, I would have walked right out. &#160;However, I had driven a long way and I wanted to satisfy my craving.The chicken was nicely breaded and juicy, but here comes the kicker. &#160;The fried chicken tasted like it was completely bereft of salt. &#160;WTF?! &#160;Whoever heard of fried chicken that NEEDED salt?! &#160;I couldn't believe it. &#160;I'm sure there was salt used somewhere along the line, but I was unable to taste it.The potato salad was decent, except it also needed salt (?!). &#160;The corn came straight out of a can, or at least it seemed that way. &#160;The saving grace of the meal was the peach cobbler. &#160;Fantastic. &#160;If this place was Ezell's Peach Cobbler, I'd give it four or five stars. &#160;Ezell's Fried Chicken gets only two. &#160;Even if it had a proper amount of salt, I wouldn't consider it to be significantly better than any of the chains. &#160;At those prices, it damn well should be. The original fried chicken spot in Seattle since I was a kid.. At one point Oprah used to have their fried chicken personally flown to her.. But I recommend the spicy chicken and order extra rolls cuz they're good! The sides are alright in my opinion, but if you want dessert, I recommend the peach cobbler! That is some good fried chicken let me tell you. &#160;No wonder Oprah likes it so much! Spicy chicken is the best. &#160;If I could I would eat here everyday.
Best pho I've found so far (the Than Bros. on Aurora out by PCC is fine if you're in that 'hood) in town, since getting hooked on the junk three years ago or so. Good broth, everything seems fresh, they're happy to cater to special little requests (adding people to the party after we'd already seated, custom changes to the dishes), and the complimentary tea is a nice touch. A short trek from the Hill to Jackson &amp; 14th-ish, totally worth it for the quality upgrade over most of the places on Broadway.
So I've never been here before, so I decided to give their buffet a go.How was it?Well..... I got full?Before entering, I checked what their drink special is today. Turns out Friday is Jagermeister day. No, thanks.... probably a good thing, anyways, because I don't need a drink today. Not &#160;yet, anyways.So I step inside, waitress says "Buffet?", I say yes, sit down, and am immediately given a plate. I go to grab some food and am not super excited by the presentation, but I'm hungry and optimistic. I fill up my plate, wonder about the hummus and stuff in the middle and the lack of pita, and head back towards my table (which now has a glass of water, napkin, and fork). The whole time I was kind of wondering what kind of cuisine this was supposed to be. It made me think of both Middle Eastern places and places serving Indian food, but the only specification I've gotten is "vegetarian" and possibly "vegan."I start eating and... well, my taste buds did not really get any stimulation. Everything tasted bland and kind of the same to me, which I was especially disappointed with while eating the eggplant dish. So I went back for more and eventually discovered the bags of pita bread on top of "roof" of the buffet container. I also couldn't find any replacement plates, so my plate just kept getting more and more different sauces in it (and none of them really had distinct flavors for me). I really didn't like their hummus, but that's perhaps because of the amazing hummus I've been eating recently.Service: My only interactions with the waitress were getting a table and paying my bill. My water never got refilled and I never got any kind of offers to get anything besides water to drink, which I was slightly disappointed about. (Made me realize that, while I don't like restaurant staff constantly checking on me, I really do like it when they do it at least once and/or strike up some kind of dialog.)Over-all it was okay, but I'm not that happy with their buffet. I might consider trying dinner there sometime.Now I want a nap and really wish I had time for one. I went to Flowers the other night for dinner and drinks- after passing this restaurant 100 times and not giving it a second thought. &#160; &#160;The restaurant was very dark and only lit by streaming christmas-like lights. &#160; But I liked the mood it set and would recommend it to people who want a very subdued and quiet evening. The drinks were reasonably priced and the food was pretty good. &#160;We ordered the hummus appetizer and a sampler appetizer. &#160;That was more than enough for two people. Unlike some other reviews, I did not have any problem with the speed of the service. &#160;The waitress came by a couple of times to check on the drinks and make sure the food was satisfactory. &#160; When I needed the bill it was there is a few minutes. &#160;Flowers is not the best restaurant in town, but it has a unique quality that would attract me back for dinner and drinks again. Meh. &#160;This place is ok. &#160;I've been here once before and was equally unimpressed. &#160;Maybe I need to come here and have a cocktail w/ my meal? &#160;I'm not sure.The service was kind of slow - however I have to say that our server was very very nice and I liked her...but it was super slow. &#160;It took forever for me to get my SALAD (how hard is it to put greens, walnuts, dressing, and gorgonzola together) and when that was done it took another round of forever to get our bill.sigh...Maybe I should stop in when I'm already sauced so I won't know the difference. Flowers (as a bar):OK, so Flowers is very dark at night, has TERRIBLY SLOW service, so-so drinks, average prices, non-illuminated sign, grab bag patrons, mirrored ceiling, and did I mention slow service? &#160;But my friends and I keep coming back. &#160;Flowers is great because it is the only bar on the Ave not packed with douche bags. &#160;We love to walk to Flowers for a bloody marry and laugh about how awful the service is. &#160;The slow service used to affect our tip generosity, but now its understood that one must wait 5 minutes for a drink, and it's kinda' funny. Had lunch here last week. &#160;Amazing salad. &#160;Grilled chicken, gorgonzola, balsamic, delicious. &#160;Really heavy though, a lot of chicken. &#160;I was uncomfortably full when finished. &#160;But I suppose that was my own fault for eating the entire thing, right? &#160;I'll be back to try the buffet, it looked pretty good. &#160;The service was quite relaxed (read: slow), but I got my water refill when I needed it, so it was all good. &#160;All in all, Flowers is a pretty laid back place with great food. &#160;I'll be back. I must admit that I haven't &#160;had the lunch buffet.I can say however in the five or six times I have been here I have asked myself the same question with all of my drinks: where is the alcohol?I am not a heavy drinker in the least bit and often ask my friends to confirm that there is indeed a severe lack of alcohol in my beverage. I really want to love flowers. The ambiance is nice, and I think the waitstaff is fantastic considering this is the ave, they always seem to know when I need a new drink and don't come around and bother every five minutes like other places.If their drinks were better I would be there all the time. One of the best vegetarian lunch buffet in town.
I cannot comment on the restaurant or the food but you do not need to worry about such things if you keep your eye on the prize. Once you discover the magical red door which takes you to the bar with no windows you will not be thinking about food. The bartender, upon our entry and ordering of a round of drinks that were nearly void of mixer, insisted we do shots. She came back with rocks glasses filled to the rim and the statement that she made them extra big to get us extra fucked up. Only then did we realize we would need the drinks to handle seeing the fat dude across the bar lifting his shirt and doing a belly dance for his girlfriend 20 years his senior as he felt her up. If tales of the drinks and clientele weren't enough to lure you to this awesome establishment perhaps the decor will push you over the edge. This is the only place I have ever seen wood panelling inlaid with red velvet. I don't want to spoil it for you so I will leave the rest of the awe inspiring interior touches for you to discover on your own.... at 7AM, when they open (I know it doesn't open at 6AM but the awesomeness of this place is deserving of a spot on my early morning drinking list).I am pretty sure this is where alcoholics with questionable taste go to die. It is definitely their happy place, you can see it in their one good eye. After experiencing its glory it might be mine, too. Skip the restaraunt and just dare to walk through the red door.Scary wicked rum and coke. In the "I am a career alcoholic with a Master's in Maintenance and a BA in Hair of the Dog" way.Fan-suck-tastical decor. The murals. The velvet/glass/things. On the Riss-dive-bar meter, this is almost as awesome as The Dome. On the Pub Crawl list of bars this was by far teh best Dive bar we landed in.The Bar was small enough that when we walked in it felt like the party preceded us - so very good energy I must say. &#160;But the decor. &#160;A wall to wall painting of the Classic Musical "Showboat" theat made "Old Man River" so very famous - if you do not know this song, please do not admitt it. &#160;If you got drunk enough the picture of the river was was large enough to make you seasick! &#160;It was fantastic!My one regret in this place was Xav was whipping off her coat to teach us all a nifty dance step to the song that was on and the song ended - so we missed the step. &#160;Way big bummer!As dive goes - Great! Once order delivery from here. &#160;Food ordered was Kung Pao Chicken, pot &#160;stickers, fried rice, sweet and sour pork.Didn't know that white rice doesn't automatically come with the entrees.Got the food quickly. &#160;But, the food was mediocre at best. &#160;I'm not sure if what I was eating was really chicken. &#160;The pot stickers were homemade (+) but they lacked proper seasoning (- - ). My friend was also not that impressed with his dish, either. I felt a little sick after the meal (food poisoning?). &#160; My fiance, who ate some of the leftovers, also reported that he felt a little off after eating the food.If you are looking for delivery, I recommend Genghis Khan Restaurant over Golden City. &#160;The food is simply better and they don't skimp on veggies like Golden City appears to. Yes! What a great dive bar. Strong drinks, random drunkards. Good times. Stop in just to check out their mural.I'll stumble in &amp; out of this place a few more times. Dear Golden City,Why must you torture me with your delivery radius? &#160;You'll come all the way out to Magnolia just to bring me bad Chinese food.I'm pretty sure you only make about 3 different items and just name them different things on the menu. &#160;How many variations of deep fried chicken bits with miscellaneous sauce have you brought to me over the past year? &#160;How much sliced garlic can you put into each dish? &#160;And for the love of God, how is it with all the bad entrees you can actually make a tasty Hot and Sour soup? - Best Chinese food in Ballard- Most unappreciated restaurant in Ballard- Do not go into the bar areaFood: 8/10- They have crab cheese wontons, which I love.- The portions are HUGE (2-3 meals worth of leftovers from the family style)- The sauce on the General Tao's (not Tzu) is just right (dark red and spicy) and they used white meat chicken too.- Kung Pao Chicken was excellentService: 10/10- Our waitress, Jenny, was absolutely terrific. Very charming, pleasant and super helpful when it came time to discuss which version of the General Tao's Chicken to go for (deep-fried or non). I had the deep-fried, but the breading is kinda thick so I might recommend the non-deep-fried.- Everyone who worked there seemed really nice and honestly happy to see us... did I mention that we were the only people in there on a Friday night at 6pm?Decor: CleanIt's not a fancy place by any stretch, but it is clean. Very clean. I cannot tell a lie, when I am in the mood for Chinese I can't help but go and get an order of the General Tso's. Get it stir fried, not deep friend and take it home to eat it in shameful happiness. Sometimes you just need a little Chinese-American fix. The best Chinese restaurant in Ballard. Hands down!!! &#160;Who needs Bal Mar or The Matador when you got Golden City. The night life is always kracken with good music and lively people. But the best time of &#160;the day &#160;is in the morning, that's when all the fisherman head over to GC to get their drink on after early morning fishing.As for the food: I've only had it when I was extremely inebriated. But I do recall my friends and I had their family menu, which includes soup, appetizers and a variety of main dishes including fried rice, all for less than 10 bucks each.I would recommend the Honey Walnut prawns.
Why can't you access them on Google street view? It's not like it's in Medina or Yarrow Point... Weird. If I come back I'll take a picture of the exterior unless another Yelper stops by and takes the snapshot. This is a good restaurant if you're tired of the Mazatlan's, Puerto Vallarta's, and Azteca's. However, the square footage is a lot smaller. I guess people assume they'll get a table right away but in reality they'll probably have to wait if they come after 5pm. You'll get complimentary chips and salsa. If they ask you if you want guacamole keep in mind that it's an add on, not complimentary. I had the Burrita Le&#241;era. It had a little spicy kick to it. I couldn't eat all of it. It was huge! I'd really like to try the one on Alki but I think I'll wait till summertime. I decided to try this place again since we were in the neighborhood, and it was MUCH better this time around (much more like the Alki location that I know and love). The service was outstanding -once again. The Navajo torta was bland, but had good texture. The butternut squash enchilada though!! MMMMMM!!! This is one of about three vegetarian options here, but this one is the best!! Such good flavor in the sauce! Last time I was here they must have put the wrong sauce on or something because it didnt taste delicious like this did!The charred asparagus had just enough zing to make them interesting -very tasty and light. Good, fruity iced tea too. Not sweet like fruity iced teas can be sometimes.. After a burning craving for some great Tex Mex, we found ourselves at the Madison Park Cactus which really is my favorite Cactus location. &#160;It's located in the charming and quaint Madison Park area with a really nice vibe, which on a summer's night can be pretty perfect!The restaurant was packed as Cactus usually is so we spotted a table in the bar area just next to the open window which had a fantastic breeze and nice view of the Madison Park happenings. &#160;We quickly agreed this was as good as it gets. It was lovely.We started off with drinks, our friends ordering some margaritas, the Baja (with jalapenos) and some other fruity cocktails along with guacamole for our tortilla chips. The guac was pretty tasty with a nice zing to it. For food, we ordered a half order of the nachos (I am ALWAYS such a sucker for nachos) and my husband ordered the Grilled Portobello-Vegetable Escabeche Fajitas. So he has made the official claim and announcement, those fajitas were by far the best he had ever had... IN HIS LIFE. I've heard him mention the fajitas several times this morning and it's only 10AM.Busy and obsessed with my nachos which had roasted corn, melted cheese, pico de gallo, buttermilk crema, and guac I took a small bite of his fajitas and I could see why he'd make such a big important statement. The portabellas could not have been anymore well- seasoned and had a really nice and gentle kick with a touch of lime towards the end. So, Cactus - yep I'm a pretty big fan and this particular location remains to be my favorite spot, though I'm excited to see the South Lake Union digs which is opening soon.A solid spot for some fresh and tasty Tex Mex food! Very good food, very good service. &#160;We even saw the waiter at a different location a few hours later and he recognized us and thanked us again for coming in. &#160;That is dedication to service. &#160;Also, after all was said and done, the manager came over and brought us free flan. &#160;We didn't see this coming, but we definitely enjoyed it.I normally don't want to spend too much on Mexican food, and especially don't want to pay for chips and salsa, but this food was worth it and still not as much as you will pay at some sit-down Mexican places. &#160;And the chips and salsa were apparently bottomless (and didn't end up on our bill).The portions were very filling without being grossly large, but the flavors were incredible and unique. &#160;Go to Cactus, sit outside if you can, get a drink, try their specials, and enjoy yourself. This isn't your hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant. It's a fun, whimsical place with interesting art throughout, and a unique variety of food to match. We both had mojitos and the chile relleno (at friends' recommendation) and were completely blown away with the flavor and amount of care that went into the presentation. A big thumbs up for a night out with friends or even after a softball game as my coworkers have done plenty of times! I have been coming to Cactus for a few years now and I am always satisfied.I always start off with the house salsa &amp; guacamole and chips! The salsa is so delicious with great lime flavor. I sometimes order the lemonade with jalape&#241;o. Its very refreshing but I wish they would put more drink in the cup rather than ice. I have tried many of their dishes but my favorites are: The Mexican chop salad which has a great lime dressing and tender chicken.Chicken tacos are pretty fantastic with good fixins! My favorite I've had so far is probably the chicken chimayo. The blue-corn tortillas and green chile sauce mixed with the melted cheese was fantastic!I've also had the fry bread with honey which is pretty good. The honey and warm fry bread combo is awesome.Keep in mind this isn't Mexican. It's a Mexican/Southwest fusion so many of the dishes are not "traditional." I love Cactus. &#160;Their chips and salsa always hit the spot and I think they've got one of the best flans around. &#160;Their sangria is light and refreshing and I've tried a new dish every time I've come, and I've enjoyed each one of them thoroughly. &#160;The atmosphere is great and the decor is colorful and fun. &#160;The service has always been superb, and they let you sit and chat for a while &#160;- so you never feel like you're being rushed out of there. This is always a great option if you have a hankering for some Tex Mex. Delicioso! &#160;Cactus has a slightly different edge than the other run of the mill Mexican restaurants. &#160;Their focus is Southwest cuisine. &#160;We had a couple of popular items from the menu, although, we did see other items than sounded like they would be tasty too.1) &#160;Appetizer of Guacamole2) &#160;Appetizer of the Squash Blossoms stuffed with goat's cheese3) &#160;Sonora Spa Chicken4) &#160;Butternut Squash Enchilada5) &#160;Kid's Quesadilla with a side of grilled steak6) &#160;FlanSo let me start,,,,the salsa that they serve at the table is addictive. We loved it but were scared that we were going to get full off of eating so many of their tortilla chips. &#160;The chips were light and not greasy.Next, the guacamole looked nice. &#160;Large portion garnished nicely. &#160;However, I wasn't a big fan of this. &#160;They dilluted the avocado with something that made it less than if I would have received a smaller portion with just plain o'l avocado.I got my ice tea which was wonderful since it was the Paradise Brand...Passion Fruit. &#160;I haven't had this since the 90's, but I love it and it brought back old memories.Then, we got our squash blossoms with goat cheese. &#160;The closest similarity that came to mind was like crab rangoon, fried with creamy cheese and served over 3 different types of sauces....chipotle, a cilantro-garlic (?), and some smokey sauce. &#160;All three sauces were fine as well as the squash blossoms. &#160;The problem was that they just served 3 for that price. &#160;You could eat a whole plate/basket of these easily. &#160;It would be like serving 3 corn chips with a guacamole smear. &#160;My Sonora Spa Chicken was pretty tasty. &#160;I liked the grilled chicken along with all of the vegetables. &#160;The presentation wasn't my favorite. &#160;It tasted better than it looked.My wife's butternut squash enchilada plate was huge. &#160;It came with black beans, rice and a massive enchilada-thing. &#160;I'm usually a big, big, big fan of any type of bean. &#160;These black beans were just so-so. &#160;The rice was good mainly because they added pepitas (toasted squash seeds) which gave it a nice bite/crunch. &#160;The enchilada itself had a very hearty tasty filling of some squash and a massive portabella mushroom inside. &#160;Once again, the flavor far exceeded the presentation. &#160;From the looks, it was boring. &#160;The taste, though, was ...mejor !The kids Quesadilla was just a quesadilla. &#160;The grilled steak was some small pieces of steak meat. &#160;My daughter munched on the steak meat and polished this off.For dessert, we split a flan. &#160;Our server said that it is made with 3 types of milk giving it a thick creamy finish. &#160;Jason, our server, was right. &#160;It was delicious but tasted like it was dense in calories. &#160;Not sure, but we liked it a lot.In terms of look and feel of the restaurant, it is kind of noisy, but my daughter liked the tiger fabric used on the booth seats. &#160;The lighting was a little low. &#160;They had a kid's menu, but it felt a little bar-like. &#160;Great if you like getting alcoholic beverages and still have kids, but it didn't feel as family-like.The food overall was pretty tasty, a little pricey, and presentation could be a little better to really emphasize the quality of the meal. +1 point for decor+1 point for well cooked steak fajitas+1 point for good salsa and okay guacamole-1 point for crappy, lackluster service-1 point for no sopapillas for dessertEnded up here during restaurant week by accident. &#160;The place was understaffed for the busy Sunday afternoon crowd (1-2pm). &#160;Hostess was on the phone when we walked in (which happens) but still failed to acknowledge us until she was done (should not happen).Took a seat in the bar. &#160;Admired the decorations. &#160;Chit-chatted. &#160;Checked our phone. &#160;Started at each other. &#160;Finally had to ask the bartender for menus because we had waited 5-10 minutes and no one came by our table.Bartender came over and mumbled something about specials available for restaurant week. &#160;We ordered our drinks and food. &#160;Ice tea came without lemon (not a hard garnish, right?) and no offer for sweetener (it's not rocket science - at least offer it). &#160;Free chips and salsa and not-free guacamole came out, later fajitas came out. &#160;Steak was well cooked. &#160;One order of fajitas was plenty for two people. &#160;Burned through the tortillas quickly (why do restaurants only serve you three tortillas? &#160;People always want more). &#160;Had to get someone else to bring us tortillas. &#160;Paid, left.With all that said, I would go back. &#160;The Yelp review say that Cactus is usually pretty good. &#160;I could tell they were slammed, and for the most part the staff was busting their butts to get to all the tables. &#160;They had a decent selection of vegetarian options that included vegetables (as opposed to just cheese enchiladas). &#160;The service today was just. so. missing. I ordered a Margarita with Grand Marnier and a Cinnamon-sugar salt rim. It was a very unique cocktail and very tasty!I ordered something on the specials menu. I forget what it was called but it had eggs, cornmeal and steak with potatoes on the side and it was delicious. I'm normally not rude at the table, but if my girlfriend would have asked for a bite, I would have said "No!"A manager brought us some complimentary flan because it was our first time. The flan was very good and we were impressed that he brought it.We'll definitely come back. The (formerly) $10 Nachos are the best you will EVER have on the planet. Split between two people with a mojito or two each is the perfect Friday after work.Add the meat to the nachos, so good! My husband and I went here for my birthday dinner. The staff were great, especially our waitress, Cynara, who was very friendly and attentive without hovering like a seagull. The food was very good, but don't go expecting your typical Mexican/American food. There is a big emphasis on cumin, which I am not a huge fan of, but the food was done well, and I still enjoyed it. The Hibiscus Chi Chi is to DIE for if you are a Girl Drink Drunk such as myself, and the Bananas Dulce was so good I wanted to take it home to meet my parents. This is a great place for a classy but casual evening and the prices are decent. Love Love Love Cactus! Went for the first time on Saturday and enjoyed dinner on the patio. Our food took a little longer than I would have liked but was enjoying the sun (WTF is that?), a mojito, the delicious salsa, and amazing dinner company.Sampled both the chicken tacos and the chicken chimichanga. Both were delicious! I can't wait to go back and try the butternut squash enchiladas. :)After we finished the manager came out and welcomed us with a complimentary flan. Can't beat that!! Food is good. Chips and Salsa plus Guacamole cost $6, instead of free in other Mexican restaurant. &#160;They also don't refill the chips. &#160;We had Fajita (beef) and Green enchilada, both are well made and tasted fresh. &#160;The Cactus Margarita came in a simple glass, a bit on the sweet side and too much salt on the rim.Overall atmosphere relaxing and nice. &#160;It is hard to feel real Mexican in Seattle. &#160;On this sunny Sunday lunch, it gets pretty close here.It is a bit far to drive and parking is street only. &#160;Service was a bit slow, but not unbearable. My experience here was decent. &#160;I came with a friend for lunch on a weekday. &#160;Being from Texas, I search out places in Seattle that offer Tex-Mex cuisine. &#160;Honestly, this place isn't it. &#160;The service was excellent. &#160;The food itself was passable, but unremarkable. &#160;I would liken it to something you'd find in Arizona more than Texas for New Mexico. &#160;Again, it wasn't bad, just unremarkable. &#160;It was fairly bland, and while everything tasted fairly fresh, it lacked any zing to speak of. &#160;If you're looking for low-key Mexican food, this isn't a bad place. Went here for the first time today, the staff was fantastic. &#160;I work in food service and it's difficult for me to muster up enthusiasm, but these people seems genuinely excited about the food and their roles as hosts. &#160;got the most delicious chimichanga. &#160;guacamole was great, they made our first time experience well worth it. The brisket tacos are amazing! &#160;I tried the seafood enchilada my wife had, it was so good I finished it for her. &#160;Definitely going back. I cannot say enough good things about this place. Cactus has become my must-go-at-least-once spot everytime I find myself in Seattle. &#160;The food is impressive, but the service makes this place THE place to eat in a city full of great dining. If it's nice outside, wait for an outdoor table! Nothing beats just hanging out enjoying the food and watching the Madison Park craziness.Not sure when I'll be back in Seattle, but I know where I'll be headed first! Stellar experience. The salsa was really good, the jalapeno poppers, spicy as hell &amp; so good.Our server was super nice, as well as the manager, and they gave us free dessert for no reason other than we'd never been here before. &amp; let me tell you, that free flan was pretty fucking good.They seem to have their customer service down pat. &amp; I feel I should mention that even though it was a busy Friday night, the bartenders were great, friendly, &amp; fast while we waited at the bar for a table. I came here with my Mom not too long ago and really enjoyed it. I had an awesome waiter and the food was service was pretty quick. As far as food is concerned, it was really good for a Mexican joint. And that's a lot coming from me, &#160;considering I've gotten food poisoning twice in my life from Mexican food. Definitely recommend this place for anyone who finds themselves in Madison Park. Awesome restaurant. Great food, great drinks, good vibe in a good location in Madison Park. I have high standards for tex-mex after living in Austin, Texas for 3 years - this place was among the best since I left Texas.Service is also impeccable: our food took quite a bit of time to arrive since we got there in a bad time when many new folks had just seated. Without us saying a word, the manager came to our table to apologize and gave us a desert to take home. That's what I call good service, we'll be back. My God...this place can do NO wrong. &#160;My boyfriend and I went down to celebrate out anniversary because it is our favorite place to go..and again, it was amazing. &#160;I had the Chile Relleno with coconut rice, which I could eat everyday. &#160;I don't know what in the world they put in that thing, but is is one of the best meals I have ever had. &#160;Not to mention the chips and salsa they start you out with..they are always wonderful. Really the best I have ever had. My boyfriend had the Chicken fried chicken..which was also phenomenal. &#160;The service, as always..great. &#160;We love this place and will remain loyal customers forever! This place is fantastic! &#160;It was our first visit, and the staff was friendly and welcoming. &#160;They were very informative and helpful with questions about the menu. &#160; Everything from the salsa and chips to the desert were fantastic! &#160;I could not get enough. &#160;I left stuffed, but still wanting to eat more of their food. &#160;Delicious! &#160;Their margaritas are good... perfect for a hot day. &#160;I will be going back soon. :) My then-boyfriend worked here for a summer and he'd rave about the food (and occasionally bring some home to entice me) so I finally broke down and went to visit him. So glad I did! The food here is delightful. The guacamole, the fry bread, the steak salad and especially - especially! - the butternut squash enchilada. Everything I've tried, I loved. The cocktails are inspired and tasty as well.Unfortunately I haven't been here since then-boyfriend left and we stopped getting sweet hook-ups but with the new happy hour, I might just return! I came here with friends for a light dinner. &#160;First mistake was thinking that Tex-Mex would somehow pass off as light food. &#160;But, that didn't matter. &#160;I ordered a Pineapple Margarita which was delicious. &#160;For dinner, I ordered the chicken chimichanga. &#160;The chimichanga was packed with chicken, slathered in jack cheese. &#160;The chicken wasn't at all greasy, which was great. &#160;It came with black beans, rice, guacamole and sour cream. &#160;The chicken itself was moist and cooked well. &#160;Overall, I wouldn't say it was anything extraordinary, but they definitely did execute the dish just fine. &#160;The portion of the dish was perfect with relation to how much you pay (a little under $15 for my plate of food).The atmosphere was nice. &#160;We chose to sit outside. &#160;The table wasn't that huge, but for the size of the plates and glasses everything fit just fine. &#160;The service was fine and our waiter was very pleasant.If you're in the Madison Park area and are looking to try out other restaurants along the East Madison Street strip, this place would be worthy of your money. I LOVE CACTUS! Madison Park is my Favorite one! This is the second time Im raving about this place. Im never disappionted and the service is always above and beyond. I sat at the bar with a girfriend and even though the bartendar was slammed we never felt neglected! He was fantastic! The boss man also stepped in when it was especially chaotic! Great Place!! Host/ess: 3.0Wait person: 3.3Food; Taste, Presentation: 3.0Property: &#160;Ambiance, Style, Decor: 3.0 Cactus has become part of the regular rotation for dinner out.Why?Cactus Margaritas with saltThe best damn chips and salsa in townTortilla Soup that I will scarf down in the middle of summer when it's 100 degrees outA steak salad that &#160;made me like salads. &#160;Mixed greens tossed with seared skirt steak, sliced avocado, blue cheese, pico de gallo and other yumminess. &#160;A flan that puts other custard desserts to shame.All that deliciousness served by an attentive and friendly staff.Pity that the nice weather makes for a 30+ min wait, but there are plenty of places nearby to walk to / drink in while you wait. Well, *they* remodeled and I re-ordered. See what a bitch I really am for my prior review.Now, while I miss the charm of the old bar. I don't get fucking hit time and again with crammed two tops. XO to CactusGo for the steak or chicken salads people. A+ When I first visited Seattle, before I moved here, my friends took me to Cactus. Being from Southern California I am very familiar with Mexican/Tex-Mex food but Cactus raises the bar on creativity and adding new flair to tex-mex. This visit I had Seafood enchiladas and man they were good! Nice flavor perfectly cooked, the black beans and rice were made well also. I also order the Sangria, very tasty. My Mom had the special blackened chicken tamales and they were phenomenal! Great spice and flavor and was laid in a lake of a sweet corn relish sauce, really good also. To cap the meal off we ordered two orders of churros, with dipping sauces of a mexican carmel, a dark chocolate sauce (reminiscent of Bosco,) and a coconut whipped cream, which was absolutely amazing! Just a great meal every time. I like Cactus. &#160;I came with a friend and we sat outside which was great for people watching on a nice summer evening. I liked the feel of the inside too. &#160;It is good for louder groups or a casual date (esp if you sit outside). &#160;I ordered a veggie enchilada that no longer appears to be on the menu, but it was good.I really wanted to try the cocktails and desserts and other dishes such as the seafood enchilada, butternut squash enchilada, cuban flan and bananas dulce. &#160;I am really excited for the Lake Union location to open especially since they will have happy hour there. &#160;Either way, I will be back to one of these two locations! The chop salad really hit it out of the park for me, will be back.One of the best uses of that southwestern flavor I have enjoyed in some time. I can really only root for the food here. I've been to the seattle location twice and once in kirkland. They have an interesting drink menu too.The service is horrible (atleast at the seattle location). Went on a Wednesday night and it was busy (WTF?) As soon as we step in, there's one person waiting at the door and the hostess(es?) are no where to be found. One person who i believe to be a hostess walks right by with out a "hello" or a "i'll be right w/ you". I only see one table in the bar area and don't want to miss out on it because another couple has already walked in behind us and we're all considereing how long of a wait it will be for a table. (this place isn't worth the wait)We're finally told we can grab the last empty table and wait... and wait.... for someone to bring menu, water, etc.Eventually all of our dining needs are met, but i feel this took twice as long as it should have. It's not like they were understaffed. I often saw staff standing by those order registers talked to eachother instead of helping.oh well. one less reason to go to Madison area restaurants. I live very close to this marvelous establishment which allows me to frequent it often. Awesome margaritas, wonderful chips and guacamole, and hearty, innovative and inspired spanish dishes keep most everyone in Madison Park coming back so often, it is often very difficult to get a table!!!Great place to eat, drink an be merry. The food here is amazing, and the veggie burrito that they have on the lunch menu is also order-able for dinner, and it's FANTASTIC. And really quite beautiful, actually. Like you feel a bit mean for ruining the presentation.The service, however, is sometimes inconsistent. Sometimes phenomenal, sometimes less than stellar, but with potential.One time, we came here and ordered two vegetarian items, but received a chicken and a prawn instead. After we noted the mistake, our meal was complementary, as were drinks, copious amounts of guac and dessert. Yay!On Mother's Day, we went there for dinner around 6, expecting the usual wait. The girl curtly said it would be an hour for a party of five. Accepting this, we walked around, and then came back to wait for about 20 minutes. To our disgust, there were open booths, tables and tables that could be slid together to accommodate us everywhere. There were four booths open.So we waited... the full hour. Then our buzzer rang and we sat at the booths we had been waiting for, and watching. The same booths that remained empty the whole time were were there. And when we left. Bummer. Apparently though, you can call ahead to get your name on the list to lessen your wait.Tasty food, try the nachos for an appetizer because who doesn't adore a big plop of guac around some tasty covered chips? Cute, expensive, small place. The food is pretty good but be prepared to wait a long while for a table and there are so few and this is a popular joint. The service is top notch, however. There was some kind of chipotle brownie dessert that we had and it was sinful. Very good. I'll probably be back if I can find parking and don't have to wait an hour for a table. Cactus has many items on its menu that I would say are the best in their category in the city. &#160;They have the best mojitos (all the flavors are good, pomegranate and mango are my favorite, but you'll be missing out if you don't try the coconut at least once), the best tamales (go early though, tamales are usually one of the specials and they run out quickly), the best salad (their Mexican Chop Salad), etc. &#160;Of all these bests, the best of the best are their chorizo nachos. It's hard to mess up nachos so there are plenty of places to get decent or even good ones. &#160;In fact even the fast food world offers some pretty good nachos. &#160;However, if you want the best you'll go to Cactus and order the chorizo. &#160;I can't put my finger on what exactly makes these nachos superior. &#160;Maybe it's the sauce. &#160;Instead of sour cream they put buttermilk crema on their nachos and it is delicious. &#160;It could also be the chorizo. &#160;I've had chorizo nachos other places and they haven't been as good, but Cactus makes their own chorizo so that may give them an edge. &#160;Whether it's the sauce or the chorizo or some combination of other factors, I can assure you these are the best nachos you will ever taste. &#160;You'll need at least 2-3 people to finish a full order of them but luckily they also offer half orders. I can honestly say i've never been disappointed with Cactus EVER and i've been hundreds of times. I used to frequent the Kirkland one when i lived there. I was pleasantly surprised when I moved to Madison Park to find another down there as well! It's definitely one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. It's more Tex mex than anything - not that greasy drowned in cheese type mexican food. This place serves fresh, delicious and interesting plates. Butternut Squash Enchilada.. never even thought of putting those together but it's to die for! So delicious! The green enchilada is one of my personal favorites, along with their steak tacos. They always cook their steak to perfection, never dry or over done and the meal comes with all the toppings your appetite desires to make up your own tacos. The Prickley Pear Margarita is a MUST, along with their Guacamole, it ranks top 3 in best Guac i've ever had! The decor is funky and cool. Zebra striped booths, light up lanterns hanging from the ceilings. It's a great spot for HH, a date or just some drinks with free chips and salsa! Doesn't get much better than Cactus!! I was here on 5-26-11.Me &amp; all of my co-workers in my unit came here to celebrate one of colleagues retirement. My boss chose this picked this place because he had been here before, but no one else knew what to expect because this was our first time here.The first thing you notice when you walk inside is how beautiful this place is! I love the decorations, etc &amp; felt completely comfortable from the minute I walked in. FYI when you walk in the bar is to your right, &amp; the restrooms are staight ahead.Anyhow, we were seated with the rest of our party immediately, &amp; we started to order drinks as soon as all of our party had arrived. I had a Long Island Iced Tea, which was very good &amp; strong. All pluses! They are very attentive to what their customer wants, etc. I never felt a feeling of "where's the waiter?", "where's my food?" etc. Next we were served chips &amp; salsa. Yummy.They took their time ordering our entrees for us, &amp; we received them with no issues. My food (the butternut squash) was not very good to me however. It's a vegan version of enchiladas, &amp; was too spicy IMO. One of my co-workers who had ordered the same thing, didn't like her meal either, &amp; she had ordered the same thing as me.The place is kept clean. The size is about a medium sized restaraunt. Despite not having the best meal, I'd still give the place a second shot. I highly recommend the green enchilada. &#160;This is the best item on their menu. The staff is always nice, even when they are super busy (which is always).Cactus is a Madison Park institution - and for good reason. The best mexican food AND service we've had in a very long time. The waitress was excellent! The decorations are gaudi like many Mexican restaurants, but very endearing and actually added to the experience. The waitress asked if it was our first time and was thereafter extremely helpful and forthcoming with suggestions. My husband got the Ancho Roasted Pork Pibil and I got the butternut squash Enchiladas - both were AMAZING! Not to mention the watermelon and cucumber margarita and their signature award wining margarita - delicious and refreshing- everything high quality. Then, to make things even better, the manager brought out a surprise flan and thanked us for coming to his restaurant. It was very, very nice - a very personal experience. We will be back many more times. I was totally, completely impressed. WONDERFUL food and excellent drinks. But really, the dealmaker was the service. Our server was the best I can remember in a long time...maybe ever. He was not over the top or false...just really excellent. He actually treated waitering like the art it can be. We felt welcomed and will definitely be back.
Waitstaff runs the gamut from perky to diffident and rude. Decent -not outstanding- food. Douchebaggy clientele. There are so many wonderful meals to be had in Seattle there's just no reason to risk the horrifying failures (bad food, bad service, screaming drunks, &#160;&amp;c) likely to occur during a visit to Peso's.Two stars for an endless parade of laughable wankers &amp; tarts. Yet another awesome visit to Peso's Mexican Kitchen and Lounge. My friends and I often look for that perfect place to meet up Sunday Morning (afternoon) for a bite after a crazy weekend of get togethers and mayhem. Peso's has been the place of choice on several occasions. The staff is super sweet and quite attentive. Though they don't do split checks, they're willing to run cards, make change and get it done. This time I went for the Carne Asada &amp; Eggs. It comes with a salsa fresca and O'Brien style potatoes. The steak is so well marinated and tender that I don't want steak and eggs any other way, ever again! The flavor coming from this piece of meat was amazing, citrus, sweet, savory all in one. My friend Christine got the classic breakfast sandwich served on white toast with avocado, egg, bacon, butter lettuce and tomato which she couldn't shut up about. And she ordered a side pancake. All of it looked amazing. Brett got the ham and cheese scramble, which you'd think would be a standard plate, but you would be wrong. This thing is stuffed with good chunks of ham and swirled with melting Gruyere goodness. Coffee all around and complimentary chips and salsa and our day was set. Get to lower Queen Anne and fight for a parking spot, then sit your rear at Peso's and enjoy! I took Pino, the famous glassblower, and a few of his friends to eat here. When I saw the building from the outside I was a bit nervous, not classy at all. But the food was so delicious! We were all eating off of each others plates and couldn't get enough. What other Mexican restaurant has lobster enchiladas. LOVE! Le sigh. &#160;i love pesos so much. &#160;Everyone that goes there and works there is hot. Anything with tuna there is soooo delicious. &#160;i love to get the tuna from the happy hour menu and/or the fish tacos. &#160;they are both like the best! &#160;mojitos and chips and salsa...drool....but the real reason i am reviewing pesos right now is because i thought everyone should know that the last two times i've been there the waitresses &#160;and &#160;hostesses have been real nice, friendly, and polite! &#160;I almost thought i was some where else! &#160;I had to check and make sure I was still a girl and didn't turn into a guy and that's why they were being so friendly too me. &#160;but it turns out that although i had all my womanly parts they were still soooo nice to me! &#160;this makes me truly happy! &#160;Even though i went and would still go to Pesos if the waitresses were/are mean, it's nice to know that they seem to have gotten an attitude adjustment and i don't have to bring a guy with me to get service. Well while the atmosphere is hip and the staff is pretty to look at... the service and the food left much to be desired.We waited and waited to be seated, and eventually seated ourselves. &#160;Our waitress was cute and bubbly but the food was mushy and bland. &#160;In the end, I think this is the sort of place where you have to be drinking to enjoy the meal. My friends have no idea why I love Peso's and yet it remains true. &#160;I just found out recently it is where ex-Greeks and regular Greeks come to ogle each other but I come here to eat good Mexican food in dimly lit quarters.Supposedly it is known for mingling and having drinks but I really see Peso's as a restaurant that serves food until late. &#160;Everything I've eaten here has been delicious: tuna tartare, chicken tortilla soup with avocado, a lovely grilled shrimp salad with mache greens, steak tacos and those addictively thin tortilla chips served with fresh salsa. &#160;The sangria here is divine.I love the wrought iron decorations and flickering candles. &#160;I've never come here with a date and wouldn't. &#160;It's more for dinner with a girlfriend to people watch. &#160;Service has been lacking at times as the waitresses like to wear backless tops and pretend they are cooler than you. &#160;Besides that though, I love Peso's for a sit-down Mexican meal in the evening. I loved this place! I loved that it was right down the street from our hotel. I loved the decor, very old Mexico style. I loved my Bloody Mary (x2). One of the best I've had in a while. I loved the guacamole and chips they had. I loved the beef fajitas.I loved the service. Why only 4 stars?I didn't love the tortillas. As cute and small as they were, they just weren't that tasty, especially for homemade. They tasted reheated.I didn't really love the rice and beans. My tribe headed into wandered in hungry. It was very busy, first hostess very friendly, the second looked a lil warn out. Our server was good, bus boys kept the waters full.. We where seated right away on a busy Sunday morning. We ordered the Crab &amp; Asparagus Omelet, Chicken Enchiladas, a side of Carne Asada and Crab Enchiladas.... There is no skimping on the portions, they where very generous. Kids say they wanna go back. Really fun place to go, it usually has a great crowd, plus decent food and drinks!Recently, I went here to meet up with some non-lazy people that had just ran in the Weinhard's 4 mile run. I skipped that exercise stuff, I just came for the beer and food! Smart, right?! It was REALLY packed for St. Patrick's day-ish and because of the nearby run, we had to put our names down and wait about 40 minutes to get a table. Service was spotty at best, with drink orders taking about 25-30 minutes for a beer... but in their defense, they were CRAZY busy and they did their best to accomodate everyone. I had the BLT with fries and it was good enough - it's definitely a place to go for the people and vibe, not the food. The music was REALLY loud the last time I went here, so we couldn't talk much but it was still a lot of fun.I like this place!If you're craving awesome greasy food, you'd be MUCH better off at Mecca Cafe across the street. Meh. &#160;I have been here twice in the past month and I am angry at myself for it. &#160;Believe me when I say that I would only come here if dragged in or for some other mighty worthy reason like guaranteed boom-boom time or something. &#160;Then again, the kind of people who seem to frequent Peso's aren't exactly my cup of tea. &#160;On a Wednesday, the place was blasting some 90's hip hop/rap stuff that had all the drunken girls screaming like idiots. &#160;I sound like an a-hole but you know? &#160;I kinda must be because this place holds no interest for me. &#160;If you want to see some hottie waitresses (females), I think this is a good place to go. &#160;The bartenders (men) weren't really noteworthy for me.Oh and my friend &amp; I split a carafe of sangria and she raged all evening about how there wasn't much alcohol in it, it seemed to her. &#160;She was quite displeased. &#160;I wanted to add that because I had to listen to it all evening. &#160;And now you have to read it. &#160;So there. &#160;Peso's, I'd say we could be friends but your douchebag friends annoy me. &#160;It just isn't in the cards. My roommate ran in the Seattle half marathon and a group of us went here for breakfast after. &#160;Getting a table for 6 on a Sunday morning was quite the production - it didn't help that half the people who did the marathon seemingly ran straight to Pesos when they crossed the finish line - but we managed it. &#160;I had the garden scramble, which was one of the daily specials and involved asparagus, mushrooms and pepperjack cheese with a side of breakfast potatoes. &#160;I was hungry and my food disappeared so fast it was hard to believe I'd ever had it in front of me but damn if that wasn't a good meal. &#160;Total for the scramble + coffee was somewhere around $11, which seemed low to me. &#160;I know I've enjoyed my food if I think it should cost more! strong drinks, great decorBlackened Ahi is sublimeBest spot in Queen Anne I love this place for the breakfast happy hour. You heard me! Eat and drink in the MORNING for a low low price! Great eggs, even better mimosas! &#160;Yum yum yum! Pesos, you deserve to have a better rating but there is some small part of me that feels like this is the live version of Match.Com and rather than being winked at via email you're getting winked at and groped at by people in mass. Not that that's a bad thing but it's overwhelming.Daytime:Lunchtime is good here, a nice solid crowd. Happy Hour brings in a lively bunch into the bar and the wait is not out of control. The food is decent but not super stellar. Split a quesadilla with a friend, they're large enough and filling. I shared a White Gulf Prawn quesadilla, savory.Late Night Dining:Packed, normally being in a crowded bar is nothing new and you deal with it and eat something or order some drinks. The crowd is a little on the pretentious side and I feel like I need to put on shiny/glossy eyebrow liner to fit in. The drinks are watered down and expensive. The Cucumber Sage mojito is a nice cocktail to sip away at. Service is harsh, or atleast getting to the bar is not the easiest unless you're lucky to have gotten a seat there or in the back and have a server.This is a more end the night kind of place. Okay but not my favorite. I wandered in here looking for a good breakfast place while waiting for my daughter's ballet class. I was in for a wonderful surprise!I had a veggie omelet with their house-made pico de gallo. &#160;It wasn't just good, it was fantastic! The coffee was strong just like I like it. The waitress was attentive but not annoying. The atmosphere is definitely Seattle. I noticed people of different ages from older posh-looking couples to young goth-looking groups. Ambiance was amazing.I strongly recommend this place for brunch. Parking is street only unless they have a lot hidden somewhere I don't know about. I will be eating here again without a doubt! Breakfast, lunch, dinner or drinks, Peso's is good to go.Try the hueavos rancheros or habanero sausage migas for breakfast over a spicy El Diablo bloody mary along with the rest of the neighborhood. It's packed for breakfast but well worth the wait. If you're nice they'll substitute chorizo in your Migas (highly recomended). &#160;Lunch can be the easiest to get into and the Rockfish tacos and a margarita will hit the spot. Dinner is the time to party with this cantina busting at the seams and shrimp is what you order. Peso's prepares shrimp and a dozen or more ways that's sure to fill you up. Eat late or just come in for a margarita, you're sure to have a good time at the bar.Although I enjoy this south of the boarder tequila shack for any meal, I think waking up to their breakfast is my favorite. it's quiet and local that time of day. Okay, the food definitely makes up for the poor service here. I've only come here for breakfast but OH MY GOODNESS, their eggs benedicts are to die for. I've had the dungeness crab and avocado (heavenly), and the roma tomatoes and avocado (also heavenly). Beware, because any other eggs benedict will never compare to Peso's. The only thing I do not like about this place are the waitresses. Both times I've come, I've received poor service. Apparently they don't like to split checks. And go to brunch after 11:30, they give you free chips and salsa. :) I'm planning on coming here on a weekday for breakfast for their amazing happy hour (a regular $14 meal is reduced to $9? I'll be there.) This is perhaps one of the best breakfast deals in Seattle I've ever seen. The only catch is that it only happens M-F 9am-11am. &#160;90% of the items on the menu is only $6. The others are $9. I went for the crab omelet ($9) that was completely packed with crab. The hollandaise sauce made up for the eggs being way overdone (if I was to throw it on the floor, it would probably bounce back at me). The potatoes looked more like scraps that were thrown on at the last minute but they tasted alright...I suppose. Since everything was so cheap, I decided to share a plate of stuffed French toast with a friend of mine. 2 thick slices of toast stuffed with a cream cheese cr&#232;me fraise, topped with maple butter and a strawberry reduction drizzled on top. It was good but I was eventually turned off by how much cheese I was eating...Nonetheless, the deals here are great and definitely worth checking out. There are many free 2 hr parking spots &#160;1-2 blocks away from the restaurant (off of Mercer) so don't bother feeding the meter. On a cold and rainy Saturday night met up with a friend I seen in like a year, it was pretty packed when I got there and the good looking the people were out in force, this place is in the Queen Anne district after-all.The service was good but the chips were off and it was a bit on the oily side, my friend and I both had drinks, Mojito and Margarita, which were fine but it took a little on the long side to get the drinks to us. &#160;I ordered the green chicken mole enchilada which was decent but NO beans and rice??? I was starving like marvin and I am a pretty decent size guy, with the slowness of service we just left instead of ordering more food. breakfast? check.happy hour? check.dinner? never been.late night? big mistake. that was partly my fault though for trying to make last call on a saturday night.breakfasts have been yummy but i had a bad stomach ache a couple hours after visiting for HH one monday afternoon. sangria good. mmm.one last note--if you need to drop off the kids at swim practice i highly suggest not doing so in the ladies' room; the long hallway past the restroom door weirded me out so bad that i broke into a sweat and certain body parts cringed. the end. The food is terrific. Unique, flavorful, and nice sized portions. I find myself entranced by the decor in the dining room. However, I did NOT find Peso's, a quiet, romantic place for dinner (on the weekends at least): loud music filters in from the adjoining bar, which has the feel of a "meat market" nightclub. Many of the tables in the dining room are pushed SO close together that I couldn't help but overhear other conversations that I just really didn't want to hear.The food, however, more than makes up for any shortcomings! If the food wasn't so amazing, this place would be one-star-worhty.If you are a normal person and don't let frat brothers bother you, then you'll be fine here. I am just a 30+ year old that's out of the single scene.Great food!!! Great food, crappy service.I've eaten here about 4 times and have thoroughly enjoyed all the food I've tried. &#160;My friends swear that the carne asada is the best in the world! &#160;The carnitas are good, the ahi tacos are fantastic and the mole sauce for the enchiladas is incredible. &#160;The happy hour appetizers are great too, real spicy. The chicken lime soup is the only so-so thing I've had there. This is definitely a cool, lively scene and is decorated great. &#160;I guess hot waitresses = lousy service. &#160;The last 2 times there, we had to go to the bar ourselves for our first drinks and were never asked by the waitresses if we wanted more. &#160;We had to get our bus guy to ask for our check. &#160;Can you say $5 tip on a $75 meal? &#160;A good waitress could make a killing there in tips cuz the food is awesome. Peso used to be a lot better few years ago. Used to be one of my favorite spots for happy hour. Now, the food isn't the same. I hardly go to Peso for mexican food. There a lot better places for that. But time to time I go back hoping the food would taste the way it used to. But what I do love about Peso's is their decor. Just puts me in the mood for margaritas! Quite possibly the tastiest food I have ever had while I was in the Pacific Northwest.Had Carnitas Enchiladas Divorciados and some drinks for the birthday dinner.Service however, was vapid and vacant. Lights were on, but no one's home. She could barely manage to multi-task to save her life and or have any type of expression. It was like being served by Posh Spice. She was jealous that you were eating more than she was.Next time, I am in town I want to try the brunch. I heard it's famous. I'll be hungover so I might not give a shit about the service by then. I live right by Pesos and have been going there for years. Pesos is a fun place all times of day. The best thing is their breakfast Happy Hour M-F 9-11am. Most entries are $6. A great value on good food. Late night it turns into a meat market as the night life scene picks up. Gets a little too crowded usually but always fun. I really enjoyed this place. &#160;The hotel recommended Peso's, and it was just as good as he said. &#160;I went with a small group, and we were seated quickly for a weekend night without a reservation. &#160;The bar area was hopping and there is little differentiation between the bar and the regular seating, which actually worked out. &#160;I saw some kids here, but I don't know that the very young would enjoy the food, as it was delicious and spicy.The four of us shared 3 proteins and 2 veg dishes, and we were very full and happy with the choices. &#160;We also shared a small pitcher of sangria, and it was one of the better versions I've had, a little spritzy, but I like that. &#160;The only downside, if there is one, is the bathrooms are oddly sized, and there is a lack of an area to sit and wait for a table, but as long as it's not raining or snowing outside, that isn't too big of a deal. &#160;I would go again. I wanted to try some place new for lunch the other day and when I was looking at the list of places to go my friend said "I love Peso's" so Peso's it was. Since it was around 11 there wasn't a crowd, which was nice. I am assuming my friends salad was good since all I heard for the next 10 minutes was. "mmmm.... mmmm... that is so mmmmmm" The Fajitas were tasty, the chicken was well seasoned (hot but not my tongue is burning in hell hot) and the steak was amazingly tender. Quick question: Am I the only one that wants more Sour Cream and Guacamole than is EVER provided? Perhaps a tiny scoop is they way the roll in Mexico, but I didn't get to this size by skimping on the Sour Cream! The service was fast and friendly with nice suggestions. I absolutely love the decor! It really does make a big difference. Peso's is hot and cold as far as service. &#160;Sometimes you receive chips and salsa when you sit down, sometimes you have to ask. &#160;The happy hour menu is pretty good as far as price and quality, but you have to pick the right night, which is anybody's guess. &#160;Usually the place is just too darned packed, which is good for the business, but &#160;not good if you want good service. &#160;Its a tough call. &#160;There are better places to have mexican food but their menu is a bit more interesting than tacos and burritos.A seat at the bar is recommended if you are alone (if you can get there early enough to find an empty one). &#160; And if you are a tequila connoisseur, there are many tasty ones to choose.So if you like thick crowds, mexican fair and beer and booze, this place is for you. &#160;They play sports on the wide screen tv but I can't tell you what kind of music they play and I've been here a dozen times. &#160;I hear good things about their breakfasts so I shall give that I try.De Nada. Went here last night for a quick meal. &#160;As usual this place was packed, but we were seated immediately. &#160;The server brought out warm tortilla chips and salsa. &#160;This is a simple starter but the salsa was awesome...a bit spicy and garlicky(I love) and very fresh, was a perfect way to start the meal. &#160;We ordered drinks, a mojito for her and a dos equis for me to get ready for some good Mexican food.We both ordered taco platters, spicy mahi mahi for me and seared ahi tuna for her. &#160;The ahi ahi was delicious, fresh and buried under a mountain of fresh ingredients such as salsa, cilantro, avocado etc. &#160;You get three tacos per platter, and believe me when I say the filling is way too big for the relatively small tortilla they come on.All in all a good quick meal, consistent quality as I've been here a few times before. &#160;Though Pesos has a reputation for being a place to go have drinks(or after 8), the food here is definitely good and worth going to for. I love this place, but only during their happy hours lucky there are three of them (breakfast 8-10, afternoon 4-6, late night 10-12). The crab dip is phenomenal-more crab than cheese, and the steak quesadilla comes with an au-jus dipping sauce-delish! Drinks are a little expensive and are never discounted for happy hour--too bad this would have given them five stars! As a fan of spice in the A.M, I loved this place. &#160;I have been before in the summer time and it was a great experience then. &#160;With &#160;the large windows open and a fresh breeze coming in. &#160;This time was just as great. &#160;Their Bloody Mary's are one of the best I've ever had. &#160;The crab omelet is very much tasty. &#160;Fresh crab, and it is a very generous amount. &#160;Not saturated with sauce or alot of egg. &#160;Yummy! &#160; Was crowded but very easy to be seated fast. &#160;They have a happy hour that is 9am-11 that is considerably different in price after ll. &#160;Weekends they serve breakfast til 2:45. &#160;I love love this place. &#160;Anytime I go to Seattle, I stay in the QueenAnne district. &#160;You won't be disappointed with Peso's if you are a fan of spice for breakfast. &#160;Great atmosphere with beautiful lighting. &#160;Ginger our waitress was incredibly nice and very on top of service. Decent food, good service in the lounge area but not so much at the bar. Always packed though but on the bright side you can peek through the window and know if there's space. Ambiance is yuppie but good tequila selection. yummmmm.can i just say that i love this place? no matter what i order, i am ALWAYS satisfied.this time i got the salt and pepper prawns which were lightly breaded (very lightly) and had lots of texture and tasted great. the BF got ahi tacos which he loved.the fill is really clean, kind of like sushi and it was the perfect amount of food. definitely one of my favorite places in QA. the only con is that they dont accept reservations. oh well. i guess ill have to live with that. While I've never been a fan of the Phi Beta Idiot/Anglo Guido crowd, I can ignore that for the great happy hour and breakfast. &#160;I've never had a bad meal here. &#160;Enjoy everything on the HH menu and the crab eggs bennie is wonderful. Don't mind the loud music~it drowns out the inane conversation at the surrounding tables so I can focus on the people I came with. Yes you're an unwitting contestant in a reality TV show, but, the food is still good. &#160;Focus on that. &#160;And tip your waiters/waitresses. &#160;Spray tans and Axe body spray don't pay for themselves honey. Found the food to be average and nothing more. The chips for the salsa was oily and had a stale taste to it. My chicken enchilada was ok. It was lacking something.Service wasnt all that great. We found ourselves on the bar side waiting for a while and wondering if there was anyone working before finally seeing the waitress after 10-15 mins. Waitress had an unfriendly vibe to her and it didnt seem like she wanted to be working or something.After hearing about this place and finally coming here, we found ourselves disappointed. Dont think we would give this place a second try. The food here is consistently very good and you can't beat the breakfast happy hour, not to mention the coffee's amazing. &#160;I've never had anything I didn't think was exceptional. &#160;The happy hour specials in the bar aren't spectacular and neither is the sangria but the restaurant more than makes up for it. &#160;Definitely a great place for breakfast on a weekday and even worth a wait on the weekend. This is overpriced, low quality food that's not authentic. &#160;The ambiance, location, and size are okay, but don't make up for the deficiencies in cuisine. Okay, &#160;Ive been coming to this joint since it first opened about 9-10 yrs ago. They started off smaller and much more spare, but the food has always been fabulous, and the drinks on point. I used to work only a few blocks away and had lunch there often, then moved to the neighborhood, and it was basically my "cheers". &#160;They have constantly reinvested money into the place, and everytime Im home and stop by I notice something new. You know, the place is packed from breakfast until 2am closing time, ALL THE TIME!! Great place to grab drinks before a concert at the key. Had a killer breakfast here last weekend, the chicken fried steak is off the hook, plus you cant beat the huevos rancheros or any of the benedicts. And the bloody marys! Only problem is it can be hard to get &#160;a table unless you make friends easily, which I do. You should too! :) My department comes here a few times a year for lunch/breakfast and it's great. The food is delicious. The decor is pretty unique as is the music that plays.I haven't been there during busier times so I'm not sure what it's like then. If it's anything like the mornings, I'm sure it's great. Love the food here! &#160;Maybe I haven't adventured out to other places since I was just a visitor but the two times we dined here we left full and satisfied. &#160;The chicken fried steak and tacos were awesome! &#160;I will definitely be back here again. Had brunch here today - &#160;Hands down - Peso's is the best brunch joint when ur hungover. I'm a big believer in the Chicken Fried Steak w/ Jalapeno cornmeal gravy (seriously so good - spicy too). &#160;The brunch menu is extensive and everything rocks so you won't be disappointed. &#160;They serve Cafe Vita here - which is awesome. They also play cool music &#160;while u brunch and it almost feels like your still partying from the night prior. &#160;People flock here for a reason. &#160;Tip: M-F they have Happy Hour breakfast (All entrees for $6). &#160;Not alot of places serve Chips N Salsa for breakfast &#160;-regulars know that Peso's is GOOD real Good... Met up with a bunch of friedns here the other night. &#160;I can't comment much about the crowd but the food was hit and miss. &#160;I ordered the Chile Rellenos which is one of my go to Mexican dishes when I can't decide what to get. &#160;It wasn't the greatest, kind of runny and the flavors just didn't meld very well for me. The chorizo taco made up for it! &#160; Thank god for yummy spicy pork! &#160;Overall, not a bad experience. &#160;Next time will try their breakfast/brunch which I also hear is pretty good. It's no secret, I looooove breakfast. &#160;We hit up Peso's pretty much on accident, and I'm so glad we did. &#160;I've pretty much avoided this place at night due to rumors of rampant douchebaggery, but MAN! The breakfast here cannot be denied. &#160;And if you can make it here on a weekday between 9-11, plates are only six bucks!On to the deliciousness. The chicken fried steak with corn-jalepeno gravy is absolutely freaking amazing. &#160;I also tasted the carnitas, and red chili enchiladas, which were pretty great as well. The bloody mary's are just so-so, I like mine with lots of garnish, and these are pretty plain. &#160;BUT. You must try the chicken fried steak. Unless you are a vegetarian, and then I'm just so sorry that you will not be able to sample this deliciousness. Come to think of it, I'd eat that gravy on damn near anything. &#160;A garden burger perhaps?Their music selection fits me mighty nice as well, creating the perfect ambiance for my meal? MJ, Jay-Z, &#160;The Roots. And the boyfriend definitely appreciated that the Husky game was playing in the bar.  I will be back for more. Oh yes. The food here is great, dont get me wrong. But I recently made the mistake of going on a saturday night. Apparently there are no hostess', its open seating if you want food. Its overcrowded andyou just stand around and wait until one of the sex and the city wanna-bes leave thier huge booth so you can swipe it and get some food. Would not suggest going on a weekend night. Around 4 and 5 seem to be the best times to go. Also, the staff did not seem friendly any of the times I have gone. Peso's Kitchen is clean and the d&#233;cor is quite good. However they do tend to have a crowding problem which can be hard to deal with on a Friday or Saturday night. If you like rubbing and squeezing by people in a bar, want to pay for semi-expensive drinks, or just hang around ordinary people - then this place is for you. &#160;Otherwise say heck with all that and go in the morning for their fantastic breackfast and Blood Mary. &#160;That's what I do. yum! that's what i thought when i finished stuffing myself with all the food form peso's.wasn't the first choice of the night (earlier spot had a long wait), but peso's was definitely a good choice. been here before for drinks before but that's about it and it was fine. dinner however, was great!chips and salsa were decent. nothing special, but we got the crab dip and it was amazing! worth a try.i ordered the carnitas tacos and there was plenty of food! it came with three tacos, each topped with salsa, some shredded veggies, avocado, this creamy sauce on top of some seasoned beef cooked very tender. only finished two of the tacos, so i guess i should have laid off all the chips and salsa and crab dip.it was perfect dinner for that night, no complaints (save the wait, but hey, it was a friday night, so waits are to be expected). I've been coming here for years, mostly for Happy Hour on a Sunday or Monday and the food is awesome, it's one of the menu's that I never get tired of and they are consistently changing items on the menu as well.....BUT and I say but because the service is super inconsistent, at least as far as the bar goes. At times it's as if the bartenders are on auto-pilot they see a lot of regulars and I'm sure they see plenty of new faces too the problem is there attentiveness is unpredictable. Basically if you don't kiss up to them they ignore you which sucks cause guess what guys, it's your job to look your patrons in the eye, greet them and take their freakin order so don't ignore me, or wait for me to flag you down because lord knows the music is so loud that you'd never hear me yell. They have this sort of attitude like ya?...you talkin' to me? So just know that going to this restaurant can bring some frustration, as for the waitressess they are a hit or miss too, if you find a good one, hold on to her and find out her schedule so that you can be guaranteed good service, I thought that's what we tipped for...am I wrong? My one very huge complaint is the ladies bathroom, man &#160;feel like I should be yelping bathrooms around Seattle cause there's some down right nastiness going on. Lets just say the Health Dept &#160;needs to take a look at the bathrooms in Peso's gross doesn't cover it! Great food. &#160;Good happy hour (but they require a $3 drink minimum). &#160;Kind of an odd atmosphere. &#160;Nice restaurant on the left; bar and loud music on the right. &#160;I'm usually in the bar area so I don't really know how loud the music sounds in the restaurant area. &#160;But overall, it's a good place. &#160;The food makes up for everything. &#160;Everything I've ever had there is delicious. Best breakfast in Seattle. &#160;Maybe the best breafast in WA. &#160;Maybe the best breakfast place anywhere it is so amazing! &#160;My favorite is the chicken fried steak. The brunch is marginal at best-but it's not worth it to endure the hideous service, frat-boy vibe, and insects.The dinner is good-if you enjoy the occasional stint of food poisoning. Sure this place is a meathead meat market most nights; however, their $6 M-F breakfast can't be beat.The chicken fried steak, while non-traditional with its (amazing!!!) jalepeno and corn cream gravy, is outstanding. &#160;Eggs Bene, can't go wrong.So sidestep the nighttime crowds and swing in some workday morning that you've called in sick (or hungover) because Peso's will serve what you're craving. A regular Happy Hours stop for us! &#160;Good food, decent drinks, good service! &#160;Nice atmosphere but rather crowded if you go after 5pm. The food is never a disappointment and is worth the hit-and-miss of the service staff. &#160;Here's a tip for the restaurant: Just because they're pretty, it doesn't mean they know good service! &#160;Oh, and I wouldn't sit at the bar, you might be waiting eons for a drink. I lovvveee chorizo, and I love breakfast, and I love cheap breakfast. All together, Peso's was mindblowingly perfect. The atmosphere is beautiful, the food is well-crafted with an authentic and creative menu and quality ingredients. Probably been to Peso's more than 100 times over the years, many of which were pre-Sonics game dinners (remember them?). &#160;VERY few misses, and still the first place we think of when we want to go out but don't have something specific in mind. &#160;Very high quality, tasty and original Mex and Tex-Mex dishes that are consistent and filling at a very reasonalbe price. &#160;And a recent re-vamping has made the menu even better, like with the steak selections all coming in at &amp;lt;$20. &#160;Definitely a lounge hotspot for the 20-somethings so you can expect it to be loud and boisterous on the obvious nights with a rather un-classy but evidently necessary bouncer at the door checking your grandma's ID. &#160;And many of the young waitresses' charms come with a certain inexperienced-ness regarding service. &#160;But the food, ambiance and value overcomes all.
If you're in Seattle and want some amazing New England Clam Chowder...come here! &#160;This certainly is not the best in the country but it is the best in Seattle! &#160;I always stop by here when I'm in the market to grab a (sourdough) bread bowl with chowder. &#160;The prices are right and the lines are usually right too. &#160;It can get very packed here but people move in and out pretty quickly.Next time I might try some of their other chowders but just can't stop thinking about the clam chowder. &#160;Mmmmmmm I'm a huge fan of clam chowder and was thrilled to find out that Seattle was the place to be when it comes to this heavenly soup. &#160;This place was really hard to find! &#160;It's not in the main area where the main market is --it's actually in an alley way that can easily be missed. &#160;The chowder was so creamy and full of flavorful clams. &#160;It had a good amount of butter and the most perfect potatoes! &#160;I came to this place expecting a huge long line but luckily there was no line at all. &#160;It's a tiny place with about 10 tables or so, along with outside seating. &#160;This place is a definite must stop. &#160;It was really reasonably price for the quality of food. &#160;I would definitely come back! A pigeon flew into the shop while I was eating my chowder. Some daring guy used a tray to shoo him out. S/he left on foot. Apparently, that kind of thing happens all the time at Pike Place Chowder. So does OUTSTANDING Chowder. The other 208 reviews of this place are correct. I can personally attest to the Seafood Chowder. Huge chunks of fish, shrimp, potato, corn, etc. The broth is SO thick and creamy, without being gluey or pastey. How do they do that?Do NOT come to Seattle without trying this chowder. Writing this as a guy that dislikes clam chowder - I'm fan of Pike Place Chowder. &#160;This surprised me too.I got dragged here and it looked like an absolute tourist trap: in the middle of Pike Place and with a sign out front bragging about their 'famous' dungeness crab rolls. &#160;I always am wary of any place claiming a 'famous' item.Grabbed the 'Award Winner' in a bread bowl for about $8. &#160;I figured I would give chowder another shot and figured that this selection should be a good representative for chowder-dom... being a 2006 winner and all.Wow - so hearty and tasty. &#160;If I didn't have it in a bread bowl, I would have gladly licked the bowl clean. &#160;I'm not sure if I just had bad chowder all my life or if this place's chowder is just that much better than chowders I've had.The only bad point is that the bread bowl is sourdough and it seemed a bit stale and overly tangy for the chowder pairing. &#160;Avoid unless you're a huge fan of sourdough or an absolute sucker for bread bowls like I am (in the words of 'Seinfeld' Steinbrenner: "Nothing more satisfying than looking down after lunch and just seeing a table.").Anyways, will be sure to hit up Pike Place Chowder again the next time I'm in Seattle. &#160;They made me a believer in chowder again. I like the chowder here over Ivar's, as well as the atmosphere (grab and go vs a sit down chain restaurant)I ordered the scallop chowder and Yumm-ie. Thick &amp; hearty (and of course heavy). The manhattan clam was tangy and tomato sauce based (with a little bit of kick). I left Seattle satisfied after eating this chowder! Definitely would come again... I'm ruined for life now because I've had Pike Place Chowder! It will be hard for other chowders to live up to my new standards. I got to try three things on my visit, the Seafood Bisque, Seared Scallop Chowder and the Classic Clam Chowder. All of them are fantastic! The Scallop Chowder has a lighter flavor than the classic clam and the delicate flavors are complimented by dill and lemon. The Clam Chowder is amazing, well balanced with huge clams. YUM.This stuff is SO GOOD I bought a gallon, had them pack it on ice and paid the airline to check a second bag just so I could bring some back to Phoenix. Next time I visit Seattle I'm leaving the suitcase at home and packing a cooler. How can you resist a place that has an award for the "Nation's Best Chowder?" &#160;The New England clam chowder is delicious - the perfect cure to a dreary rainy Seattle day. &#160;Nice and creamy with tasty chunks of potato and clams; I love it when chowders actually taste somewhat like the ocean - not just cream! &#160;This was also my first experience trying a Dungeness Crab sandwich, which was a indulgent mouthful of fresh, meaty crab. &#160;SO GOOD. &#160;I got the 1/2 soup and 1/2 sandwich combo for a good price, which lets you enjoy all of the delicious eating options here. &#160; Of course, if you can't decide, opt for the "chowder flight." &#160;The bisque and scallop chowder are also tasty and different versions of the typical chowder.This is a cute, though small, place tucked inside the Post Alley area. &#160;A &#160;delicious retreat from the crowded mobs on the main area of Pike Market. AWARD WINNING!!!! Three titles for their seafood bisque and for their regular chowder!!!! We came here on our tasting tour with Savory Seattles classic Pike Place &#160;Tour and loved it. We brought a friend to try some later on in the week. The flavor and consistency is just right. I cant even imagine how delicious it must be to eat this on a cold rainy day. Ohhhh yeaaaaaLOVED this place. Excellent. This place has ruined my life.I had the best clam chowder (New England) I have ever had and now, every single clam chowder I have had after that is a big fat disappointment. &#160;For goodness sakes, I have LIVED in New England and nothing compares over there.My guess? There has to be crack in the chowder. That has to be it.P.S. My boyfriend had the crab bisque. Oh man, that was awesome too. &#160;I wish we had this place in DC. &#160;Thank goodness I have family in Seattle---excuses for more Pike Place awesomeness. As a Californian, I knew only of Chowders at Pier 39 in San Francisco to have thee best clam chowder. &#160;Not anymore! Sad to say, Pike's chowder basically shitted on Chowders in my opinion.We had their New England Clam Chowder and Seafood Bisque and it was H-E-A-V-E-N! A great complimentary to Seattle's rainy &amp; cold weather that a lot of people find depressing. &#160;It will definitely satisfy your appetite, put a smile on your face, and forget the cold weather. &#160;Their chowder and bisque were full of flavors.Bread bowl is a must! 3 words....Seared Scallop Chowder. You can taste the butter and the dill and all the wonderful chowder goodness. Every time I'm in the Market, I have to get a cup even if it's 80 degrees outside, I don't care.Yes, their other chowders are good too and I haven't had anything but the chowders so I can't comment on the quality of their other menu items. I would rather fill my tummy with chowder! Can't give anything less than 5 stars to Pike Place Chowder for serving up the best clam chowder I've ever had. &#160;The chowder was the perfect way to refuel after the long drive to Seattle. &#160;This eatery was actually recommended to us by a Seattle native, so we knew we were in for something tasty. &#160;I ordered the classic New England clam chowder. &#160;It was creamy, smooth, and chock-full of clams and potatoes. &#160;Each spoonful was a medley of flavors dancing on my taste buds. &#160;Perfection. &#160; Don't be fooled Pike Place Chowder's hidden location. &#160;It's not in the main market place, but secluded in a nearby alley way. &#160;If you can't find it on first glance, don't give up! &#160;If you're visiting Seattle, definitely put this chowder heaven on your itinerary. &#160; Pike Place knows how to do clam chowder right. &#160;Their clam chowder is a divinely delicious masterpiece. &#160;Don't just take my word for it. &#160;Let the 100's of yelpers before me and the multitude of awards speak for this amazing New England clam chowder. This was such a good lunch!We were told we had to go here for the best chowder ever. It's hard to say if it's the best ever, but it's certainly the best I ever had. &#160;The line was around the food shop next door and there were no seats. That tells you something about a place, for sure. &#160;I got the Chowder Sampler, so I could taste a little bit of everything. &#160;Four 5oz servings of chowder for $10.75. The winner, of course, was the standard Pike Place New England Chowder. &#160;Creamy, excellent taste, and good sized clams that aren't rubbery! &#160;The Seared Scallop Chowder was good as well, with an interesting taste of dill and lime juice. &#160;I greatly enjoyed the Seafood Bisque, stuffed with cod, wild salmon, calamari, and bay shrimp. I least liked the Daily Special, which was a broth based soup chock full of bay shrimp and corn. &#160;it was good, but the others were better.Free bread on the side to go with the soup and great atmosphere; there's nothing like a soup server with a Boston accent! Chowdaahh! While the chowda', no matter what flavor you chose, is delicious at PPC-- warning to the unaware: the vegetarian clam chowder is not the thick, creamy, delicious concoction you might imagine when you think of "clam chowder". Being my thoughtless self, I ordered a small portion of it and felt like an idiot when I realized that I didn't want what looked to be a vegetable broth with clams. I didn't refuse, because the guy behind the counter was kinda cute and I didn't want to make an idiot of myself. The vegetarian clam "chowder" was definitely worth the 5-10 minute wait, but it wasn't what I was craving. I did have a spectacular crab sandwich as well. I'm telling you, this is real crab and a lot of it! Yum! You can try both- the chowda' and the crab-witch, all for $12.05, and get a drink to boot! I would definitely return for a quick lunch. Alright, alright...As promised, I went back to try the chowder (as part of the Savor Seattle tour, actually) - and the chowder is pretty darn good. *REALLY* good, in fact. A nice mix of flavors, and I can see why it is award-winning.We also got to try the seafood bisque as part of the tour. And... same outcome as before, unfortunately. I still think it's pretty bland for a bisque. From now on, when I visit, I will stick to the clam chowder. This is a great place to have lunch. &#160;It is a very cute, open concept restaurant. &#160;It is very tiny and seats maybe 10 people? including the outside seating. &#160;The menu is very simple, clam chowder and some sandwiches. &#160;We decided to try the clam chowders only since we already had so much to eat while we were at Pike Market. &#160;The clam chowders came with a piece of sourdough bread and oyster crackers. &#160;They had extra breads on the counter but totally stale so do not even bother reaching for it. &#160;The clam chowders were very good. &#160;Not as thick as the clam chowder at Ivar down at the pier, much more buttery with strong clam aroma. &#160;Honestly, we liked the clam chowder at Ivar better because half way through the bowl, we both felt as though we had enough because of all the butter in the rue. &#160;But it really depends on what you like so you might totally prefer this chowder over Ivar...you just have to try it yourself :)*Food = good, very buttery, not as thick as Ivar chowder*Service = fast, nice*Price = good*Decor = very casual I had the boston clam chowder.............and the seafood bisque.I can't say that its the best that I have had, but it comes close! With sour dough bread..................yummy! Pike Place's thick creamy chowder is the perfect pick-me up after a sleepless day of traveling.It's easy to find. Just look for the long hungry line outside. But don't let the line deter you from trying this seafood wonderland. Though there are a multitude of food options in Pike Place Market - stick to the good stuff and hit up Pike Place Chowder.Make sure you order enough a hefty serving of the clam chowder with sides of soft doughy sour-dough bread. And then....and only then, &#160;splurge on the dungeness crab rolls.The crab rolls are good &#160;- and full of fresh flavorful crab. But in between bites of our rolls, my lunch partner and I realized it was missing something.We both glanced at the hearty cup of clam chowder in front of us and in unison - proceeded to drizzle it all over our crab rolls.Ahhhhh perfection.Experiment with the menu here. All of their seafood items taste fresh. But make sure that whatever you do - you try the chowder. If even just to spruce up the rest of the menu. Thank you Yelp! &#160;This was great food and reasonably priced.Only gave it four stars because it seemed impossible to get a refill on a fountain soda Best seafood bisque. Ever. What else can I say that hasn't been said already? Amazing! Their clam chowder is the BEST. I didn't think it was possible to have clam chowder THIS delicious and so ridiculously good. This place is on Post Alley, in the middle of Pike Place. I sat indoors and listened to musicians on the street. I loved the chowder so much that I came back twice in a row.I wouldn't mind getting the chowder shipped to my home. It is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Best clam chowder in Seattle! I tried Ivar's near the pier and it didn't even come CLOSE. Pike Place Chowder really lived up to its hype. &#160;The England clam chowder is really something special. &#160;Even the potatoes in it were delicious beyond words. &#160;The seafood bisque is also really good, but probably not as special as the chowder. &#160;Price is reasonable: A little over $5 for a small, which may look small when you are hungry for chowder, but will fill you up because it has so much stuff in it (and the cream and bacon adds up the calories too). &#160;Service is quick and seating is comfortable. &#160;This place is a must for visits to Seattle. When you peek inside, you only see what looks more like a deli counter, holding no more than 15 seats in the place. The establishment is set up for quick and affordable lunches, since they are only open from 10am - 2pm. We saw the lines, and decided to stop by for a snack, so we shared a small cup of Seared Scallop Chowder, which ran us about $6. &#160;The dill and lime juice added a refreshing and calming feel to the thick white broth which a typical clam chowder is based upon. &#160;The Seared Scallop was a fantastic choice, filled with noticeable bites of full scallops. &#160;The surprisingly simple and clean flavors left us happy and wanting more. Our only regret is that we didn't come sooner or more often - as our first visit was the morning before we flew out of Seattle. If we ever make it back to Seattle (which we're already planning on) Pike Place Chowder is a definite stop. It's hard to excite someone from the San Francisco area with Clam Chowder (since Fisherman's Wharf is well-known for their clam chowder in a bread bowl), but this place is pretty excellent for the following reasons!:1) They have a variety of clam chowders you can choose from (original New England, Southwestern, Seafood Bisque, and the list goes on!). We tried the New England and Seafood -- both very excellent choices.2) Bountiful amount of fresh HUGE pink lil' clam chunk morsels swimming in your chowder! 3) Unlimited pieces of bread! You do NOT have to order your chowder in a bread bowl here because they have a whole basket-full of bagged sourdough break chunks for you to fill-up on leisurely at no extra cost if needed! (The bread pieces are the pieces they extract from the inside of the bread bowls).In fact, I'd suggest you NOT order your chowder in a bread bowl (as I stupidly did...not seeing the unlimited bread thing) because it costs about $2.50 more and just enjoy the chowder itself.Only down-side of this place is its price. About $6 for a small cup of chowder, or about $9 for chowder in the bread bowl. (It's only $6 for the chowder in a bread bowl in SF!)Ambiance wise -- very laid back and chill. Expensive as hell but it's so delicious it doesn't even matter. &#160;Sure, New England may be the home of the clam chowder but Seattle has the great chowder weather year-round. &#160;Pike Place Chowder has perfected the art of chowder-making. The only problem is that a large (not very large if it's cold and rainy outside) will cost you $7. &#160;Apparently, the owner of this place competed in a prestigious national chowder cook-off and won the competition so many times that they stopped inviting him back in order to give other people a chance to win. &#160;Yes, it's that good. Before attending Pike Place Chowder I read a review fom a woman wishing she could eat the clam chowder every week (even though she lived in SF). I now second that opinion.Please ship me a huge bowl to Mississippi every week!Delish, and cannot wait to try a bowl of the seafood bisque!Additionally, the place was packed and the staff brought a table in from the chilly outdoors so we could stay warm and eat our chowder inside. Mad props! Awesome "chowdah"! WOW!!!! Their market chowder was amazing! &#160;It is made entirely of fresh ingredients from the Pike's Place market. &#160;Changing daily, this chowder is dynamic and not too heavy. &#160;It was also great in a bread bowl. Very affordable compared to mainland chowder. Oh Pike Place Chowder how I love thee. Let me express my love through haiku:I love your chowder.How do you make it so good?You fill my tummy.Their chowder is award winning. Enough said. Have I reviewed this place yet? IT's fantabulous!!!!! My cousin and I were on vacay in Seattle and we had to find a clam chowder to make up for the Monterey Bay clam chowder she had to sacrifice after we switched our "road trip" to a "train trip."Hoping that Seattle yelpers were a little more on point than their CA counterpoints (sorry people but a lot of the LA reviews I've read are glorifed hypes of crap places. One love.), I yelped "chowder" and Pike Place came up. I perused a few reviews while my cousin did what she did and we headed out.I ordered the Salmon chowder since it was advertised as a "Seattle favorite" (Proud Tourist here!!!) and threw in the Dungeness crab roll since people seem to love it.Thank you locals because it was all delicious. The crab roll was real crab and it was super fresh. This would be my monthly (since I don't want to get fat) brunch place if I lived in Seattle. Traveled up to seattle from San Francisco. &#160;I had the seafood bisque in a bread bowl and it was probably the best chowder i've ever had. &#160;Very filling, not too salty, and a lot of seafood in it. &#160;Ate it outside in the 30F cold and I was very happy. &#160;The Crab Roll was also very good, but not as good as the chowder. &#160;5 stars all the way.Only negative is that it gets crowded and seating is limited Constant lines! This place is pretty good and well known for their chowder. I'm glad they made combo Meals , because I didn't want just chowder. I opted for the Crab Sandwich with Chowder &amp; Drink. I liked the chowder more than the sandwich! Manage to swoop on some tables and chairs and you are set! Nobody wants to eat outside in the rain! Being a clam chowder lover, I hunted this place down upon visiting Seattle for a vacation trip. The natives of the area directed us to the shop and the line wasn't long at all although we did go on a Thursday. Everything about the chowder was DELICIOUS. I don't know if it was the environment or whether or not the idea of just sitting in the middle of the tourist spot while eating world famous chowder made it that more delicious, but all of my friends and I agreed that this was simply the BEST chowder we have ever tasted. So much so, that we ventured there AGAIN to eat it one more time before we left to go to California. We also contemplated bringing a tub of chowder in our luggage so we could eat it when we got back home. Yes..its THAT GOOD, trust me. Ok, my family were here during the Thanksgiving weekend.It's so crowded during lunch! I think the reason why people come here is because the big sign where it says "#1 Best Chowder 200X" etc. Or something like that (well, other than it was recommended by others or through yelp).I ordered ofcourse their "famous" clam chowder and crab sandwich. To be honest, not my favorite clam chowder. It's kind a salty and... not sure about the other reason but not the clam chowder I was expecting.The crab cake is just ok... I think it needed more lemon or lime juice. I might go back again if I have a visitor from out of the country or state. Or... I'd rather take my visitor to Athenian instead (see my other review).Other than that, it's just 4 stars. The chowder is a MUST when visiting Seattle and the Pike Place Market! Long line at lunch out the door - check! Not just tourists in line - check! Person taking my order with Boston accent - check! I love clam chowder and this was the best I have ever had, by far. The creaminess of the broth was perfect, especially combined with the bread bowl. The clams were large and not overcooked. All of this for around $7, well worth the price. The one negative is finding a seat can be a challenge, but that comes with the territory when coming across such a great find! I am ready to buy another ticket back to seattle just for this place.Had a bowl of salmon clam chowder with a delicious dungeness crab sandwich.Clam chowder = ambrosiaIt was sooooo good. Unlike the other places in seattle that boasts "best clam chowder" this place really does have the best. The chowder is actually CHUNKY and you can't go a bite w/out getting delicious potatoes and clams.Definitely a must-visit for anyone cruising downtown seattle! OPEN WIDE...and let the warm white soup drizzle into your mouth...Man this clam chowder is good! It contains fresh ingredients (cause hello the ocean is damn near a foot away!) Screw buying a cup of chowder man I buy the tanker load! It's that damn good! Located in the heart of Pike Place Market, it might be a little tricky to initially find this place, but you'll be surprised once you find it, how many people are eating at this place.This place definitely has more kinds of chowder than any other place that I've been to. If you've only had clam chowder, you're in for a treat with the manhattan chowder, salmon chowder, bisques, etc. I had the sampler, which gives you 4 smaller cups of chowders of your choice from their selection. I think this choice is a good way for people to try out a little of everything. If you're on a date, get the sampler and maybe a sandwich/roll and share everything. Just like Pike Place Market, this place is a must visit if you're new to the Seattle area. It's one of many great places to experience the seafood culture in our city. Even for the typical Seattlite, it's a great place to have lunch on a day in Pike's. I've lived in Seattle for just over a year now and I've sampled many chowders. &#160;Above all others is Pike Place Chowder. &#160;I judge a good chowder mostly by its richness (salt+fat) and clam content. &#160;Pike chowder manages to bring me to the borderline between euphoria and illness that I crave. &#160;Other chowders normally leave me with enough metabolism left to continue being productive at work. &#160;Sometimes, I even have to use -their- chowders as a starter for something else -fish and chips, a sandwich, etc. &#160;Not at Pike. &#160;I haven't even bothered to try anything but their standard white clam variety. &#160;I'm sure the others are just as sinful and wonderful.BTW: &#160;For those who are concerned about the tourists and crowding - there is a location at Pacific Place. Four chowder 5 oz samplers for $10! Perfect way to sample as much chowder as possible. And they have all the oyster crackers, bread, and butter you want to go with the chowder. Loved the regular and the seafood bisque. The smoked salmon chowder was pleasing too, but personally not a fan of smoked salmon to begin with. If you love smoked salmon, you'll love that chowder. The only one that was a miss was the seared scallop chowder because the dill and lemon was overpowering in that one. Miss.I've seen a few comparisons to Splash Cafe, so I'm gonna put in my vote: Pike Place Chowder wins in my book. The clam chowder here is the best I've ever had. &#160;I tried both the chowder and the seafood bisque, and while I don't think I would probably order the bisque again; I would eat that chowder like there's no tomorrow. &#160;Apparently it won the national chowder contest too many times and they aren't allowed to enter it anymore, whoops! &#160;And the portions are out of control, I'm pretty sure I could not actually finish one of the bread bowl servings if I tried, it's phenomenal. Pike Place Chowder is a great casual place to grab a bite to eat after strolling around Pike Place Market. &#160;Although the line was out the door, it moved quickly and we were able to find a seat pretty easily by the time the food was ready.We decided to go for cups of the clam chowder and seafood bisque, which was still pretty filling. &#160;The clam chowder was a bit sweet, buttery, and very creamy. &#160;The seafood bisque, was hearty, savory, and a bit peppery. &#160;Both were solid chowders, thick and full of fresh seafood.The sourdough bread which came with the soup was soft and doughy. &#160;It lacked the yeasty crunchy crust of sourdough and tasted more like a standard dinner roll.Overall, Pike Place Chowder is part of the Pike Place Market experience and I'm glad I got a chance to try their famous clam chowder. &#160;However, I still think Splash Cafe in Pismo Beach, CA makes the best clam chowder I've tasted. My sisters and I are from Orange County, CA. &#160;We love clam chowder, but have only had the stuff from around here. &#160;Before visiting, we were told to visit Ivar's, but when we got to Downtown Seattle, it was just so much easier (and more fun) to walk around and explore. &#160;We couldn't find Ivar's, but we did find this charming chowder place. &#160;And boy am I ever so pleased that we did. &#160;It really was love at first spoonful! &#160;We had the original and it blew us away (I'm regretting not trying their seafood bisque). &#160;The morning that we were leaving Seattle, we made sure we got ourselves another bowl before we left. &#160;Now that it's starting to get "chilly" in So. Cal. I can't help but dream of their creamy clam chowder.They do ship, but alas, the shipping is more than the soup! One of the top 5 places in Pikes Place to visit in my opinion.I brought my friend who happened to get sick right before our trip. &#160; She wasn't feeling well at all so I figured some good hearty chowder would do the trick. &#160;And it did! &#160;She requested more the next day loldecor-casual market place.service-friendly and let us sample whatever chowder we requested.smoked salmon chowder-creamy goodness with just the right amount of smokiness. &#160;I was worried that it'd be too salty, but the flavors were perfectly balanced with the smokiness of the salmon, and right amount of cream.New England chowder-it was classic, with chunks of clam and potatoes. &#160;what more can you ask for on a slightly cloudy day in Seattle :) This establishment is in the thick of the Seattle Clam Chowder Wars. &#160;Never heard of it? &#160;Yeah, me neither but I'm fairly certain it exists. &#160;Ask any Seattle local and any one them would tell you where the best place to get local clam chowder is. &#160;Is it Duke's? &#160;Ivars? &#160;No, I give you Pike Place Chowder. While the varieties of clam chowder are rather impressive, I prefer the crab roll. &#160;$12 plus for a hefty portion of Dungeness Crab, mayo, green onions, and spices all served up on a sour dough roll. &#160;Simple, delicious and filling. &#160;While $12 may seem like a steep price for a sandwich this one is a nice splurge to make when visiting Pike and when feeling "crabby". &#160;Get a side of chowder if you are super hungry. &#160;It's worth it! Award winning indeed!!!!!! I just returned to LA from Seattle yesterday. I totally used yelp to help me find all the best hot spots and eatery's. This place was one of them. I ordered the regular calm chowder served in a sourdough bread bowl, yums. This chowder is made with beacon so you can imagine the flavors. It was the best chowder I ever had. &#160;The service is fast and friendly.This place is kind of pricey but so worth it. Verdict: It is hands down the best!!! =) I go to get chowder there about 2 times a week. The seared scallop chowder is the best chowder in the city as far as I am concerned. They are always efficient and the soup is always hot and tasty.Con: People who chat at their tables for too long after eating the awesome soup. Move it people! Let us all eat! They have you fooled. They don't serve chowder. It can't be chowder, because I don't like chowder. I've never liked chowder. But for some reason I love this thick white clam broth they serve and call chowder. I love it. It's delicious. Tried the bisque and wasn't a huge fan but the regular "chowder" is delicious.BTW, don't waste your money or the room in your stomach on the sandwiches. Also, seating can be a hassle so grab one before you order. Oh yeah, there are a bunch of annoying tourists everywhere (like us). I ordered the 4 cup chowder sampler and ranked them in order of preference:1. &#160;Original CLAM CHOWDER2. &#160;SEAFOOD BISQUE3. &#160;SEARED SCALLOP4. &#160;SMOKED SALMON CHOWDEROverall, the chowders were delicious!! &#160;Original was my favorite flavor. &#160;I liked smoked salmon the least but my friend liked it the most, so it's all a matter of personal preference. &#160;If only they sold the original clam chowder in a can ... Being a Bay Area native I thought that I had tasted good clam chowder in the past. Boy was I wrong after I had tried the epic goodness that is served at Pike Place Chowder. Folks. I could hardly utter a word while eating, I just sat their amazed at how good it was. The soup was thick and hearty with fresh ingredients. OHHHHHHH SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOD. It was so good that I had to bring back a few containers for my family to try (and they all agreed). There was an adequate amount of seating. The staff was kind and helpful in packing my travel container (for the flight home). I'm pretty sure the looks on the other customers faces were pure bliss. Thanks to Pike Place for introducing me to the best clam chowder this side of the Mississippi. Let me sum this up by saying, if there's a cheap flight from LA to Seattle, I'd absolutely take it just to have some of this deliciousness. &#160;I was there in September 2009 and am still thinking about it TODAY. &#160;We were only in Seattle for 2 days and went to Pike's both days. &#160;We even bought a togo container to take home with us. &#160;It's worth checking in your luggage. &#160;This is an absolute MUST EAT if you're visiting Seattle! We stopped in Seattle on the way to Whistler and had a craving for some seafood goodness. Boy did we find it at Pike Place! We had the chowder sampler (New England Clam Chowder, Smoked Salmon Chowder, Special Shrimp Chowder, Seared Scallop Chowder) and a Dungeness Crab Roll. It was all sooooo fresh, hearty and fullfilling. Oh, gah I think I just drooled on my keyboard just thinking about it. Seattle and I became good friends last week. &#160;The Emerald City shared it's foodie secrets, one of which was this joint.Great value. &#160;Off the hook chowder.I loved it so much that it sandwiched my stay in Seattle. I had the Seared Scallop Chowder on my first day in the city. And, on my last day, I had the Smoked Salmon Chowder. I killed both meals.Each time, I ordered the 8oz. bowl (which runs ~$6 something). Yes, it was just the right serving size; it made me full. If you really want, you can get more slices of bread to soak up the chowder hiding in the fold of the bottom of the paper bowl.REALLY -- just go. &#160;WHAT TO DO IF YOU CAN'T CHOOSE ONE: &#160;Don't stress. &#160;Get the 4 chowder sampler that runs ~$11 and well worth it. You get 4 oz. servings of your choice of 4 chowders. That's 4 oz. of each chowder choice. My husband got it in order to try the seared scallop chowder, the seafood bisque, the chowder of the day, and the classic New England. &#160;He was overfull by the time he finished. &#160;I "had" to help him finish the New England.HOW TO GET TO IT: &#160;Stay on the right side of the Pike St sidewalk. &#160;Continue on as the sidewalk curves right. &#160;It will eventually fork, with Pike St. on the left and Post Alley on the right. &#160;Walk down Post Alley just a bit and Pike Place Chowder will be on your right.SEATING AREA: &#160;Small, but I saw a party of 9 work it out. This is absolutely my favorite clam chowder place ever! Found this place on the food tour that I took last year. Each time I'm in Seattle, I always have to make a stop here for their delicious clam chowder! It's a pretty small shop and they offer a number of varieties of chowder and bisque. (For example, they have the scallop chowder (tastes kinda tarty), seafood bisque, and etc.) The best is still the clam chowder! Oh, and they also serve the soups with the inside of the bread bowl. Remember to get the clam chowder first if you're ever here! Really good chowder and seafood bisque. it was great to get out of the rain and get some hot chowder. Surprisingly tasty, hearty and affordable for such a touristy place like this. Dont bother with the "Crab" sandwich. Its some boring crab meat in boring baguette with cocktail sauce. Dear New England Style Clam Chowder,I can't stop thinking about you. I miss your savory scent, the smooth and flavorful way you taste, your chunks of clams, and well chowder..I miss everything about you. There's no other chowder in my world- please...let's be exclusive. I could never want another. Oh chowder, my darling, if only our distance were not an issue...I know I can order you online and have you show up right at my door waiting for me to devour you. Maybe it's for the best, while my mouth is telling me yes, my body is telling me NO! Maybe we can just have a hot elicit affair when I make it up to Seattle again. Oh that will be quite the rendezvous. Let's make it exciting and bring your friend, Dungeness Crab Sandwich...she's a hot little number too! Amidst the tourist trapping of Post Alley, this little joint serves up a yummy array of chowders. &#160;They have a small counter a a few tables and on a nice day you can sit out in the alley and listen to whomever has landed their musical chops outside.The flagship chowder is yummy, but I must recommend the chicken and corn chowder. &#160;Creamy and chunky goodness and they don't skimp on the clams or chicken in their chowders. &#160;They offer a 4 chowder sampler for 10 bucks which is more than enough for two to share for a light snack. &#160;I like going that rout since you get to try different things including whatever their special chowder of the day is.Service is fast and the food is hot. &#160;What more can you ask for? If I lived in Seattle, I would probably be stoping by everyday. They really do have the best clam chowder. I've traveled all over the place and have tasted a lot of Clam Chowder, but this place does serve one of the best clam chowder I've ever tasted. Before our trip to Seattle, I was looking around for places to eat on Yelp, and that's how I found out about this place. This was our first stop after we checked in to our hotel. We ordered the special, which came with a cup of chowder and crab rolls. Excellent. We ate here almost everyday while we were in Seattle. To be honest with you, if it wasn't for the excellent food, I probably wouldn't come back. I'm OCD, and I don't like eating with pigeons watching me. I feel like they're just waiting for me to look away so they can come steal my food. If I lived in Seattle, I'd probably be doing take out instead of eating there.Supposedly, you can order your chowder and they'll mail it to you. I am intrigued, but I'm scared that it wouldn't turn out as good as I remember it and it'd ruin it for me, so I'm yet to order. But as I'm writing this review, I am thinking of the wonderful chowder. Maybe I'll order after all. We went on a Seattle Food Tour , and we stopped by Pike Place Chowder and had a chance to try the Seafood Bisque. I really liked it, but the Mr. preferred the chowder. I got there shortly after they opened... &#160;The place was starting to get crowded already (on a Thursday, no less!). &#160;This was a Yelp recommendation and I was not let down, I am new to Clam Chowder, but this was epic. &#160;Delicious, fast, and not expensive at all. &#160;I loved it. The BEST clam chowder I had in recent years!! &#160;Based on a friend's strong recommendation, I was up in Seattle for business and stop by here for lunch. &#160;Even with high expectations and skepticism. &#160;(I mean, I had some of the best chowders in Boston in the past,) I was pleasantly surprised at how good this chowder was! &#160;Generous portions of clams and potatoes, and the cream was not too heavy, not too light, just right. &#160;Bottom line, this is WAY better than any chowder in SF, I wish I can come back here more often! &#160;I also had the Dungeness Crab roll, which was spectacular! &#160;There were so much crab that each bite, I was in a pure state of bliss. &#160;With the clam chowder, it was such a good lunch that I ALMOST had tears in my eyes! &#160;Highly recommended! Small little place in a small alley.Among the many variety of chower they have, we ordered the "sampler" so we could try more out in smaller volume. &#160;We had the original, Manhattan and seafood chowder. &#160;They were pretty interesting since I've never had any other style of clam chowder but the ordinary white creamy one. &#160;It's perfect in the cold Seattle winter. &#160;Delicioso!! I was a little disappointed after reading the rave reviews and seeing all the awards for Pike Place Chowder. I was happy that I signed up for the newsletter online and received a coupon for a free bowl of chowder though.Although I did find the original and seafood bisque chowders both very tasty it might not be the best that I've had, but like I said, I was very happy while eating combined with fantastic music and even better company :) The service was not very good given that this is a tourist "hot spot". I didn't expect a chipper go-getter but I also didn't expect to know that she hated her job. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and think that she was just having a bad day? Most likely will try this place again but only after I've finished trying everything else yummy @ Pike Place. Thanks to Yelp and Chowhound, we made Pike Place Chowder a stop on during our brief visit to Seattle. In fact, we wish we had gone back, and if it hadn't been for a 3+ hour car ride back to Portland, would have gotten some to take home with us.I tried the seafood bisque, and found it to be just plain tasty. Props to the oyster crackers that remind me of my childhood. The sourdough bread slice was also nice, and more sophisticated than the crackers. &#160;Others tried the New England clam chowder, and loved their bowls of soup. I tried it too and also found it good, though i still prefer the slight tomatoey tang of the bisque. The only disappointment was the dungeness crab roll, which we found bland and too heavy on lettuce and bread. The chowders of the day also looked very tempting, but were sold out by the time we arrived, around 2. Except for the sandwich, everything else was great, and we all found the small size perfect for our late lunch. The next time i am in Seattle, I will be back. A little pricey for the amount of food you get; for the quality, totally worth it.Everyone raves about the Boston clam chowder, yes it's good. After you've tried that out, hit up the Manhattan style red chowder; its divine clam brininess shines through the heavens, parting the groggy clouds of travel fatigue. Simply, amazing ;D If you love chowder then you will LOVE this place- I am willing to bet you a dollar for it! &#160;The decor is nothing fancy but the chowder you blow you away. &#160;Words cannot describe how perfect their chowder is- oh wait, yah it can -awarding winning-. &#160;The clam chowder is perfect, the smoked salmon chowder is awesome too, and I love love their southern chicken corn chowder. &#160;Each bowls of chowder comes with a slice of bread (also very yummy).It's not cheap, and probably not healthy either, but it taste so good!Try it out, you won't regret it. The Classic Chowder and Seafood Bisque were both VERY delicious! How do they do it? Simple... they use a lot of cream. Cream makes everything that much better! If you're a calorie counter, beware... even the small bowl packs a huge punch! But if you're on vacation, it's definitely worth the indulgence :-) Lots of big chunks of clams, fish, shrimp, etc. Yum! I want to go back for more... Seating is a bit of a pain in the rain, but we made due. There were a couple guys sitting at a table, obviously finished with their meal, but they just sat there taking up space... This place was packed, with a line out the door in the rain, and it didn't even phase them. We found a couple seats at the counter and made do. After reading the reviews on this place, I knew this would have to be a definite visit during my stay in Seattle on the weekend. &#160;I was really excited. Yes, I really can get excited about things like this. &#160;And since we were eating our way through Seattle anyway, this surely must be a stop.Upon ordering my seafood bisque in a bread bowl, the moral dilemma was raised that there was only one bread bowl left. &#160;My friend ordered before me....the look of guilt on her face...the look of childlike disappointment on mine. &#160;Having seen this, the girl working there stated "let me figure something out" and came back with a second breadbowl. &#160;Very good customer service! &#160;However, as soon as we walked away with our soupy goodness in hand, I turned back to grab a napkin and then observed her grab the bread bowl sitting on the front counter on display (and therefore not very fresh and likely touched by patrons) and put it on the counter ready for the next lucky unsuspecting last patron to get a bread bowl. &#160;Eww. &#160;I wonder where mine came from? &#160;I choose not to ponder. &#160;This is the only reason I give this place 3 stars, otherwise the seafood bisque was lovely in its (questionable origin) bread home with yummy oyster crackers. Kept me full (literally) all day long! Everything our group shared was incredible (crab roll, shrimp roll, market chowder, NE clam chowder) but the NE clam chowder may be the best version I'll ever taste. PPC is now a "must have" for every trip to Seattle. Ooh, you know I love me some clam chowder! &#160;I had to make a stop at Pike Place Chowder after seeing Jessica T's review on Yelp! &#160;Pike Place Market was the first stop on our trip and we were ready to chow down on chowder for lunch. &#160;This place is located in Post Alley and can be hard to find - don't be fooled! &#160;It's not in the main Market building. &#160;Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating - perfect for a sunny day! &#160;The bf and I decided to split New England clam chowder in a bread bowl and a cup of the market chowder that day which had corn, chorizo, and oysters. &#160;The market chowder was a bit watery but I did like the flavor. &#160;The New England was delish!! &#160;I've had better bread bowls at other places but you can't go wrong with the chowder itself. &#160;Lunch came out to about $14 for two people - not too shabby!!I love that you can grab some extra bread at the counter if you need it. &#160;Very clean and organized utencil/napkin/condiment section and service is really fast! Yum! I have been a fan for years-- even before I stepped foot into Seattle. I first had Pikes Place Chowder in Newport RI at the Great Chowder Cook Off where Larry and his team from Pikes Place won first place.I knew in my trip to Seattle we had to see where all the magic takes place. Its right in the heart of Pikes Place. We had the seafood bisque and the Corn and Crab-- Yum! We got both to go and share them as we walked through the market. There was a line for a busy Saturday-- but it was definitely worth the wait! Pikes Place is the best I think I had died and gone to heaven after eating the crab roll!Seriously, it was soooooooooooo damn good. $12.00 sandwhich full of fresh crab mixed in with celery, lemon, a tint of mayo, salt and pepper on a fresh french roll....................................DA DA DAMN!I am making my bf stop there on our way to Whistler just so I can have that again. Best New England style clam chowder I have ever had yet! &#160;Creamy and rich, but not so much that it drowns out the flavors of the clams and vegetables; great texture--lots of chunks of clam and veges. &#160;Really wonderful! &#160;$7.95 for chowder in a bread bowl. &#160;Cup of chowder will set you back about $5. &#160;Sourdough bread bowl was ok, but nothing to write home about, but that's ok since it's not San Francisco and they're not making any claims about the bread ;-) &#160;Great deal given it's touristy location.We also tried the scallop chowder, but it had too much dill for our taste (even for hubby, who loves the herb). Before we headed to Seattle, Kym C./Jenn C. and I decided we would split EVERYTHING so we could eat more. Our first lunch before making our way around Pike Place Market and we caved and each got our own meal. We were starving and the aroma of the soup wafted into the alley. Mmmm.. We each ended up with their combo of clam chowder + half crab roll + soda. The soup is very hearty and definitely deserves its reputation for being the best! It's flavorful with huge chunky pieces of clams and veggies. It felt so good and a breezy day! The crab roll is filled with crab and veggies in a toasty roll, but isn't heavy at all! I loved how it was light and refreshing, but so simple and flavorful. We were all very pleased with our meal - definitely a good lunch and lucky for us, we got a table indoors by the window and didn't have to fight with seagulls for our lunch! A little lunch counter tucked away in an alley across from the waterfront in downtown Seattle. &#160;My wife and I stopped in for lunch. &#160;We each got a bread bowl of clam chowder and split a Dungeness crab roll. &#160;The clam chowder was excellent, though pricey at $9 apiece. &#160;It was full of clams. &#160;The crab roll was OK-somewhat bland. &#160;I still enjoyed the meal and it was a lot of food. &#160;The seating is pretty sparse and they can get crowded. &#160;Still and all, the food was very good and I would look for it again the next time I'm in town. I must say their chowder's almost as good as SF's clam chowder! it's THAT good!! we had a cup of clam chowder, a cup of seafood bisque, and dungeness crab sandwich. &#160;the soup is so flavorful with chunky seafood pieces. it was perfect way to start my morning on a slightly breezy day.. mmm i need to go back.. We came here for lunch. &#160;The line was pretty long but it moved fast and there was seating indoors for us by the window. &#160;We all opted for the lunch special which is half a crab roll and a cup of their infamous clam chowder and a drink, all for $10.25. &#160;The crab roll was really tasty and it had a great amount of crab in it and was really fresh, even the roll was fresh! &#160;The clam chowder was very delicious and had a lot of clams in it! &#160;It totally hit the spot!! &#160;I wish I could have a cup of soup right now! Nations best... You really can't go wrong. &#160;Long story short... GO NOW!!! Mix Clam with Scallop Chowder!!!! My bf and I passed Pikes Place Chowder while wondering around Pike's Market and so glad we stopped for a bowl of Clam Chowder. &#160;It was one of the best tasting Clam Chowder I've had. &#160;Creamy, hearty, not too dense and full of ingredients! &#160;They did not skimp out on the clams, potatoes and fixins. &#160;I love it accompanied with Westminster Oyster Crackers (best oyster crackers eva!!!) &#160;My bf and I shared the bowl of chowder, since we picked up Beechers Mac and Cheese to lunch with it. &#160;I fished out the crackers in the chowder, which left my bf with most of the rich flavorful chowder. &#160;Pikes Place Chowder is so Money! &#160;hahahaha! One of the BEST chowders I've had including San Francisco Pier 39 chowders. &#160;deliciously filled with clams and not overlaoded with potatoes. &#160;As for the crab sandwich...I've had better. Just phenomenal chowder. Friends and I got the four-chowder sampler. I had the New England clam chowder, Market chowder, Smoked Salmon chowder and Seafood bisque--and all were fantastic. Five stars is rare for me, but this one deserves it. I LOVE the chowder from Pike's Place Chowder. &#160;It is simply the best chowder I have ever eaten, and it completely struck me off guard. &#160;I ate there, not have read a review before ... I just walked past it and decided to eat there, and it blew me away. &#160;Then I checked Yelp and realized I wasn't crazy, everyone else thought so too! pike place chowder is in a little busy alley with not a lot of seating. I got the seafood bisque which was really good too. I tried the salmon chowder which had cream cheese (not a fan of cream cheese in my food) but that was good. I am going to assume everything is really good here. Delicious chowder!!! &#160;The crab sandwich was a little dissapointing but did I mention the delicious chowder!!! Just great chowder. &#160;Not much to say that the other 220+ reviews don't, but The 4.5 star average doesn't lie. &#160;This was definitely the best chowder I've had. &#160;At a lot of places the clam chowder consists of a few pieces of clam and a bunch of potatoes. &#160;Here, you get clams. &#160;Lots of fresh clams. &#160;The soup was perfectly seasoned and not too salty like many places. &#160;After reading the reviews, I think we were lucky at the time we went because there were only a few people in line. &#160;My only regret is not trying some of the other soups, but maybe that's good because now I have something to look forward to on the next trip to Seattle. Delicious! &#160;It's a hard call to make when deciding where the eat lunch at the market, but Pike Place Chowder is always a winning choice. &#160;Their basic white chowder is delicious and I could eat it every day without getting sick of it. &#160;There are other kinds that are tasty too, but it's hard for me to stray from what I've tested to be good. &#160;It should be noted that I am a native New Englander and grew up on the "real stuff." &#160;As such, I wouldn't recommend their red chowder (as compared to my lifetime experience with RI red), but I can fully endorse the "NE" white chowder. &#160; I would also advise against the dungess crab roll -- not particularly flavorful and overpriced, in my opinion. I was in Seattle for a conference and was there for 5 days. &#160;I had chowder here 3 days in a row...and even bought some to take home with! &#160;The chowders are outstanding. I'm sure there is one stick of butter per bowl of the scallop chowder but it is totally worth the calories. &#160;I think their clam chowder, seafood bisque, and smoked salmon soups were all totally yummy too (yes I tried all four)! &#160;The crab roll though I have to say was just "meh". &#160;It wasn't bad just didn't have a lot of flavor and with killer chowders like that on the menu I would not get the crab roll. The dungeness crab roll was SO FRESH, and they are generous with the crab too. The seafood bisque chowder was my first experience with this variation of clam chowder, and it did not disappoint! Fresh clams, great chowder consistency, and not too salty. I really enjoyed eating outside at the tables in the cute alleyway. When the weather's beautiful, it's quite a serene and pleasant experience. Music from local artists help set the scene as well. I hope I can come back here soon! :] We came here in the morning, and I had the clam chowder. My company had the seafood bisque. I enjoyed his more than mine! Darn it. The clam chowder was still good though, but nothing special. I am from San Francisco so . . . yeah. Ha. The reviews don't lie. Definitly a great cup of chowder. It was a little hard to find in the sea of people and shops that is Pike Street but thanks to Yelp and my Iphone I finally found it. Was in Seattle for vacation and tried this place based on the stellar views. I'm an East-Coaster and no joke, this place had the best clam chowder I've ever had in my life! Didn't think that was possible outside of New England. Also tried the seafood bisque which was great as well. They give you lots of fresh seafood in the soup and the taste, texture, everything is phenomenal. Was quite busy when we went, keep in mind the place opens at 11 and closes at 5!!! I had tried to go the day before at 445 and it was already closing up shop. And when I went the next day at noon, the chowder of the day was already sold out! I also tried the crab roll, it was not bad but I guess I don't like cold crab meat so much. The combo values are good though, for $11 you get half a roll, a cup of soup, and a drink. Definitely not to be missed if you're in town and want to try great chowder! MMM chowder. &#160;This place is right off pike street in post alley and great for lunch. &#160;I had the seafood bisque and my boyfriend had the clam chowder. &#160;They both were great but the clam chowder is the best on the menu. Service is fast at Pike Place Chowder, they are accustomed to the mobs of people in the market during lunch hours. &#160;Their classic chowder is fantastic and the salmon chowder is a great option for those seeking something a little different. &#160;The real draw is their fluffy, flavorful sourdough bread bowls;well worth the extra $1.50! ok. Simply delicious!!!! I ordered one of their combo meals with a crab roll, lobster chowder and a medium beverage. I've tried many chowders from various coastal states, but this was one of my favorites. Perfect balance of ingredients and oh so fresh! Awesome way to end my trip to Pike Place. REALLY good chowder and crab sandwich, but I'm removing one star for the bad service. &#160;The cashier forgot my drink and almost over charged me and the soup scooping people disappeared during a busy lunch hour, which slowed the line down. Found on Yelp. &#160;We wanted a light delicious lunch and found it. &#160;Great little place with good music, fresh bread and great chowder. &#160;It is very casual so don't expect anything more than the good food. &#160;I'm coming back to try the sandwiches. the clam chowder is the best here. I never drink clam chowder because its fattening but i had to make an exception here bc it is just that good. i had a couple of bites of my husbands clam chowder and i can see why so many people like it. the manhattan clam chowder is really good too. i had two large bowls each time i go. the bread bowls kinda suck though. the bread falls a part and tastes kinda stale but other than that this place is the best. Clam chowder is nice and mild. Not too sea foody and not too creamy. Much lighter than Splash Cafe in SLO California. &#160;The crab roll taste like shrimp cocktail on a roll! 4 cup sampler for $10.95.we tried the clam chowder, the seafood bisque, the smoked salmon clam chowder, and the chowder of the day.the plain clam chowder (which is anything but plain) was my favorite. &#160;salty, creamy, and super flavorful. &#160;kind of perfect for seattle weather. Had the classic new england chowder. &#160;Ordered the large but couldn't finish it because it is way bigger than it looks. &#160;What makes this chowder different than all others that I had is that it is very hearty and actually full of clams. &#160;Very delicious and highly recommended. &#160;Nice staff. &#160;Place can be a bit hard to find.... Great clam chowder, comparable to the Monterey Bay clam chowder in California. &#160;The restaurant is a little hard to spot as its not in the main Pike Place Market but rather in the alley. &#160;Each bite is loaded with clams, potatoes and pieces of bacon, not overly watery and not overly creamy, hot and fresh with a side of sourdough bread. I'm curious about all the other menu items as they've got many seafood based soups and bisques. Pike Place Chowder has my all time favorite chowder! The scallop chowder is heaven in a bowl! The scallops are tender and perfect and the base doesn't overwhelm their beautiful flavor. I also had tastes of their Seafood Bisque, YUM; the salmon chowder, YUM; and the clam chowder. The clam chowder wasn't my favorite, and I am sure that there are plenty of peop's out there who would disagree with me, but I found it to be too salty (I really don't like to taste salt, I just want it to enhance flavors) and too rich. My fave clam chowder is still here in San Diego at the Briganteen. But Pike Place Chowder still gets five stars from me just because of that amazing, yummy, and absolutely perfect scallop chowder. PLEASE open a place in San Diego!!!! Wow. If I worked at Pike Place Market any longer, I'm sure I would have gained weight from eating this delicious chowder. It wasn't very nice to my pocketbook either. But my tastebuds were in love. I'm a big fan of the New England Chowder. Heaven in every bite.. I enjoy New England Clam Chowder, so much so that I'll even get it at Denny's (eww)! So when I read the reviews of this place I knew I had to get here pronto. We sat outside, and it was a perfect day for it (not a rain cloud to be seen, no wind, almost 70 degrees, Buck and I must've brought the SoCal sunshine with us on this trip). I wanted the NECC in a bread bowl, but at the last second just went for the regular cup with a slice of sourdough (knew I'd be having MANY beers on this trip so didn't want to carb-load too hard). WOWSIE WOWSIE WOO!! It was seriously the BEST clam chowder I've ever had. Creamy, clammy, not overloaded with potatoes, didn't get weird and runny at the bottom of the bowl like some I've had. Perfection.Christine (the friend I came to visit) had the chicken curry, she said it was good but I didn't try it so can't vouch for that. Buck (the friend I flew up with) had the Crab Sandwich. He gives it a 4 out of 5, I tasted it and a give it a 3, could've had a better sauce on it. &#160;There was a lovely older gentleman playing blues guitar in the court area, and he was awesome. He just played the chorus of the songs, which held Christine's attention (adult onset ADD, she gets distracted easily) and that just made our meal even better. Tasty! I recommend the seared scallop chowder* and fresh lemonade. Their seafood chowder is delicious! The clam chowder is good , but my girl said it was a tad salty. &#160;The seafood bisque is so creamy and yummy ! &#160;I thought about &#160;it the whole time I was in Seatlle , haha &#160;! &#160;The only complaint was that places near Pike Market closes around 5-6 pm on a Friday ! &#160;Shocking for a Vegas couple. Go with the traditional chowder and nothing else. You will not be disappointed!! AWESOME!! Tried out a few chowders, I couldn't decide which one was better,they were just amazing good. My fav place for lunch. When I first moved to Seattle, I went on the Seattle food tour and they gave us a sampling.. after the tour, I went back for more. I stick to the regular clam chowder, and think it's amazing. Love it! I've been back several times, and I think the price is definitely reasonable. Being that it was my first visit to Seattle, I had to check this place out because i LOVE clam chowder, if properly concocted. &#160;My boyfriend and I each got the four 5 oz. sampler, and we tried to mix it up by getting practically everything on the menu. &#160;And to my surprise, the clam chowder was just decent, too chunky for my linking, but what i DID love was the seafood bisque, kinda wished i got four servings of just that. They also serve the chowder with sourdough bread. &#160;You have the choice of sitting inside or outside. &#160;If i lived in Seattle, I'd definitely come back for the seafood bisque! I shared a bread bowl of the New England Clam Chowder. It was pretty freaking good, but the bread bowl soaked up most of the soup so before we knew it all of the soup was gone. It was tasty while it lasted. For over $8 a bread bowl, I would've liked to have more than 4-5 spoonfuls of soup (8-10 if you take into account that I shared it with someone). You gotta go with the New England Chowder. I didn't get to the hotel until around 3pm, and by this time, I was starving! I went here and got the crab roll sandwich and a small bowl of the chowder. Oh boy... they were good! Such a perfect meal for the cold wet Seattle weather. Whew- couldn't find this place for awhile, it's reallyyyyyy small. I had a small cup of the smoke salmond chowder- really amazing. I recommend getting the sampler so you can try more soups. I was only able to make it out here once- will have to come back again to try some of their specialty soups. Just reviewing about chowder a second ago and this place came to mind right off the bat! &#160;Pike Place Chowder definitely offers the BEST chowder I've ever had! &#160;It is beyond amazing, something in life you must try before you can appreciate. &#160;This small little booth place will rope you in and then leave you with a lasting memory and your chowder instinct will forever be changed! &#160;Hahaha. &#160;It is that good. &#160;Highly recommended in my book and put their chowder competition to shame. If I was rating just their standard traditional chowder, I would give it a strong 4 or 5 stars. That stuff was delicious! Definitely some of the best chowder I've had. I sampled three other chowders though and those didn't stand up to the challenge. I tried the Smoked Salmon, Southwest Chicken, and Seafood Bisque. The bisque was the most disappointing and I would rate the smoked salmon and southwest on par with each other. Don't get sucked into the four chowder sample - go straight for the traditional and you won't be disappointed. Probably one of the better chowder places I've ever been too, but I wasn't blown away. So I give it a 4. In Seattle, salmon is pretty good everywhere and accordingly the Salmon Chowder was really delicious. I would recommend that and the cord chowder. YUMMY :) I haven't had better chowder anywhere else. I did the sampler and had the New England, Market, Seafood Bisque and the Salmon bisque. &#160;These folks know how to make great chowder! &#160;If you are in the area and are a chowder fan, definitely stop by! This is really the best Clam chowder I have had in my life. The creaminess was perfect but still not too heavy so as to cover the clams and supporting elements like the potato. How I would love to pack this place up and bring it back home. The market chowder, which features salmon and crab, is great and was my second favorite of the four chowders I tried. The (southwest?) chicken chowder/soup thingy was just ok, I really have had similar things elsewhere that I did like better. But the seafood Bisque did help to seal the five stars for me, it had a great flavor from the alcohol and the same smooth creaminess I got from the first two chowders. This is in my mind a gem of Pikes Place Market. Clam chowder and lobster bisque are amazing. Had a bowl of the traditional clam chowder today, it was fan-freaking-tastic!!! Best chowder I've had so far. I'm excited to go back and try another type. It's a very tiny restaurant so be prepared to have no personal space! Lots of reviews here...some of the best chowder I've had in my life. I had the sampler and would stick with the original as my favorite, although the seared scallop chowder was a very close second. Definitely lived up to the hype, which is a good thing since the location in some hidden alley was pretty tough to find. Best chowder in Seattle. &#160;I always order the salmon chowder. &#160;They serve it with a piece of yummy sour dough bread too. &#160;A must eat spot in Seattle. ahhhh, the allusive pike place chowder. was in town for 3 days and the first two days barely missed closing time by minutes. which leads me to the one small thing that i don't like is that they close a little too early but i guess that's not much of a complaint. i got the seafood bisque which was very excellent. i was pleasantly surprised to see that it came with a piece of sourdough even though i just ordered the cup. there were nice healthy pieces of shrimp and fish. it wasn't too fishy, nor too tomatoey. Believe the hype, this chowder is stupid good. See my stars soooo freakin' good!!! i worked in the mall for over one year without ever eating there, then one day one of my co-workers brought some fish and chips from there and let me have some, and i've been hooked ever since. ive tried some good fish and chips before, but this stuff is incredible, even the tartar sauce is out of this world, make sure you get extra sauce cause youre gonna need it, it'll feel like crack and better than sex!!!(with a fairly mediocre chubby girl) Best chowder I've ever had before in my life This is it. &#160;This is my Pike's Market experience. &#160;I've been looking for it for a year, and I finally found it. &#160;It wasn't at the original Starbucks, and wasn't seeing a tossed fish, but it was very clearly and emphatically at Pike Place Chowder. &#160;On that Sunday the tables were crowded with tourists, half glancing between their chowder and the really terrible street performers, but nobody seemed to mind. &#160;The chowder was compensating for the ear rattling noise coming from a few yards off. &#160;We wedged into a small table and sent out an emissary to the ordering counter, who promptly returned with a bread bowl overflowing with their standard chowder, and a smaller cup of the smoked salmon chowder. &#160;There was also a small slice of bread, and for those with big appetites, a platter of bread bowl cores available for extra dipping. &#160;I tried the smoked salmon chowder first and immediately caught a smoky flavor, though not as much of a salmon flavor. &#160;I then shifted gears to the standard chowder and was really blown away. &#160;It is the best chowder I've had in capable memory. &#160;If I've had a better chowder, I can't remember it. &#160;It even beats the more luxurious chowders from fancier restaurants - good price, too. &#160;The bread bowl's a decent option especially if you're hungry, but I'd probably opt for just eh really big cup. &#160;Or both. &#160;I mean, you can't lose ordering more and more chowder. &#160;Anyhow, that's all we tried, and was way more than sufficient. First stop in Seattle (after our hotel of course) cause we arrived after lunch and were starving. Thanks to all the reviews, I knew it was in Post Alley which is just a little bit north of the main street the market is on so we didn't spend a whole lot of time searching for it. The place isn't huge - 5 tables maybe and a counter with like 5 stools. You order at the counter and then find a place to sit. I ordered the 4 chowder sampler. Too bad they all looked the same and the guy didn't tell me what was what. But they were all delicious. I think my favorite was the scallop. I also got the New England clam, seafood bisque and the market chowder which is like their chowder of the day. I don't remember what the market chowder had in it. But it was pinkish in color similar to the seafood bisque so I couldn't really tell the difference. But they both had a lot of different type of seafoods in it and it wasn't too creamy, which I like. The clam chowder was a bit tangy - different than what I'm normally used to so it was probably my least favorite out of the four. And by the end it all tasted very salty. It came with 2 pieces of bread and all the oyster crackers you want. The free bread bowl near the utensils and napkins was empty so no free bread for us. My companion got the Manhattan clam chowder in the bread bowl. I didn't get to try it but she thought it was super salty. And it looked more like a stew than chowder. Not sure if the bread soaked up all the soupy parts but there's a lot of clams and veggies in it. Also we got to try the crab roll. It was somewhat similar to the lobster roll that's famous in Boston. Anyways you can totally taste that it's fresh crab. Plus I got little bits of shell in my mouth while eating it. It's not a deterrent though - still good. The bread bowl was like $8, the crab sandwich and sampler chowders are like $12 each. All in all very good, and the whole time we were in Seattle, I kept comparing all the clam chowders we tried to this place. And nothing was as good. Been to Seattle twice now, and this was a definite must in going again. &#160;I craved chowder for weeks after coming here. &#160;We had the smoked salmon, new england clam chowder, seafood bisque, scallop chowder, and southwestern chowder. &#160;All excellent!! &#160;I would not recommend the bread bowl however, since the bread is not very fresh or good (minus half star). &#160;Minus another half star for the fact that their water tasted fishy. &#160;However, pluses for free Andes mints! Handsdown, best clam chowder and lobster bisque ive ever had. will never look at clam chowder the same again. i give the service and the chowder 5 stars. but this place is tiny, it was kind of uncomfortable having to be so close to the other customers Easily the best chowder I've ever had! &#160;Got a sampler platter that came with quite a bit of each kind, 4 types. &#160;Great place, when I go back to Seattle I will definitely be going here again! &#160;Don't let the small back alley vibe get you down, it was a really cool environment and great great food! &#160;Plus the girl behind the counter was cute as hell. The chowder here was perfect for the rainy weather outside. &#160;The seafood bisque and clam chowder was delicious. &#160;You don't have to fish for clam and seafood bits. &#160;The space is a bit tight and the price is a bit higher bc of it's location. &#160; Mmm.... just thinking about the chowder from here makes me hungry =) so i think this was one of my favorite foods on our trip to seattle! &#160;people definitely did not lie! &#160;we sampled some clam chowder and lobster bisque from this place on a food tour we went on and both were delicious!! =) &#160;i was happy! &#160;we went back for some clam chowder (because we liked that one the best) later that day because it was so good and we couldn't resist. &#160;prices are decent as well and they give you some bread with chowder if you didn't order a bread bowl. &#160;so yum! &#160;they also have a chowder sampler if you want to try more than one, which is nice. &#160;i would definitely come back here if i'm ever in town again! =D &#160;i kinda want some more now!! =/ The original 'market' chowder is quite good, on par with Ivars - but the best is the smoked salmon chowder. &#160;Salmon and onions and spuds and capers... Mmmm... We were here last week when we were in Seattle. Heard about &#160;this place from fellow yelpers. We were unable to find seats so we took out. Very crowded with limited seats. We had the soup and sandwich combo. The crabmeat was very fresh, &#160;though a little bland. The clam chowder was outstanding,fresh and &#160;heavy with clams and bacon. this place makes the best clam chowder i've ever had in my life. &#160;it's nice and creamy with fresh plump clams. &#160;yummmm!! I'm not a big chowder head but this place has great chowder. The best chowder I've ever had. They serve you fast and it's crazy busy in there. Pretty good price for the chowder. I also had a crab roll and it was stuff with crab. I would go back if I'm in Seattle again. Great place.
I met a friend for dinner in the U District tonight. &#160;She wanted to go vegetarian and I'd vaguely wanted to try Flowers for awhile so we gave it a shot. &#160;She was hoping for the buffet but we were informed it is 11 - 3 only. &#160;The waitress was friendly and attentive. &#160;Several reviews mention slow service but we didn't experience that.My friend ordered a fish entree (tuna?) with salad instead of couscous and I had a chicken sandwich that involved avocado and a dressing that seemed like it would be spicy (Thai chili?). &#160;My friend's dish was the clear winner. &#160;She polished off her salad and loved the fish. &#160;I tried some of the pesto sauce and it had a lemony tang to it. &#160;Yummy. &#160;The pita wedges were good too, not dry or bland.My meal was mostly a failure though the salad was fine. &#160;First off, everything was served room temperature and rapidly progressed to cold. &#160;Second, there were many things wrong with the sandwich. &#160;The bread would have been better if it was toasted. &#160;The chicken was flavorless and contained unappetizing fatty parts. &#160;Both the lettuce and chicken were strange shaped pieces that caused most everything to fall out of the sandwich as I was trying to eat it. &#160;And one part of the chicken looked so undercooked and scary that I put it down and didn't even inspect it. &#160;Third, the fries were greasy, SOGGY, unsalted and cold. &#160;I wasn't even tempted to finish them. &#160;Out of curiosity I looked up the health department restaurant inspection results for Flowers:http://info.kingcounty.g&#8230;Dear god, I am never coming back. &#160;3 Stars cause the service was fine and my friend enjoyed her meal. I had an ahi tuna sandwich and it was extremely sloppy, and tasted more of sauce than of tuna. The fries also were really soggy and tasted kind of... old.Very odd experience.The waitress was super nice, but seemed extremely scatterbrained or distracted. I couldn't tell if she was the only one working, but she seemed a little frazzled. They need another waitress, or they need to offer the one they've got more breaks or training, or something.It was an OK place, but the food wasn't the best. I went late at night. Maybe the food's better in the daytime. Great vegetarian/vegan lunch buffet. So much variety, and all good quality. Will definitely be a frequent customer. Drinks are cheap, strong yet very well made. I will definitely go again and try their food. If you're looking for a strong happy hour drinks this is the place to go.
The atmosphere was lovely, the coffee was tasty and the food looked great. Seems like a great place to get some work done, no? No!Cafe Solstice does not offer wireless Internet access, ever.Maybe someone should warn them that they may be driven out of Seattle by a mob of angry netizens crazily waving laptop bags at them and chanting, "ubiquitous wireless now!" It would be ugly, and we don't want that. On dreary autumn days when I find myself wandering the U-District in between classes with a craving for grilled cheese and hot soup, I like to stop in at Cafe Solstice. Their lunch fare is a little pricey. $8 for a whole sandwich and bowl of soup, but the cheese is some of the gooiest I have encountered and tomato basil and split pea soups will both warm you up on a cold day.If you plan to stop by any time around normal lunching hours, be prepared to fight for a seat. Fortunately, I am usually flying solo and can take advantage of the stools at the counter. Plus, this lets me wistfully lust after the cute red head barista, Charlie Brown style. This is a hard review to write. I really really want to like solstice, they have some really great things going for them.1. Tasty homebaked goods2. Nummy granola (though the yogurt they carry is icky)3. Grilled Cheese sandwiches and they typically have tomato soup4. Other handmade pannini5. Tasty espresso drinks6. Handsome staff always willing to help. This is *the* independent coffeshop. I should be stopping in every morning on my way to work. I even bought a small prepaid coffee card from them. &#160;But here is the big problem preventing those two extra stars, and the problem that has me going to another coffee shop most every morning. There drip coffee has grounds in it. They actually do a french press instead of a typical drip. The coffee has a great flavor, but the little gritty bits at the bottom of &#160;the cup drive me crazy. I should be able to savor every drop of my $ 2.00 &#160;brewed coffee. And going later in the day you'll run the risk of getting the dregs of the drip. A cup at 11 am reveled itself to be a murky soup of coffee grounds in greyish water. Yum. GRRRREAT coffee.WWEEEEEEIRRRRD music.Hot baristas. My favorite coffee spot in the UD. &#160;Coffee is always excellent as well as the food. &#160;If you are in the mood for something sweet in the morning I recommend trying the blueberry cream cheese coffee cake. &#160;Overall a nice change of pace from the usual Starbuck's and Tully's shops that dominate the area. &#160;Check it out! The coffee is really good (albeit a bit pricey- $1.75 for a medium) and the cookies are addictive. I love the dark cozy atmosphere of the place and there is plenty of natural light from the skylights. The music is a bit loud at times but I find it helps drone out convo from other tables and keeps me focused on my readings for school.My one big complaint... horribly hours. Pretty much open only in the mornings and afternoons. But if you want a place to hang out b/t classes, its worth waiting in line for some coffee!Edit 1/25/08I upped my review from 4 to 5 stars. &#160;They have much better hours. &#160;And the coffee is still the best in the city!
After having spent a lifetime going to giant dim sum palaces in Southern California, I was ready to get all kinds of judgmental on whatever Seattle had to offer. Thankfully, my brother found this place and took us all here for a nice family breakfast on a Friday morning. At 10am the place was still doing pretty good business, but we got seated at a table right away (party of 6). I was a little bummed that it took so long for us to get tea, but the food did come around quickly and we had tons of options. We had a few people with special diets (dad can't eat shellfish and a friend who was veggie-only), but even they were able to find plenty of things to eat. The food cart ladies were a little bit aggressive but ultimately very helpful. At $12/person it was very affordable, and it was nice that it was close to the Light Rail station so we could walk there and back. The food was really good, and we all left happy! fast service, decent food. When my family and I went in, we were greeted and seated immediately. A cart full of dim sums came to our table. They even asked us for any special requests. Price is reasonable. One star off because of parking. You have to go there early to fight for parking spots.
The real deal in Salvadorean food! I should know because both of my parents are from El Salvador! xDThe pupusas are tasty (the only ones better than the ones here are my mom's) and their horchata is legit too - not Mexican-style with cinnamon, but with a cocoa base. Their pastries are amazing too! I took some home to share with my half-White, half-Asian hubby and like them too; we had the Mil Hojas - a bit different from what I'm used to but still good. I also got some pineapple-filled empanadas and an oreja - a flaky pastry that looks like an ear topped with Demerara sugar. Only reason I give this place a 4 b/c it's too far from me to go on a regular basis. I will definitely take my hubby to this place next time we're in that part of town! "Only one bite Cory, I swear," four bites later.That sweet, flaky pastry with the creamy coconut filling. One bite? Pshh...nothing could pry my hands away from that perfect, delicate Salvadorean treat. I LOVE this place! Ever since I moved from California I have looking for a great Salvadorian place, this hits the spot. From the baked goods to the food, I am a huge fan. They go above and beyond with customer sergice as well. Such nice people. if you don't have the time or the money to hop a plane to san salvador for some street food, come here. the owners are lovely people and their food is high quality and authentic.even if you are not well versed in latin american fare, don't feel intimidated!the menu is offered in english and spanish and they'll answer questions about anything you might not be familiar with.i've taken tons of friends here and none has been disappointed.even those who were reticent or had never eaten pupusas went away happy and wanting to return.i don't tend to eat anything out of the baked goods case but off the menu, i can vouch for plenty of it.de verdad, es comida rica preparada por buena gente. I love this place but my diet doesn't lol. I still try to make it in there atleast once a month. All the pastries, cakes are fresh and incredible. They sell the tres leches cake by the slice or the whole cake. There are so many things to try! I love the Jalapeno rolls with egg and cheese and the Tres Leches cake. The food is great too. Try the pupusas! Wow! Great soups. Ugly decor. Enjoy! I stopped in here with a coworker after doing a field work run in the area. &#160;I had one pollo y queso pupusa and two pastries: the pastelito de leche (custard) and pastelito de fresa (jam). &#160;First off, you have to keep in mind that this is an ethnic bakery, which means very reasonable prices! &#160;The pupusa was $2.50, and the pastelitos were $0.75 a piece, and so I had a breakfast come out to be just about $5 including tip.The pastelito de fresa was good--sweet and crumbly-- but nothing extraordinary or special. &#160;The pastelito de leche, on the other hand, had a much more decadent texture: sugar coated on the outside, and a nutty kind of creamy on the inside. &#160;Either way, both pastries are a steal.The pupusa was delicious. &#160;Slathering slaw on top with a good dose of hot sauce gives it a crunchy kick while you still have the savory filling of the pupusa itself blended in. &#160;I only ordered one, but at $2.50 a pop, ordering two or more would make an excellent and inexpensive meal. &#160;Other bits about the place: good customer service, the counter lady was very helpful and friendly; clean bathrooms, which might surprise you; overall, I would give it about 4.5 stars (just because the pastries weren't amazing), but I'll round it to a 5!
My favorite Thai restaurant in the U-District.Located a little off the Ave., Little Thai has awesome Thai food for a little cheaper than the rest of the U-District Thai places. &#160;The restaurant is set set below the street so it's quieter than most of the Ave. restaurants.Seating is open and plentiful (great for large groups) and the wait staff is very friendly and as I said earlier, the food is first-class. &#160;It tastes cleaner and healthier than most Thai places. &#160;Give Little Thai a shot!A+ I'm not sure why places just off the Ave tend to have slightly better than Ave-standard food. Perhaps because they can't rely on the flow of hungry college students to keep them in business, and actually have to earn some word-of-mouth recommendations. In any case, this place is slightly better than AppeThaigerRoom65.My most recent order was the spicy rice noodles with chicken. The vegetables were crisp and flavorful; the chicken actually tasted like chicken; the little leafy bits that might have been basil were little, leafy and possibly basilish. Add to that a large, varied menu and the fastest Thai kitchen on the Ave, and this place earns a respectable 4.125 stars.It loses 0.125 stars because the stairwell is mysteriously full of flies. Realized that other than their phad thai, nothing else really impressed me. Actually one time, i ordered something and it was SO BLAND i just decided to order a phad thai.i'll just be going to thaiger room. When I first started coming here, the food seemed pretty good. However, as time has progressed, their food has gotten more bland and less exciting. There is great customer service but I will have to eliminate 2 stars for boring food. Oh, and be careful if you're not a big pepper eater. If you tell the lady you want SPICY, like spicy-spicy, she'll make your ass burn. There is one thing I order here. &#160;It's the combo, medium spicy, which includes, Thai Curry Chicken, rice, and Tofu Phad Thai. &#160;At $7.50, it's an excellent value compared to other Thai restaurants such as Thai 65 or Appe Thai on the Ave. &#160;Sometimes the Phad Thai is on the colder side since they probably pre-prepare large quantities of it during the peak of the lunch hour, but if you go when it's less busy, you'll get a fresh batch.If you haven't been here, it's hidden in the basement of the light blue building just next to the Starbucks on 42nd, right off of the Ave.They add $.50 to Credit/Debit purchases, which is a bummer. We stopped in at Little Thai for lunch. &#160;It was nearby, and offered downstairs dining which made things a little quieter compared to the other Thai places directly on The Ave. &#160;As another reviewer mentioned, they'll give you two menus - they're roughly the same, though one has pictures on it. &#160;Good if you're new to the whole Thai cuisine thing. &#160;The variety is impressive, and you might feel a little intimidated about the more obscure dishes. &#160;Pad Thai is a safe bet here, though I opted for the Lunch Combo. &#160;The combination included a curry, a noddle dish, rice, and a spring roll with a little sweet sauce for $7.50 at the time of this writing. &#160;Though my Dad's Pad Thai was served hot, my curry and noodle dish were somewhat cold. &#160;I suspect they pre-prepare some of their more popular items before hand, so it might be a good idea to order a more obscure and adventuresome dish.The food was very good, and came in well sized portions. &#160;We definitely had left overs to bring home. &#160;The Thai Iced Tea is good, but tastes slightly less flavorful than other Thai places. &#160;The service was very friendly and cordial, always smiling. &#160;If you need to use the restroom ask for the key, which is attached to a massive ring, further weighted by a large piece of split bamboo. &#160;I think the idea is that you couldn't lose the thing if you tried. &#160;Chuck it into the Pacific and it'll float on the waves and find its way home. &#160;Then again, you're only walking down the hallway to the bathroom.By its subterranean nature, this is very much a "hole in the wall" and exactly the kind of cheap eating I like in the university environment. &#160;It's an out-of-the-way and cozy place with good food. &#160;The fish tank is pretty awesome too. This place had the fastest service for a Thai restaurant I've ever experienced. &#160;Our food came about 5 minutes after we sat down and ordered. &#160;The panang curry with vegetables was awesome. &#160;It had just the right amount of spiciness with a ton of rich panang curry flavor....yum! &#160;Their Thai iced tea was also good. &#160;Not too sweet but it had a little too much ice in it. &#160;The food is a little more expensive though. &#160;I ordered the larb gai here to-go once and it costs around $7 for it....considering it that it was a salad appetizer. &#160;Nonetheless it was still pretty good so I can't complain. &#160;Compared to most of the other Thai places on the Ave, this place is different where it gives you that homey feeling where they don't try to rush you. &#160;The service was excellent too. &#160;Definitely try this place out if you're tired of eating at the other Thai restaurants on the Ave. Food is ok- kinda bland and slightly greasy. &#160;Everything else about the restaurant is great- food comes out fast, reasonably priced, nice atmosphere... but all in all, not my number one choice for thai food. This place was quite interesting. Walked in and the place smelt like rotting fish, but one of my friends said that the food was some of the best they had ever tried - so I had to stick through it. We ordered chicken satay to start, and the meal came out on "grandmas china" which made me laugh, but the appetizer was pretty good. Unfortunately I can't say the same about the entree. I ordered panang curry and was disappointed by the overly watery curry like plate that was put in front of me. They only offered white rice, and the portion was quite small for the price of the meal. Don't expect to see me back here, unless I get drug their again. pretty bland and on the greasy side. &#160;Many other Thai places close to it that kick it's ass. &#160;This would be great in say Alabama. Have been there a bunch of times and love this place. &#160;I like the swimming rama with chicken 4 stars and I always ask for the wide noodles because they make a wicked good wide noodle. &#160;The BF likes the chicken noodle soup that I think is only listed on the specials board among other things as well. &#160;A MUST is the chicken satay the chciken is soooooo tender and the peanut sauce is wonderful. &#160;The price is right, the place is cozy and the staff is wonderful in everyway I can say. &#160;Most important they serve beer and wine. The owner lady is delightfully friendly and the service is astoundingly fast--today, my take-out lunch was ready in under five minutes! This family-run business is a true gem in a neighborhood overfilled with mediocre Thai restaurants. I loved going when I lived down the street from this place. &#160;It took me two years at UW to finally want to try and stop by this place. &#160;I love going here because it's quiet and also serves good Thai food. &#160;The staff is very friendly and I stopping by here for a quick lunch to-go. &#160;This place is usually pretty easy to get a table since they have a good amount of space in the restaurant. &#160;It can get pretty busy during the lunch hour, but that's really it. &#160;The Phad Thai is pretty good (not the BEST), but tasty enough that I'll come by for some.Stop by for a nice quiet meal when you don't want to bother will crowds of long waits! This is what I think is one of the best Thai restaurants in the U district, at least compared to Thai 65, Thaiger Room, Veggie Veggie, Appethai, and Thai Spice. &#160;We go there a lot, and enjoy the food every time! &#160;I've had better Thai but not around here. I'm conflicted about this place because sometimes it's good, and other times, not so much. I usually stick with the phad thai (sometimes dry and sometimes saucy) but totally deviated and ordered some egg rolls the other day. Bad move. They were large, but weirdly hard and semi-crispy. On the plus side, everyone that works there is friendly. I judge new Thai restaurants by their spicy green papaya salads.Damn, there's is spicy. Low-key place, reasonable prices.
Oh ya! Wow. This is my new spot for Ethiopian food.Tucked into the little strip mall next to Sam's Club off Aurora, its unassuming exterior prepares one for a pleasant surprise upon entering through the large wooden door. Intimate and cozy, with what looks like an Ethiopian living room across from the bar, it feels as if being ushered into someone's home. And the family there to greet you is so nice!We had the vegetarian combo, which had 7 different foods on it. Mysterious at first. Delicious to the end. The green bean dish was one of the best things I've ever tasted. My 4 year old agreed enthusiastically. It must have been fried, but it was so tender, lightly sweet and salty. I'm still craving it. We also had one of the lamb stews. It had a great flavor, but the lamb was a little tough and chewy. And the injeera (the spongy bread that comes with it) was a little on the sour side compared to other Ethiopian restaurants. Still, the vegetarian dishes were all a hit. If I didn't have so much left over in my fridge, I'd be going back today for more! Continuing the long-delayed review catchup..Definitely our favorite Ethiopian in Seattle, and as good as our local faves in San Francisco and New York.Food - classic, delicious, simple, nice variety, generous with the njera, across the board yummy for both meat and veg dishes.Service - friendly and basic. &#160; Only drawback is that if you're not familiar with Ethiopian food, I don't think you'll get an educational overview from the staff here, it's more like a (lovely) place for the local East African community.... so if you're a first-timer, come with friends who already love the food.Atmosphere - again, super simple tavern kind of feel with a mix of bric-a-brac and travel posters of beautiful children, it reminds me of (believe it or not) an Ethiopian restaurant in Arusha, Tanzania called "Ethiopian Spice House" -- which is spot on in my book. :)enjoy! The food and the atmosphere were wonderful. The service was great. You can really tell it's a family affair.Something quite funny took place while we were there. 3 of the people in our party ordered liquor drinks. 2 Vodka tonics and 1 gin &amp; tonic. The lady that took our order spoke such broken English (quite precious actually). When she brought out the drinks, she set down a pitcher of ice, a bottle of tonic water, and 3 rocks glasses full of liquor. It was obviously our turn to mix the drinks ourselves! It was actually quite awesome. Kind of like getting a bottle of wine delivered to the table, except it was liquor. The food was amazing. 1 large order filled up 4 people. Only turn off was the incense they lit half way through our meal. It smelled more like &#160;a cleaning solution than anything nice. Took us a few minutes to get past that and eat again, lol. 5 Stars for sure. This place is definitely worth your time and money!Plus, our server looked like that chick from Avatar. I came all the way from Palo Alto to try this place.Well, not really, but it is seriously good. Ethiopian is pretty new to me, but the veggie combo platter was delicious. The injara was good too. Plenty of food to share with a companion, or pack the rest for lunch. The place has a very comfy hole-in-the-wall vibe.I shall be back. We second the opinion on the Veggie Combo, wonderful spices &amp; flavors.The 'Teff' is used to eat with, it's a fantastic grain, like nan or a tortilla. The food is natural, organic, and the plates are huge. We'll be going back and sharing this place! Wonderful, friendly service,comfortable, a unique and fun experience. This is some of the best Ethopian food in town. &#160;We always order the Vegetarian and Meat combo and have been very happy with all the dishes. &#160;The owner and staff are exceedingly friendly. &#160;The atmosphere is very inviting even though it is stuck in the back of a minimall. &#160;Even our skeptical 13 year old is a fan.We will be back! This is a great mom and pop place and a completely hole in the wall. The food is absolutely delicious. I love the decor and the lighting makes it very homey on the inside. I am surprised that the place was not packed.The service was super nice, friendly, and attentive even after we finished our dinner. My friend actually forgot her scarf and they chased us down just to give it back.This is now my favorite place for Ethiopian food and I would definitely come back again. You gotta love an ethnic restaurant that is full of natives. That says it all. &#160;The atmosphere is clean and simple, yet intriguing. &#160;The waitresses are helpful, and the food is well worth the price and a bit of a wait.We try to order sparingly, though, because we find that leftovers are not easy to reheat to our satisfaction. I really enjoyed this place. I came Saturday afternoon, which is when they do their ethiopian coffee ceremonies. They roast raw coffee beans on the spot for the coffee and it's free! Me and a friend ordered the meat combination plate. The food was very yummy and unique and was a bargain at $15. There was more than enough food to feed 3 people.The place is extremely well decorated and the staff is super friendly. A total gem of a restaurant. Don't let the outside appearance of this restaurant fool you. Step inside and you will be transported to an exotic atmosphere. I went here last Saturday night for dinner and sat towards the back where actual Ethiopian customers were leisurely enjoying their dinner, relaxing with friends, all the while watching a muted soccer game on the flat screen. The service was wonderful. I felt taken care of. The food was comparable to other Ethiopian places on capital hill, very flavorful and aromatic. I highly recommend this place for an interesting date night or when you feel like eating with your fingers and want something out of the ordinary. Excellent food! This was my first time trying Ethiopian food and it was a great experience and very good food. The waitress was very friendly and attentive, she answered all of our questions and even told us about each thing we ordered. We had the Veggie and Meat Combo plates, which was enough for all five of us to be comfortably full. We did order drinks as well, we had bottle of Chateau St. Michelle that was not marked up at all ($18.00) and also had one of the Ethiopian beers, which was interesting.All and all a great experience, nice music, great friendly service, and good food! The food is amazing. &#160;Friday night, not crowded, no wait, and the food was amazing. &#160;The injera was perfect, sour, tasty. &#160;From the reviews I expected really good food, and I was still surprised. &#160;Wow. &#160;I'll go back. Love that veggie combo! &#160;The restaurant is clean, the people are very nice. Okay we've been back to Gojo a bunch of times since my last review and it just keeps getting better and better. &#160;It has now become our "go to" place when guests come to town for a fun, unique dinner out. &#160;By the way Ethiopian food is gluten free. &#160;We have a daughter who has a gluten intolerance and the Teff grain used for the injera is okay for her. &#160;So that's another plus. Very, very good food. My husband and I ordered the veggie combo platter and the ZillZill beef tibs and it was absolutely delicious! At $12 ea. we had more than enough to take home a full to go box after eating until we were stuffed. Make sure to order the spicy tea as well, goes great with the food!We walked in on a week night, no need for a reservation. Service was excellent. Ambience was OK, I wish there was more music. I liked this place. I would consider myself an Ethiopian cuisine enthusiast. I normally order the veggie platter and have been looking through out Seattle for a favorite one. &#160;So far I have not found one that fits all of my criteria but Gojo came close. I find the atmosphere to be nice compared to other Ethiopian restaurants. I ordered to go since I was in a hurry, the staff was friendly and accommodating. I enjoyed my food, the collard greens are by far my fav. in Seattle. I liked the green bean dish, I had not tried it before. I loved my salad, I feel like I never even get salad at most of the places I visit. Only thing I was discouraged about was the cabbage and carrot dish. I was no impressed. I almost avoided it the whole time I was grubbing. I would return for sure. I live in Ballard but its on my way home and worth hitting up instead of driving to the CD. If I wanted to make an evening out of getting Ethopian food with friends I would come here as a first option due to the atmosphere. Thanks Gojo! Best north end Ethiopian food. I am so happy to have found them again. They used to have a place down where the Target is now in Northgate. Found them the first time by asking cabbies where the best foods was. They have an excellent berbere. I usually have the veggi combo and lamb wat. Very good food and friendly staff. We've been dining at Gojo since shortly after they opened. &#160;No matter how busy they are, the cuisine is consistently delicious, with fresh ingredients and terrific spices. &#160;It seems every table is enjoying the company of the people they are with as well as good food. In all the times we've eaten there, we've never been disturbed by loud patrons at another table. The family that runs Gojo are always warm and happy to see you, which imparts a gracious, polite manner among the diners which is not always easy to find in good Seattle restaurants. &#160;We always order the assorted vegetarian platter and a meat entree. Very good, the vegetarian platter is well done. After living in Ethiopia for the past year, I am a bit skeptical of many Ethiopian restaurants here in the states. This place blew away my concerns. It was great - authentic Injera that was the perfect consistency and sourness, delicious doro wat, flavorful kitfo. The owner sat with us for upwards of 30 minutes while we drank tej (honey wine) and told stories of Ethiopia. Doesn't get much better than that! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants authentic Ethiopian! I have loved Ethiopian food for years and I am so happy that Gojo is located in the north end of town close to where I live. This is a family business and the people are warm and friendly and the food is fabulous. They make the best Doro Wat that I have ever had even though my favorite dish is the vegetable combo. I need to ask Marta how she makes her green bean dish because it is the best I have ever eaten! I have brought many friends to Gojo and they have all loved the food and the experience. 3 months after our 1st visit, this is still a wonderful cultural and epicurean experience. &#160;We have always eaten in the evening and have never been &#160;disappointed. &#160;The daily-made sauces with spices sent from Ethiopia give a bright and varied character to all the creations. &#160;The injera bread is created from naturally fermented Teff-rich flour and takes 3 days to create. &#160;It may be too sour for some, but we find it a perfect complement for the various dishes, &#160;spicy or mild. &#160;A homey, family-run restaurant with a cultural authenticity that attracts many local Ethiopian patrons and families. &#160;One of my favorite dining experiences, and extremely economical.
As my sister so eloquently put it, "El Gaucho is not a restaurant, it is a dining experience." The restaurant has the feel of an exclusive supper club out of the 1920s or 30s. The dining room is decked out in mahogany and dark leather with mood lighting to match. While this means it can occasionally be hard to see your food, it also means you don't have to look at the ridiculous gaucho jackets they make the servers wear. Seriously, the name is enough. We get it.While the servers attire is a bit eccentric, the food is absolutely top-notch. Granted, the top-notch quality comes with top-notch prices. I paid $60 for my steak, but what a steak it was! El Gaucho does not suffer from the presentation over substance curse of other upscale dining establishments. Their food is straightforward like a slab of beef to the face.I started my meal with the Gaucho salad, which was ample and covered in juicy cocktail shrimp. The salad was basic, high quality greens, dressing and shrimp piled high.I ordered the New York peppercorn steak as my main course. Many of the steaks at El Gaucho can be ordered in a variety of sizes. The peppercorn however comes only as a massive 16 oz cut encrusted in black pepper and served in nothing but its juices. Side dishes are served family style at El Gaucho. We ordered two helpings of asparagus, an order of mashed potatoes and the mushroom risotto. The asparagus was delicate and steamed to perfection with just the right amount of crunch. The mashed potatoes were unremarkable, but they were the cheapest side on the menu at only $5. The risotto drop kicked the Flying Fish's risotto in the face and ran off with its girlfriend. It was flavorful and rich without being overbearing and the grains of rice retained their firm texture while still blending nicely with the sauce.For desert, my mother and sister ordered Bananas Foster, which came with a flaming floor show (meaning fire, not geigh). I had the chocolate bourbon cake. The cake was fluffy and moist... like the inside of a baby bunny if it were made of chocolate cake.In the end, our meal came to a little over $100 per person, but every once in a while you just need to blow a wad on a giant hunk of meaty goodness.P.S. I ate about half of the peppercorn steak at the restaurant and had the BEST grilled steak and cheese sandwich today with the leftovers. Been here twice, and what can I say? Fantastic porterhouse! But that is not what makes this place stand out from other steakhouses. What really stood out for me was the Caeser salad. A real one as a matter of fact. They make it right in front of you, even mince the anchovies there. I do not eat seafood, and cringe just thinking about anchovies, but you can not taste them at all in the salad. Wonderful! Also loved the ambiance of the place.Rock! Swankiest club in town; a fantastic little hide-away under the infamous El Gouge-O. Prepare to be taken back to the 50's when adult entertainment didn't mean barely legal girls performing yoga like manuevers with breasts even God wouldn't take credit for. By all means, I'm not condemning these acts but there's a time and a place for these.. namely my bedroom.. but I digress.Fridays and Saturdays are decorated with a wonderful jazz quartet, a dance floor, tables and bar for your night out on the town. Forget the bass thumping and gyrating hips, leave that to the dozen or so, dime-a-dozen nightclubs in the area and actually enjoy your company with non-screaming conversation, good wine and good food. Take your date here and you'll stand out from the crowd; ask her to dance and she'll melt like butter. I sometimes like beef but I can't order it at el gaucho. &#160;Why? &#160;Because I can't stand to see pink in the middle! &#160;Its my weird thing where I only eat meat if it has been charred to perfection. &#160;Of course the staff can't stand these kind of requests so I make it easy on them and just order side dishes. &#160; Other than beef (which I hear is amazing) they don't offer too many other options. &#160;(Oh did I forget to mention I don't eat seafood? &#160;Fellow diners love eating with me.) &#160;I usually order the french onion soup, a delightful tureen of cheese and salty broth. &#160;Mmm! &#160;Also, their table side salads are pretty good but often heavy on the dressing. &#160;The potato dishes are OK. &#160;I also hear the bananas foster is A++ but I don't really like mushy bananas. &#160;My favorite part is the complimentary fruit tower at the end. &#160;I don't know why but free food ALWAYS tastes delicious. Once again, here is a place with lots of good reviews that are well deserved. The food is amazing. The service is amazing. The price is super high, but you get what you pay for most of the time. Here as some of the thinks I like about El Gaucho that may be a little different from other reviews:1. The bar. The drinks are of course too expensive but its a great place for people watching. From the posers to the pretenders there is always something worth looking at. 2. The piano. There is a piano in the bar and most nights someone playing it. He takes requests and is quite good. 3. Bathroom Sherpa. I know someone else mentioned it, but its so cool to have your own personal bathroom Sherpa. 4. If you don't order dessert they bring a huge basket of nuts, cheese and fruit to your table. (When I say huge, I mean thanksgiving at Grandma's house huge nut bowl...) Fantastic food. Fantastic service (even tho the guy appearing out of nowhere to escort me to the bathroom totally freaked me out). Very patient staff. The baseball cut steak was amazing, as were the wine and the nuts &amp; fruits.The atmosphere in the restaurant is cozy, very swanky. It's a fun way to spend lots of hard-earned dollars. Two words - hell yes! "ai" What an amazing dining experience - from the flambes to the waiters who rush to pull your chair out and escort you to the bathroom to the delicious steak to the 1920's feel to the grand wine selection - it's worth the splurge! Steak &amp; Seafood isn't really my thing, so I'm not much a fan of the restaurant, but the bar is great. &#160;Get the crab cakes and your favorite drink (quality scotch selection) and relax. &#160;Just don't sit too close to the piano. Utter decadence. This is not a restaurant, it's an event place. Opulent, dark surroundings, fancy digs and impeccable service. Apparently this is THE place in Seattle to see and be seen, spend an outrageous amount of money. Yes, that does say $120 for a Chateaubriand for two, and $84 for a New York Steak. The flaming, prepared at your table lamb brochettes are probably to die for --and indeed, that is quite a flame they make for you. Fanciest menu I've seen in many years. We decided that instead of forking over what could easily have been $500 for the four of us (including wine but not, of course, the $1995 Bordeaux), we went for the very satisfying appetizers and sides. Diablo shrimp, exquisite crab cakes, fresh clams, baby back beef ribs, scalloped potatoes, Caesar salad made to order, roasted corn. Amazing all around. Perhaps next time we'll go for the lamb chops or enormous Porterhouse, but frankly we also thought that the portions must be Flintstone-size as well. Yet that would, possibly, rationalize the price. Or not. Who comes here? People with 6 or 7 figure incomes. Your engagement announcement date. Where you propose. Where you take your boss to impress him/her. No wait, you are taken and someone else pays. One fault: we didn't see a dessert menu; instead we were given a fresh fruit, date and cheese (Stilton) tray. Yet if you've just ingested a 28-oz steak that costs the same as a full tank of gas, do you really need a chocolate souffle? Five stars hands down. Bring your financial portfolio before ordering that Bordeaux. was here the other night for dinne and had a blast..the food was awesome..(potatoes were to spicy for me though ) would give it 4.5 if i could but was a great time then went to the pampas room for drinks around the corner the blueberry martini is great but you dont taste the alcohol and you tend to drink them to fast..
Sure it's a little divey, a little dingy, but the beer glasses are clean and that's what matters. After all, the place is called Ed's Kort Haus (i.e. not German, just purposefully misspelled), so you have fair warning.The selection of draft beers here is pretty extensive (~20) and mostly local. They're often served with a smile by Ed himself, and they won't set you back like those pricey Belltown alcohol boutiques.If you're like me and always appreciate a good dive, you've already been here or are now planning your visit. If not, I'd at least recommend stopping by for a beer next time you feel like slumming or doing a Phinney/Greenwood pub crawl. Not a bad place to get a beer... if you really, really need one. &#160;I'm hoping the alcohol in my cup killed whatever wasn't cleaned off of it. &#160;The bar staff was attentive to my party of 5 and made sure we were happy with the level of beer left in our pitcher. &#160;So that was good.There are pool tables and arcade style games and food... none of which I tried so I can't comment on those. &#160;For bar atmosphere, however, this place seems like a good place to watch a game or get a beer with good friends. &#160;Just wipe down your cup before using it if you get a chance. Good selection of beers on tap and the craziest hamburger selections I've ever seen. &#160;I didn't notice the "exotic" list until I had already ordered but I'm definitely going back to try a yak burger or maybe a camel burger. &#160;The bar itself feels like a bit of a dive (which I prefer honestly) with pool tables in the back and at least one Big Buck Hunter game that looked kinda complicated. &#160;The staff was friendly and efficient and I'd like to frequent this place more often.
The Daily Grill is one of the only options near ACT Theatre, so there's not much to compete with for pre-show business. They treat their patrons well - knowing that a curtain time is on the mind and they reward you with a dining discount if you mention the theatre by name. Nice touch! Happy Hour is great - get there early and snag a spot by the fireplace on the couches.The food is fairly standard - a big selection of meaty entrees or seafood. We typically share salads and some apps of hummus, calamari, seared tuna and of course, some dirty martinis. The service is always very nice and prompt. They even saved my wallet once that I'd left on the couch. I can't even begin to count how many meals I've eaten at the Daily Grill during my last two trips to Seattle. They're really great about my food allergies and even when the service is slow they're great about apologizing or putting a rush on things to help get you moving.When I'm away from home and staying in Seattle, the Daily Grill is almost like my security blanket. I eat tons and tons of steamed spinach, hummus, and avocado sandwiches and generally find myself gravitating towards them for meetings with colleagues - especially in the morning.They have amazing orange juice and fantastic coffee. I also have always appreciated that despite our crew looking a bit "unconventional' due to the type of work we do, the staff have never been rude or standoffish with us. I really feel like, especially during PAX, it's a 'come as you are' type of place. I was at a conference at the Convention Center and a group of my friends/colleagues decided to come here for lunch since we'd never tried it before.I ordered the salad and pasta...basically half an order of house salad and half an order of angel hair pasta. &#160;It wasn't bad, but it wasn't outstanding either. &#160;The pasta was tasty, albeit a bit oily. &#160;The strawberry lemonade was refreshing.It's not somewhere I would come often, but they were good about getting us in and out so we could make it back to our conference and I appreciate that. If it wasn't for the bitchy attitude of our waiter I would probably give this place a three stars, but (whatever his name was) ruined it. Came here for breakfast after walking around half of the city looking for a decent place to have breakfast and none was found; we decide to try the hotel restaurant; which food wise wasn't all bad, it was the server's attitude that really bothers me. I've been criticized for not being nice something after waiting longer than 20 minutes for the waiter to come to our table and take our order; but the fact that he came and took the order of our next table who arrived just five minutes prior was what really put me in a bad mood. When he finally decided to come to our table and asked us for something to drink we gave him our drinks order and told him that we were ready with our food order as well; that's when he snapped and told us that he will get it when he was done with our drinks. I'm not complaining about what he said; but the way he said... Since Seattle don't have that many breakfast places, this place probably will be filled with all the people who don't know the city or are too busy to get out of the hotel; but I learned my lesson and the best is to walk the streets before getting another bitchy, unhappy waiter. For overpriced hotel restaurant food, it was better than I expected. &#160;The Kobe burger of the day was ridiculously messy and impossible to handle. &#160;It was more medium rare than it was medium, but still pretty good. &#160;The macaroni and cheese that came on the side was my favorite part of the meal. &#160;Simple shells but with tasty breadcrumbs baked on top.Service was unremarkable, but not rude. &#160;After a long weekend of wandering around the convention center across the street, I may go back next PAX out of sheer laziness. I sit at the bar and have wine and salad fairly often since it's close to work and home. I am in love with the endive salad and could probably eat one every single day! This is a great place to talk to strangers. I know I'm not supposed to but I like to live on the edge. It's a hotel bar, for goodness sake! Strangers are there! About a week and a half back, The Boy and I tried finding a new place to eat downtown. We were going to try Bambuza (still are) but alas, as we walked up to the door, the wait staff informed us that their main chef had fallen ill. Bummer. So we walked a block down to the corner where the Cheesecake Factory faces off against the Daily Grill, and decided to give the Daily Grill a shot. (My Yelp friends know my new Cheesecake Factory policy: Only the cheesecake, never for a meal.)The Daily Grill is a nice little joint, but at the time we went, curiously empty. Our waitress was very solid--never intruding when we had full mouths, always keeping me in water, a nice mix brisk and friendly without being too fake. Very professional. The service was prompt, and the atmosphere nice and calm, although it felt slightly dated by a few years. (No biggie for me, mind you. While I dig the hip new thang vibe some places cultivate, a little age can mellow a place out.)The food was excellent, although I was sadly bereft of the butternut squash soup on the menu. I settled for a salad to go along with my steak. The salad was...ok...I guess? I don't quite recall. Certainly nothing that made me sit up and take notice. The steak was excellent, although I decided I wasn't really keen on the bordelaise sauce they served with it. And then there were the potatoes.These potatoes really should have been awesome. They were skins-on red potatoes mashed to near creamy perfection...but for some reason, the chef had seen fit to add wilted spinach to them. Not chopped spinach, mind you, but whole limp leafs of spinach, wiggling their way through my otherwise divine potatoes like eels. It's not the taste, mind you. Chopped spinach would have been fine. But I kept choking on the extraordinarily long leaves as I tried to chew and swallow the potatoes. I don't know if eating mashed potatoes should be this exhausting.The Boy took pity on me and let me eat his potatoes, which were for some mysterious reason, perfectly free from spinach. We finished off our meal with a yummy brownie-and-ice-cream sort of dessert. And I'll admit that was pretty delish.But the food felt just a tad bit pricey for the quality. I've had more memorable meals at similar prices. I would certainly give the Daily Grill another chance at securing a fourth star, particularly since so many things about the service and ambience were good. Just....you know....leave the spinach out of the mashed potatoes. Really. Lets face it...there are not that many options in downtown Seattle for breakfast, very strange.Came in for breakfast as we were staying in the hotel already. I had the blueberry pancakes and they were a-ok, nothing out of this world - expected. It is rare for a place to make breakfast stand out. The food tasted just like anywhere else I had pancakes, no ill to them really.The only negative was our waiter. I am not sure if if he was having a bad morning or his tone, that sounded very rude, was just his demeanor. Anyways, we were ready to order and we told him and he was not really in the mood to take the food order. He interrupted us and said 'and what would you like to drink'. Again, not in what he said but the way he delivered it, we both look at each other and were like..what a jerk. I actually liked this place. I work right across the street and was put off by it at first thinking it was just some old hotel restaurant. Have been there a couple times for lunch and have been pleasantly surprised each time. After the last time last week, I decided to write it up. After a horrifying time at Palamino, the hostess refused to seat us after we told her we had a gift card. She looked us square in the eyes and with a fake smile said "I'm sorry we are booked solid with reservations. We are not sitting for lunch" Since when? Anywhos, we decided to take our office girls lunch somewhere else. So we went into the Daily Grill with our heads hung. The waitress was nice and awesome. I ordered the salad and pasta plate and it was so good. I wanted to lick the sun-dried tomato and olive oil coated bowl when I was done. Do not underestimate this place just below the Sheraton Seattle. I enjoyed my meal, but the food was pretty generic. The staff made a few mistakes, but it was a busy time so maybe they were unprepared. Stopped off at the Daily Grill for dinner after work with some friends. The food ranged from lackluster to downright miserable. One example was a person from our party who ordered a pasta dish which literally was nothing more than box pasta and jar sauce. Oh, and did I mention that this dish cost $14? Serving items like this to your guests and at those prices is just down right insulting.Anyway, the place clearly caters to the business traveler who typically doesn't care much about the quality of their food and is on a daily stipend so also won't care about spending someone else's money on a poor meal. Considering all of the other great places to eat just minutes away downtown, I cannot fathom why people continue to endure this place -- it's like a bad Friday's trip that costs 3 times as much. My friend and I stayed at the Sheraton and was hungover one day and really didn't feel like walking elsewhere. We entered from the hotel and found it fairly confusing because the host said "I'll meet you at the front" I personally thought that the entrance from the hotel was the "front" but apparently it was the back?! Well we got seated, I got the smoked salmon benedict. well i thought it could have been better. I thought it was a bit over priced. As for service, the only thing i have to say is the attentiveness was a little lacking. Maybe because we came during shift change but there were hardly anyone on the floor. Although when I asked for a few things they were brought to me promptly. I wouldn't eat here again even if I stay at Sheraton just because I feel like prices else where are more reasonable and taste better. On the way to a sold out movie we didn't get tickets to beforehand is what brought us to the Daily Grill. &#160;In case you didn't know - Daily Grill is right across the street from Regal Cinema's downtown...so that made this choice quite appealing. We sat in the bar area. Luckily we could find seats with it being late night. &#160;Luckier still the Daily Grill has a late night happy hour. &#160;In case you don't know (which you probably have no idea) I live for happy hour so this made the Daily Grill all the more appealing. This seems like a place trying to be fancy, but it's not so fancy that you can't wear a backwards ball cap - I wasn't the only one. &#160;It connects to a hotel so that's probably why it has an upscale feel.Place was clean with no problems getting a seat. &#160;The Happy Hour menu really wasn't all that, but the entire happy hour menu was reasonably priced. &#160;The chicken meatballs were good and different with excellent marinara sauce. &#160;The sashimi that was ordered was just okay, but then this place isn't trying to be Mashiko's and the person ordering should have known that beforehand anyway. &#160;Questionably, the only beer on the happy hour list was Miller (MGD or Light) I can't remember...It did go good with the meatballs though...Pros: Location (across from theatre), late hour happy hour (after 9p), service was good.Cons: Happy hour menu left something to be desired, one beer on happy hour list?? The place was fairly dead on a Friday night so we had the full attention of the staff. &#160;Our waiter was super attentive and friendly, offering recommendations and fulfilling our every wish. &#160;I had a cobb salad which was like every cobb salad that I ever had but my date had the filet mignon which he was drulling over. &#160;The mashed potates had too much spinach for my taste but were fairly good. &#160;We had creme brulee which was good. &#160;They have this great dinner special there which includes a salad, an entree and wine or dessert for like $30 which is a great deal. &#160;Recommended! Since it's so close to my office as in right across the street, I tend to go here a lot. &#160;Great for business lunches in my opinion - good selection of salads, sandwiches, and entrees. &#160;I think their Cobb Salad is one of the best, and their Chicken Pot Pie is amazing. &#160;Huge portions. &#160;I had their Brownie Pie two days in a row, which was probably a mistake calorie-wise, but my palate out-voted my cholesterol level and I went for it. First of all their food is really good. I had some great beef casadias. The waiter was nice and kept on bring us drink refills. The prices are ok for downtown.But, the service is slow... I guess this place is more like a restaurant so slow service is required. Don't expect anything other than Americana food like sandwiches, pasta, and burgers. After standing around all day across the street at the Convention Center, my coworkers and I wanted to grab some food and to watch the Game 6 of the Lakers VS Celtics game. &#160;Saw that Daily Grill had TV in their bar area so decided to grab food there.We got seated at the section to the left since the TV there had the volume up. &#160;After looking through the menu, I ended up getting the Pepper Bacon Burger. &#160;Great beef patty with a thick layer of cheddar cheese. &#160;I was expecting the burger to be a lot more peppery but since it had peppered bacon but its more like bacon bits with cracked black pepper and then sprinkled on. &#160;The 1000 Island sauce that came on the burger was good though, and they even give you a little on the side for the onion rings that it comes with. &#160;Not a top burger, but pretty solid.I saw my coworkers entrees and none really appealed to me except for the Pot Pie. &#160;It came with this gigantic crust and when you break it open, you see a little plate with the pot pie in it. &#160;I personally love the crusts so I wouldn't mind trying that next time.The whole feel of Daily Grill is pretty good. &#160;Dark wood and dim accent lighting dominates the whole restaurant. &#160;There's also couches around the bar area. &#160;Pretty nice spot to unwind after a long day but the food is what you come to expect from a "higher end" chain restaurant! Good restaurant! Definitely not what you expect to find right under &#160;hotel... I would definitely go there again. I think that decor and use of space are just as important as service and quality and presentation of food, don't you? The Daily Grill manages to do both very well. Even though, at first glance, the shear size of the restaurant may be overwhelming and to some, unwelcoming however, once you make your way across the walnut floors to the matching and huge bar, that apprehension you had begins to fade away. First and foremost, if I drank martini's, I am sure I would be very impressed with theirs. There is a secret and constant on going war in the bar world but, I have heard they are done to perfection here. The location of the grill cannot be beat since it is across the street from The Regal Theaters and Gameworks. However, lets talk more of the space. There are several very intimate places to sit if you do not get an actual table. Both of which are kind of like sitting on your very own leather couch at home. One of which sits in front of this huge window that I think if you stay there long enough, you could watch the city pass by. The happy hour is not only happy but a very pleasant surprise since it starts at a very late hour on a Saturday night. That came in very handy this weekend while I was on my way to check out SALT at the Regal. I had the calamari and the seared Ahi tuna which I can safely say, you MUST try. My server was less than prompt, unfortunately but not totally terrible. Or at least so bad that it would affect my review of the place. I hope to chalk it up to the distance she had to travel. Overall, combining the happy hour, the dinner menu prices, the location and the decor I can safely recommend for casual dressy to first date type places to go, The Daily Grill HAS THE GOODS. The happy hour calamari is a great value and very, very tender. &#160;The chicken pot pie, though an unusual offering as a happy hour item, was deeeelicious. &#160;I'm glad I stopped in.
We had d-list reservations at 5:30 - there were four of us...since we had such early rezzies I figured we'd be able to sit and eat and drink til our hearts content...well, after ordering plenty of hors d'oeuvres, triple order of oysters...four bottles of wine and after dinner drinks, they politely kicked us out at 8:15 stating that there was a max time patrons could stay...how very un-French, but I get it... we were totally d-list after all.. i would probably go to Place Pigalle instead for dinner and leave Le Pichet for sipping coffee (within the time limit of course). The front door got me. &#160;It made me feel like I was a 94 year old grandmother saying: "Help me, sonny!" trying to get in the door. &#160;Not very nice to do to someone before they're about to hit a milestone birthday... *sigh* &#160;It's just not fair.Trying to read the menu on the wall was frustrating trying to decipher everything (especially when you're fighting off pain), but fortunately our lovely waitress pointed out that the menu is also in English. &#160;Sweeeeeet.The baguette was pretty standard fare. &#160;Kudos for bringing it with butter that isn't in a cold state! &#160;That's definitely one of my pet peeves when restaurants do that. &#160;Yes, it's so cute and pretty shaped like a little rose, but geez, I can't do anything with it when it's practically frozen solid!I ordered the Les tartines with the Zoe's meats Salami. &#160;It was pretty tasty. &#160;I did a quick google search with my phone to find out that cornichons means gherkin. &#160;Good to know! &#160;I ended up slicing up the little pickle and putting it on my sandwich. &#160;I also used both mustards on it. &#160;It was delicious! &#160;I just wish it had more salami or thicker sliced salami.Now for the G&#226;teau au foie de volaille.... &#160;Oh man. &#160;Um... Well, it *is* on "the list"... &#160;Before I saw the translation, I knew it was going to be something involving chicken liver. &#160;I tempered my expectations. &#160;Let's face it folks, when it comes to chicken liver or liver in general, you either love the stuff or you hate it. &#160;I'm of the latter group. &#160;My mom made liver and onions once for dinner, and nobody in the family would eat it. &#160;That night she tossed it in with a bunch of other meats and foods as leftovers for our dog, and the next morning the liver was still sitting there in her bowl. &#160;That's right, my DOG wouldn't even eat liver. &#160;What can I say, folks? &#160;Collies are smart creatures.Back to the G&#226;teau au foie de volaille. &#160;What is it? &#160;It's a chicken liver terrine. &#160;What is a terrine? &#160;It's a chilled "meat"loaf. &#160;It's served at room temperature or cold. &#160;I say "meat"loaf with quotations because you can make a terrine without meat (i.e. cranberry terrine - delicious!). &#160;So, I took a bite of this incredibly unappetizing looking dish. &#160;I will say this one thing about the dish: it wasn't nearly as bad as I had built it up to be in my mind. &#160;Before the whole dining experience was over I had taken 2 (very) small bites of it. &#160;The second bite was slightly better than the first bite, and this only confirmed my stance that liver is an acquired taste. &#160;If you like liver, absolutely try this dish.Service was prompt and friendly. &#160;To their credit, our waitress took the G&#226;teau au foie de volaille off our bill since we didn't like it. &#160;It was pretty obvious we didn't like it since there were only about 3 teeeeeensy little half-fork bites missing from it. &#160;We told her it was okay since we knew we probably wouldn't like it, but she said they had a policy to remove anything from the bill if the customers didn't like it. &#160;So that was very nice of them.The prices were reasonable, and the overall flair of the place was nice. &#160;Their attention to detail was appreciated. &#160;The dessert menu sounded delicious, but we didn't order dessert this time. &#160;Maybe next time! I love this little cafe. It makes my French-food and cured-meat loving heart smile. You're a vegetarian, you say? Keep on looking, then, because the only thing you're going to be able to eat here is a baguette. Move along, 'cause it means more room for me! :) &#160;I've been here for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and all manner of snackage in between and have never been disappointed. You must try the cod filet, which is braised and served in a cream sauce with clams and cauliflower. The fish is buttery and flakes perfectly. And I love the accompanying shoestring potatoes! They're like a fancy version of Pik-Nik chips. I also love coming here with friends and sharing charcuterie and cheese boards -- there's always a tasty selection. Cocktails are great here, too. Try the French 75, or if you prefer something stronger, the Poire (made with pear brandy, Cointreau, and some other stuff, served in a martini glass with a sugared rim. Too strong for me to finish, but still very tasty!). Le Pichet isn't really big enough for large groups, but it's a good place to meet for a couples' double date or a casual dinner for two. The servers, though slightly distant, are polite -- and last night, when husband and I were dining outside and the temperature dropped, the server lent my chilly hubby a jacket. That definitely upped their cool points in my book. &#160;I will definitely miss this place when I leave Seattle! Am I back in Paris? Sure felt like it. Doing French right. I LOVE the charm of this place. Heard so much about their french onion soup which was the reason I had to come in. Don't leave without trying it!! My best friend and I went to pike place early last sunday to enjoy the nice weather. We were walking around and couldn't decide where to grab a bite to eat for lunch. We then stumbled upon Le Pichet. There were two couples and an old lady enjoying their croissants and coffee at the tables outside. It looked very Parisian. All of the people who know me know how much I love Paris. Therefore, this place caught my eye instantly.We were lucky that when we arrived, a couple was just leaving. We were able to snag a great table right next to the sidewalk so that we could people watch while we ate. We ordered the green salad with hazelnuts topped with mustard dressing. Took me back to the sidewalk cafe right next to my apartment in Paris.For our main dishes I ordered a paris ham and gruyere baguette and frites. The bread was great and the fries were perfection. Had an awesome cup of cafe au lait to finish off my meal. &#160;Le Pichet left me satisfied. Eating at Le Pichet made me wonder why I hadn't discovered it earlier. I loved the cozy French bistro atmosphere. Little touches, such as the word "Reserved" (well, in French) written on our table with chalk in a flourish of cursive, made me smile. I had the following:* oysters on the half shell* red wine braised beef cheeks baked in a shepherd's pie with chard, potato puree, and cheese* honey tangerine sorbetThe beef cheeks were well-flavored, hearty, homey, and simple. I found the portion size just right. The sorbet had the wholesome texture of homemade sorbet and was bursting with flavor. It made me crave sorbet for days to follow.My only complaint is that Le Pichet is a bit too cozy. Although I was pressed up against the table, everyone who walked by bumped against the back of my chair, constantly interrupting my enjoyment of the food. Avoid the tables near the bathroom and kitchen if you can. A small and "home feel" like cafe. &#160;I had the Eufs plats, jambon et fromage for my 28th birthday breakfast. &#160;It was sausage bits. &#160;:) &#160;Delicious. &#160;I also love the freshly squeezed orange juice (I LOVE PULP). &#160;Staff was nice and friendly.The cool part about this place was the table is a chalkboard that you can write on. &#160;Just ask for chalk! &#160;Check out pictures posted...Love it! I haven't been to France and I've only driven through it's Canadian cousin, Quebec, but this place has to be one of the most authentic French bistros in my limited experience.The beer was cold, the cheese was excellent, and the charcuterie plate was delicious. As it was the middle of a work day we had the place to ourselves which was just fine with us and the laid back staff.Le Pichet a &#233;t&#233; un grand Belltown trouver et nous allons revenir la prochaine fois que nous sommes dans le quartier. Stuck to the cheese platter and smoked salmon- overall excellent, and despite smaller portions, was totally filling for two people.For those of you who had a bad service experience- the place is tiny, and densely populated at dinnertime. He may be right next to you physically, but will be servicing eight other diners in an area the size of a New York Apartment. The jambon and fromage is freaking awesome. Perfectly baked eggs. Delicious! The live music was also really nice. The server forgot about me but it's French service I suppose. All in all a great experience. I'm coming back for the cheese plate! Le Pichet is a great casual French restaurant in a tiny space so you may want to consider making reservations. The charcuterie plate was excellent, the bread was tasty, &#160;the martini's were perfect and even waiting the required hour for the Roast Chicken for 2 was more than acceptable. Freshly roasted chicken is generally great on it's own, but it was roasted perfectly here, fresh from the oven and seasoned well. They were out of our first selection of wine but the server was very knowledgeable about their wine list (always a +) and the recommended replacement was a good choice. It was a very nice dinner on a cold December evening...As a side note we arrived there 30 minutes before the start of the dinner menu but they were more than willing to start the roast chicken early for us... I used trusty yelp to find this jem last weekend while visiting Seattle. &#160;We had just flown in and endured a very long public transit commute from the airport, so to say we were famished was an understatement. &#160;We arrived without reservations but they seated us quickly at the bar. &#160;Once we got our menus, I wanted to order everything on it! &#160;Everything looked so tasty! &#160;Oh, and the ambiance was very quaint and cozy. &#160;Reminded me of other french bistros I have visited.We started with the charcuterie sampler with blood sausage, rilleutes(sp?) and cured ham from spain. &#160;Ah-mazing! &#160;My husband very rarely finds rilleutes that remind him of his days in France, but this time they delivered. &#160;Then we had the sweetbreads over a bed of greens, figs and onions. &#160;All the flavors worked really well together. &#160;Then we shared the steak with a mushroom and wine reduction sauce with pomme frites. &#160;OMG! &#160;The sauce was to die for! &#160;But be forewarned, they didn't hold back on the butter. &#160;So good! &#160;We basically licked the goodness off the plate. &#160;This is definitely a necessary visit when we make our way back up north again. I think if I enjoyed French cuisine and was a bit older I could give Le Pichet 5 stars, but because this was my first time eating French food and I am only a college student I feel like I couldn't/didn't fully appreciate this meal. I took my best friend here for her birthday. She is in love with France, French culture, language, and food so I wanted to treat her to some place nice. It was hard on my wallet ($50+ for the two of us), but it was a nice little place. It's small and dark, but very intimate. Definitely a nice date spot for people older than us with real jobs :)I went in November 2009 so I can't remember what we ate. It was really difficult to order since the names were in French too (although the description was in English). I remember eating gizzards of some sort, a fish dish maybe? and a meat dish. Gosh, I wish I could remember what they were. I remember what we had for dessert though. We had "chocolat chaud" - Hot chocolate. It wasn't a drink but a bowl of hot liquid milky chocolate - like a soup. Then there was like a cold whipped cream on the side. It was really really good. At the end of our meal, my friend and I were so full. Our waitress was kinda rude. I can't tell if it's because we were young that she wasn't super nice, but when we had questions she was very knowledgeable about everything. Since this was my first time eating French food it was definitely an experience. I can't exactly describe the taste, but it was different. I don't think many people will get the opportunity to eat French food since it's not as prevalent as, say Italian food or Chinese food. If you want to take your date out to a quaint, nice little French restaurant with good food you should go here. It seems like they have a really nice wine selection as well. But because it is so small make sure to make reservations. I think we went at like 8:30 pm - so plan ahead! :) Probably the most butter for your dollar in the entire city. Terrific value! The quiche comes promptly at the same time every day and sells out shortly after. What time is that? 11h30. But don't tell anybody. These kids are really intentional and deliberate with their frenchiness, and the product is bang on nearly every time. Not so good for vegetarians, but this isn't Le Pichet's fault. The French word for vegetarian is "de quoi?". This review is long overdue. Le Pichet is a wonderful restaurant. The food, wine, service is amazing. I've only been here twice, but both experiences were awesome. Their menu is constantly changing with the season. I highly recommend going with a small group of friends and sharing some wine and the Grand Charcuterie or Assiette ($12.00), which is an assortment of various meats. I love it. The last time I went, the dailey special was Escargot with Spicy Chorizo and spicy butter ($12). This was the best presentation of Escargot I ever had! My girlfriends loved it as well and we couldn't help, but dunk our bread into the hot butter. Yum!The Beet Salad ($7) was perfect and I loved the crispy chickpeas that came with this dish. My least favorite dish I had was the Rabbit Terrine ($9). It had a strange stringy texture; however, our server did warn us about this beforehand. You know, it's really a shame that I don't remember anything besides "maird" &#160;or "ouvre la porte" from the three years of French I took in school, because it would be really fun to write this review in French. &#160;I almost cheated and used Google Translator, but that's no fun. Onward. Oeufs plats, jambon et fromage!!!! (I cut and paste that from their online menu, still cheating.) Translation: &#160;eggs, ham, and cheese. &#160;Is there anything better? I think not. &#160;Paired with their super fresh yummy bread and a cappuccino, you can't go wrong. &#160;Unless you just lost a contract and had a Bloody Mary instead. &#160;Which I did. Okay, okay, I had two. Stop interrogating me! I didn't have to go back to work. Stop hating, wage-earners! But seriously, this place is top notch. &#160;The weather was nice enough to sit on the patio and enjoy our pseudo summer weather. &#160;Do go. &#160;And make sure you order the olives. Divine! Really wonderful atmosphere in the the busy city center. Sitting in their intimate space feels special, and makes an great impression on out of town guests. Food is wonderful and consistent, like others mention. The bar puts out some very nice cocktails as well. Recommended. Good freakin' food. I had the eggs, ham and Gruyere and it was so good. I highly recommend it. Best eggs I ever had! Also had a cheese plate that was good as well. My only thing about this place it that it is so cramped. I didn't mind though. I got a seat at the bar right away. Also, the waitresses are friendly. They recommended a good wine, can't remember what it was called, but they know their stuff. I initially bookmarked this place for breakfast, but ended up coming here for dinner. Le Pichet is a cafe that employs four or five star food without the reaping prices. Tiled floors, old wooden paneling, and a comely marble-top bar, The Pitcher is very French and very casual. Hard boiled eggs were offered as a bar snack and saucers with sugar cubes and mustard were the staples for condiments. Our server was attentive without being officious, and was never shy to demonstrate his familiarity with french cuisine (and bourban). Sadly, tables were full when we arrived so we sat at the bar for our meal. I do wish there was more room to put our things. We had to drape our coats/bags over our legs while we were seated and take them off whenever we had to get up. Not very accommodating if you have stuff with you. -1 star.Breakdown of the food:The bread was fantastic, crunchy crust with a super soft center. We started with their oysters and french onion soup. The oysters were local, fresh, and tasty, but ity bitty. I only recommend those if you don't mind paying 12 dollars for six. The French Onion soup was true to tradition. Served with bread and melted Gruy&#232;re on top, it was very heart-warming and balanced. There was just enough sherry and onion flavor, and it was NOT over salted for once. This is one of the best french onion soups I've had to date. The trout from Idaho? was pan-seared in a brown butter sauce and served with a side of sky-high shoe-string fries. The trout was tender, juicy, and subtly seasoned. Aside from the butter and S&amp;P it was unadulterated allowing the flavor of the trout to really shine. The fries were like chips, crisp and salty. YUM! I saw quite a few people eating this dish.Grumps had the duck and liked everything except for the liver. He tried to convince himself it was a mushroom so he could fool himself into eating it, though I've never had a gamey mushroom before. The sauce for his dish was sweet and smokey, very similar to chinese BBQ. Their portions were generous and heavy with butter so we didn't have room for dessert, but I was blown away by their homemade salted caramel. They were soft, gooey, little treats, the perfect amount of sweetness to end the meal. I would definitely come back here if I had the opportunity! Loved it. Granted, we did not do a full dinner, but the charcuterie plate and authentically French cocktails were both delicious and charming. Would have to spend more time to give it the fifth star, but on first glance a compelling little bistro.A charmer with class. I only had about a day or so to experience Seattle and Le Pichet was one of the first things I came to see. I wanted to be able to fit in all my eating desires into one day and Le Pichet made it very easy for me to.I actually came here for lunch on my own and ordered the Pork Belly. I was expecting something very succulent and grand and filling. It was succulent, it wasn't "grand", and it certainly was not filling. My dish arrived and it was three 1inch square pieces atop some cold asparagus. The flavor of the asparagus was good but it was just weird eating it cold. And, the pork serving was a lot less than I had imagined. I guess my American diet forgot that French foods aren't served in large quantities. I also know that pork belly is usually pretty fatty and fat aside, I maybe had about 3 small slivers of actual meat to eat. I was still hungry. I relied on the bread to fill me for the time being.The dish was about $10. I was kind of disappointed. The reason why I am still giving this place 4 stars is because they do deserve it for flavoring and such. I noticed there were quite a few people in the place who had very small portions and were just fine with that. I think I just expected too much. We first are here three years ago &amp; it is our fave whenever we feel like french food and a cool cafe atmosphere. This place is long and narrow and it has a great ambiance. The food is very good and I always get the cheese plate as well as the olives. The salade verte is really good due in part to the mustard hazelnut dressing and they put the perfect amount on the greens. This last time we were there I tried the creamy leek &amp; jerusalem artichoke soup with blue cheese on top. This was outstanding. My husband switches between the hazelnut crusted fish and the whole roasted chicken. This chicken is off the map. It takes at least an hour but well worth the wait! It comes with dandelion greens and ham hock.Nice staff here, great wine selections &amp; bar. Sometimes this place is SO busy but if you can get there early especially on a weekend you can get seated right away. Lots of window shopping around here so the wait can be fun. This was my second time at Le Pichet--I liked it even more than the first. &#160;I'm a Seattle native, even though I currently live in nyc. &#160;This is probably my favorite French restaurant in Seattle.This time, we had the chevre, cherry, and bacon salad to start, along with the house smoked salmon with oranges. &#160;Both were good, although I enjoyed the salad more than the salmon. &#160;The people next to us ordered the varied charcuterie plate, which also looked really nice (the people next to you may be in very close proximity...I enjoyed this, but I imagine some people wouldn't). &#160;We then shared the quail, which came with really wonderful pommes frites. &#160;To finish we had the nectarine tarte (perfect for August). &#160;We shared a demi-pichet of a nice, light red that the waitress recommended.This places is nice but casual, not cheap but not wildly pricey, either (at least by nyc standards). &#160;There are plenty of "adventurous" items on the menu (we had the steak tartare the first time, which was also really good), but plenty of safe bets as well. &#160;I really cannot reccommend it highly enough. &#160;Perfect way to spend a beautiful summer evening. &#160;I need to find somewhere like it in nyc! Very good. I am not used to this type of food, but the ensemble I got on my plate was quite good. Some tasty meats, onions, pickles, and melted pot of some rich cheese. MmmAlso had the hot chocolate thing (excuse my French... ha!). It was like a melted bittersweet chocolate bar and whole cream. It was quite tasty. If you are looking to just eat dinner, this place will not make you happy. You don't eat dinner at Le Pichet, it is more of a languorous linger of wine, cheese, and the livers of various animals. If you do not like French food and/or are not an adventurous eater, this place will also not make you happy. &#160;It's a pate-foie-gras-stinky-cheese-red-wine-caf&#233;-au-&#173;lait-baguette pile-up. Love her for what she is. &#160;The service here is invisible, which I love. &#160;There is a certain anticipation of your needs that the wait-staff here has down pat. &#160;No faux friendliness, but no attitude, just crisp professionalism. &#160;One teeny-tiny downside- the tables are rather close together, which, when you hate people as much as me, can be a little annoying. &#160;But, I just pretend that I am somewhere glamorous where space is at a true premium...Paris, New York, London, Heaven. I cannot believe that this place exists in Seattle. &#160;It makes me feel transported to a land where no one wears fleece.One more thing. If you are going in the evening, which I insist that you must, pretend that you live somewhere glamorous and make reservations. We popped in for brunch and I was quickly &#160;enamored of the tiles on the floor and dark gleam of the wooden bar. We had a charcuterie plate (Assiette de charcuterie) and baked eggs with ham and cheese with glasses of the sweetest hand squeezed orange juice I've tasted. The charcuterie was very generous and I loved sampling all Le Pichet had to offer. The Oeufs Plats, Jambon et Fromage was oozing cheese and the salty ham mixed in well with my melting yolks. I scoop up the lot with a piece of french bread and chewed away blissfully, happy to be in Seattle eating good food. Really, really, really good meal here. &#160;The highlight for me was the whitefish rillettes appetizer which was served over a mayonaissy salad that was bright and so flavorful. &#160;The 5 dollar hazelnut bibb lettuce salad is one of the best deals in Seattle. &#160;It is so simple but so wonderful. &#160;We did order the roast chicken as one of our items and it did take the hour to prepare that they warn you about. &#160;By the time it came out we were all fairly full but oh my goodness is that chicken insanely good. &#160;It is now actually my mom's requested death bed meal. &#160;None of us at the table have had chicken that was that juicy, moist and well seasoned. &#160;It really was exceptional. &#160;At 34 dollars you might think it needed to be exceptional but it is a very large portion. &#160;On the menu it says for two people but the server actually suggested splitting it 3 ways. &#160;We did that and they were still very large portions. &#160;The deserts were very good. &#160;One was a rice pudding cake with fresh berries and in some cream. &#160;It was well executed and satisfying. &#160;The service was good. &#160;We did have my 1.5 year old son with us and you could tell that they don't get a lot of little ones in there. &#160;But they still were accommodating (no high chair though). I think that this place offers one of the best price to quality ratios in Seattle. I love french bistros and this one is among the best. &#160;Really cute restaurant, with limited seating, and in typical french bistro style ... they have to move the table to squeeze you into a seat lined against the wall and you have to sit with another couple if you're a party of two. &#160;Although, maneuvering in and out of your seat is a task, it can be quite nice and intimate. &#160; The first time I came here, my bf took me for dessert =) We had the hot chocolate. &#160;It really isn't hot chocolate at all though if you ask me ... it was more like a cup of melted chocolate ... thick and scooped up by the spoonful. &#160;They serve it with a bowl of whipped cream on the side! So incredibly indulgent, but good! We also had an order of their beignets that were great! This time around we came here for brunch and were seated right away. &#160;(noon or 1PM on a Saturday). &#160;I ordered the sandwich en baguette $6.50, I opted for the baguette with a cheese selection from the cheese board. &#160;A generous amount of cheese and for someone who loves cheese I was only able to finish about 1/3. &#160;My bf ordered the OEufs plats, jambon et fromage $8.00, this was eggs, ham, and cheese basically. &#160;The egg was perfectly cooked and served with a baguette. &#160;I would recommend this for breakfast or brunch! Do come here if you're visiting Seattle ... next time I will come and have the hour long baked chicken! One word: QUICHE!You cannot go wrong with their quiche. I dream of it. I fantasize about it. I need it. I love it. Please try it, I know you'll agree. Best quiche I've ever had! Le Pichet is so, so adorable. It's cozy and homey with a small bar that runs most of the length on one side and tables along the other. Katy H brought me here for a pseudo-breakfast so we ordered quiche and a cheese plate. It's the breakfast of champions after all.First of all the quiche is gargantuan. Seriously, I'm glad I had Katy's help in eating it because it was way too big for one person, but left to my own devices I may have tried to do just that. Then there was the cheese plate to nibble on. I really liked that you could order a board of cheese or you could order it by the ounce. We went with the board and it had the most delicious cheeses.A small side note -we had iced tea and I loved the little silver pitchers the refills came in. It seems a silly detail to note, but I really enjoyed them. Stopped by for lunch at around 2pm with my boyfriend and missed out on the quiche. He ordered the "gratin lyonnais" (French Onion soup) while I ordered the "petite omelette aux anchois, salade au piment d'Espelette" (omelette w/ anchovy, potatoes, olives and green onions).Let's just say I was too busy drinking his soup the whole time because it was so warm and delicious in comparison to the small portioned and plain omelette. There was nothing too special about my dish. Just go with the soup, it's the best French Onion soup I've ever tasted! (Probably because it's the only one I've ever tasted, but I'm just going to go ahead and say it will most likely be the best one I will have!) The quiche was a hit at our table. It was a party of five on a Thursday lunch break and we had a variety of delicious items. I really enjoyed the baked cod/cheese potato souffle like dish I had (check out my photo). It came with lots of crusty bread and olives. Simple and filling. And to top it off... I of course had a chocolate croissant. Rich and flaky, just how I like it. Stop by Le Pichet for great simple, no fuss eating. The basics never tasted so good. First time @ Le Pichet. Nice, quiet, cozy little spot in downtown. I had Country style pork p&#226;t&#233; with honey and walnuts - had cornichons and mustard on the side as well.The portion was good and it had a good mixture of sweet, salty and meaty. =)Cute spot to check out when you are in the area. I've always walked by Le Pichet on my way home from work and always made a mental note to try it, however until yesterday morning, I never manage to remember to go there. A few friends and I decided to have brunch there, I had hoped to be able to sit outside but it was a chilly summer afternoon, not a warm one, so we sat in the cafe instead. We decided to have coffee all around and oh my god, the coffee was sooo gooood. I devoured two cups before the server even came to take our order. And it was only drip coffee! Not even fancy pants french pressed espresso whatev. As a person who doesn't eat any sort of pork (and that includes bacon), the selection pretty much leaves me with either cheese or anything with just chicken lover terrine. I got a little apprehensive, since I'm not the biggest liver fan, but I wanted to try something new, so I decided to go with a tartine with mustard and chicken liver terrine. Jonathan K got the quiche of the day along with another friends, while the others got the egg, ham and gruyere plate and charcuterie plate. I'm glad that I decided to get the terrine on a sandwich, because the chicken liver aftertaste was still a little strong for me, so I ended up adding a bit more mustard to even it out. But the tartine was delicious, and everyone else enjoyed their dishes, too.For dessert, it got a bit weird. We ordered this sort of flourless cake dessert that was on the board, but ended up getting a pot de creme rice pudding instead. Apparently the person who wrote the menu wrote the wrong thing. Even though the dessert was good, I still would have preferred to be told first that what we ordered wasn't available instead of being immediately given the substitue.All in all, it was yummy. I'm not too sure how often I can go there for brunch (which is my fave meal to go out to eat) given that the non-pork selection is pretty sparse if you want meat, but what I had was delicious. Maybe I'll try the cheese next time. I love chicken and I was determined to eat this "roasted chicken for two." My mother and I ordered it right away. &#160;The "Washington natural chicken roasted to order, saut&#233;ed green beans with garlic, summer savory and croutons" takes 1 hour after ordering. &#160;As soon as you sit down order it!I had a special salad with goat cheese which was quite tasty to help make the time go by faster. &#160;But it didn't help. &#160;As an antsy person to begin with, waiting an hour for chicken was like an eternity. &#160;Once the plates came out, I was ready to dig in. &#160;Since one bird for two people is still quite a lot, I didn't think I was going to finish it. &#160;The chicken is crispy on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside. &#160;I devoured every piece I took. &#160;Amazingly I finished it all. &#160;It's not far fetched to say this was one of best roasted chickens I've eaten.After eating that much chicken, you would think I would be full which I was, but ordered some dessert anyway. &#160;They had a peaches and cream which was simple as even I could make it at home, but was a perfect ending to a perfect meal. &#160;You see it's just a fact that produce is better on the West Coast and this proved me right. &#160;The service was great as our waitress was quite knowledgeable and friendly. &#160;If you love chicken and you happen to be in Seattle, definitely stop by Le Pichet, you won't be disappointed. wow. I came here because it's a favorite of my boyfriend's. I was visiting there alone.Such a cute place simple and clean. I ordered coffee and thenI asked the waiter what she would recommend and it was a special, the quiche. oh, the quiche! it was a slice the size of my head made with Gruy&#232;re cheese. I almost fell outta my seat. I wished there was someone there to experience it with me...but I WILL be coming here again. the staff was friendly...can't wait to go back and try something new Le Pichet is probably the best French restaurant in Seattle. &#160;It is a sister restaurant to my favorite capitol hill haunt: cafe presse. &#160;Some of the items are actually on both menus (foie de volaille, salade verte, beef tartare, hangar steak); however, Le Pichet's higher end dining experience means those dishes are even more thoughtful made. &#160;The dressing on the salade verte is markedly different from the dressing on cafe presse's version and I must say that I like it more.My friend Antony L, whose review is right above mine, had the beef tartare here and a week later I had the beef tartare at presse - this dish was very similar (less room for culinary maneuvering with raw beef I think) at both - and both were FANTASTIC. &#160;The sides at Pichet though were better in my opinion. &#160;If you are not scared of raw beef, this is a great option.I got the onglet (hangar steak) special for the night and boy was it delicious. &#160;If you've had the same dish at cafe presse then I'd definitely recommend trying this dish at Pichet, but it is seriously better. &#160;The outside crust is imbued with intense flavor and that to me is what put it ahead of presse's version. &#160;The onglet et frites is not to be missed if it is available for the night!!Disclaimer: this was my 3rd time here and I've only been for dinner (never lunch/brunch). Every November il est temps pour les Beaujolais-nouveau!After 10 glasses of wine, (I know, holy shit!) I don't remember much, other than a great time was had by all (me!) Hands down, the best French food I have had anywhere in the North West. In fact, among the best French food I have had in America.Their menu constantly changes, so I cannot talk about any specific dishes. But the bread was stunning, and everything that came after was remarkable, too. A wonderful French Bistro in perfect form.Excellent Gratin Lyonnais, Salad Verte, hanger steak with Pomme Frites and the roasted chicken are all a sure hit for any pallete. Walked by this place by accident, it turned out really good.This place is just a small french cafe no fancy decor or atmosphere or presentation on the food. &#160;We ordered racelette and two beers all good and price is reasonable around DT area. You will laugh when I tell you how I found this place. I found it on my iphone on Urban Spoon. Normally when I use this app, I get sketchy places that I wouldn't dare venture to but this time, I got lucky and decided to check it out. This place is tiny, cozy, romantic even. I came on a Thursday evening around 6 pm and the place was packed. We were asked if we had a reservation, which I didn't think we needed, so we had a choice between sitting at the bar or sitting at a table for 45 minutes. Not wanting to be rushed, we picked the bar which worked just fine for us.It had the exact feel of a little French cafe - the only thing missing was the second hand smoke. The tables were pushed very closely together and maybe had 15 tables in total. The service was prompt and friendly while not being overly obnoxious and involved. We started with a Pellegrino Limonata which fit perfectly with our setting. I overheard the bartender talking about some alcoholic cider which I'd like to try the next time around. We had the saucisson as our appetizer which was different from what I expected it to be but still deliciously tasty. It was dry sausage, very flavorful, dipped in oil with garlic. Yum! For our main courses, we both ordered the hangar steak with fries. My steak was a little undercooked and my husband's was a little overcooked but somehow, they were still delicious. I loved the peppercorn sauce. The best part though were the fries. These were some of the best. Overall for 3 drinks, 2 steak-frites, and an appetizer, it was around $55 which was pretty reasonable. A gem in the Pike Place Market area. Love it! I stopped by Le Pichet recently with Jamie Y. Our lunch started off ominously when an older woman on her way out asked me if I was on a date with Jamie or my phone (actually I was holding my iPod Touch but whatever). And before I could even say anything she had basically walked out and here husband just murmured a "Well it's a valid question" as he slunk out of the restaurant behind her. The funny thing was that we had only been seated for a couple minutes, were talking to each other, and if they had bothered to ask they would have found out we were checking in on Yelp and taking some notes on what we were going to order. Our server came up to us shortly after that and Jamie and I could have both sworn she was Katy H.'s younger sister. She was a cute younger woman who had a lot of energy and the hair and freckles to match Katy H. At the end of the meal Jamie asked if she had an older sister but sadly she did not and was in no way related to Katy. Le Pichet is a restaurant and we did get around to ordering some food! To start we had the house made smoked salmon served with an olive and orange vinaigrette and cracked black pepper. Then in addition to that we had the grand assiette (five item order off the charcuterie menu). And we also ordered the cheese plate. Overall I was happy with everything and particularly enjoyed the salmon. The pork pate and chicken liver terrine were also wonderful. I don't handle cheese well so I only tried minuscule bites but what I tried was pretty good but definitely wasn't as exotic as some of the other cheese plates I've tried. To be honest this place felt like a more grown up, more interesting, and better located big brother/sister to Cafe Presse (which is owned by the same people). But both suffer from the same issue for me; the portions are extremely tiny. Despite spending a decent amount of money it felt just like a snack to me. If you are someone with a big appetite I'd suggest eating somewhere else first, walking around, and then stopping by for some good bites accompanied by friendly service. So French and so charming and it's so fun to say "Le Pichet."Decorated like a Parisian bistro from the 1940s with a small bar in the back and wooden tables set along a bench that runs the length of the narrow restaurant. &#160;Chalkboards on the wall list their special fromages et charcuterie. &#160;I was dying to try the blood sausage but I didn't want to freak out my date.We ordered a few things to share:Whitefish rillettes on tartines served over an endive, radicchio and pea salad. &#160;The lemony vinaigrette on this was so delicious.Chickpea fritters with arugula and watermelon chunks. &#160;The falafel was perfectly cooked, delicately crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.Steak frites, need I say more? &#160;Sadly the frites were best part of this plate, crispy and greasy and salty. &#160;The steak was ordered medium-rare but wasn't as tender as I had hoped.We also shared a pichet of cabernet; that's how the restaurant got its name. &#160;Overall, a wonderful meal in a place that makes you want to linger. If Caffe Presse is my favorite day spot in Seattle, then Le Pichet is my go to spot for French cuisine at night.I tried the Beef Tartare and the Hanger Steak with Fritz and both were done to perfection! &#160;The Salade Verte is ever better than Caffee Presse's!The Assiette de charcuterie is a must; both the hams and the patte were out of this world good!The servers were nice and very knowledgeable, the decor was simple and pleasant. &#160;Definitely a great date place.I'd say this is my favorite dinner restaurant in Seattle. Absolutely adore this place!Food is fantastic.Atmosphere is perfect; you just feel that you belong.Prices are very reasonable.Service is ... well, as good as it gets for a french place:)) I seriously do not remember what the service was like, so it must have been just right. I do not love Le Pichet. &#160;I do not hate Le Pichet.I think it's...ok.We came for dinner w/ some friends and I had high hopes for my food. &#160;My dish looked good, but it was kind of...fatty. &#160;And rich. &#160;Which is normal for French food, but not so much to my liking.Meh. &#160;I suppose if friends want to meet here for dinner I'll try to give it another go, but I'd rather skip French altogether. &#160;Unless it's for bread, cheese, and/or crepes.And wine. Bottom Line - Food is consistent and well portioned. &#160;Great place to come sit with friends and slowly eat while talking. Prices are reasonable, as well. Menu selection isn't the biggest, but you'll find plenty to eat and leave satisfied. The food here is very consistent. I came on 29 December 2010 for lunch with a couple friends. &#160;I ordered:Deufs plats, jambon et fromage "Two eggs broiled with ham and gruy&#232;re" ($8) - This went really well with the side bread. Mmmmm!French Onion Soup ($11) - This is pretty heavy, but you don't have to eat all of it and the onions are fantastic. &#160;Along with my friends' meals, our bill (for 3 of us) came to $62.50 + 6.25 = $68.75 before tip. This place can get crowded...be prepared to be cozy!One of the most romantic restaurants I've been to in a while. Joy, I *know* full well you're the one responsible for adding Le Pichet's contribution to the Foodie 100 list to the list. &#160;And mark my words, I will have my vengeance. &#160; A chicken liver terrine? &#160;Really? &#160;Anyhow, it was on the list, and I'm doing all 100 on the list, so in I go to Le Pichet for their offering, the gateau au foie de vollaile. &#160;Obviously, I wasn't going to be a fan of this, so why the 4? &#160;Well, I knew I was going to find it positively vile, so we ordered other things from the menu, and those were quite good.The Lady Vader ordered one of their sandwiches featuring Zoe's salami, some gerkin pickles, assorted mustards, etc. &#160;I grabbed the quiche of the day. &#160;Sandwich perfectly balanced, wonderful bread (as you'd expect of a French restaurant), quiche assembled as well as you'll find anywhere, wonderful ingredients, which is hard for me to say. &#160;As you can tell from the movies, I'm typically not a big fan of the French. &#160;Well, OK, maybe it's not patently obvious, but little known fact: &#160;Every Stormtrooper that is killed in the movies? &#160;French. &#160;It's the little details that make the magic happen, people.Frankly, we needed these quality dishes to prepare ourselves for the terrine, or else I'd have gone into a rage killed everyone in the restaurant after I took the requisite bite. &#160;Anyhow, out it comes. &#160;We each say a quick prayer and grab a tiny (as in, enough to fill a Tic Tac) &#160;forkful and take the bites. &#160;To Lady Vader's credit, she managed to down it without any real issue. &#160;Chicken livers for me, though? &#160;They always trigger a gag reflex. &#160;I can keep down a century egg, roasted scorpions, insects, rancor eyes, roast Jawa, and almost anything else. &#160;I can't do livers. &#160;I damn near had it come back up on me. &#160;It was so disgusting, I can't even describe it. &#160;It was like eating pureed Ewok tongue mixed with Gungan spit. &#160;Huh, I guess I CAN describe it. &#160;The Dark Side is so awesome. &#160;Honestly, I don't know how ANYBODY can be into chicken liver. &#160;Joy, I will not forgive you for this.Here's where the 4 comes in, however: &#160;Even though I knew we were going to hate it before we even ordered it. &#160;Even though we never even wanted it taken off the bill, they took it off anyways because they have a policy of not charging for things you don't like - even if you knowingly ordered something gross just for the sake of posterity. &#160; Service was incredibly friendly through and through, the decor of the place was quite lovely, and they had a fairly impressive wine selection from what we could tell. &#160;I was still too busy trying to keep the terrine down to order any. &#160;You don't even wanna know how hard it is to clean the inside of the helmet when something comes back up.I'm docking it a point not because of the chicken liver or anything else discussed so far, but only because interpreting the menu can be a challenge if you don't speak French, and because if you aren't into some of the more "creative" cuts of meat (such as livers, blood sausage, tongue, etc.) you are going to have some difficulty finding much to eat here. &#160;Just do yourself and ignore the Foodie 100 list when you get to this item, though; &#160;it doesn't belong. &#160;If you want something great from Le Pichet, stick to the quiches or the sandwiches.4 Deathstars. The only food I eat is Asian. Just... Because... &#160;HahaBut I do enjoy sampling something else, every now and then.Few girlfriends of mine wanted to check out this cute French cafe so....We did. I was hoping there would be something not all about bread, butter or P&#226;t&#233;. Of course, that's rude. There will always be something anew to try of a different cuisine.I ordered the, "OEufs au vinaigre sur salade de pommes de terre, pruneaux et endive" and translated to English as,"House pickled egg on a salad of red potatoes, fennel, Belgian endive and brandy marinated prunes"I loved it! The salad was unique. Precisely the perfect word for this dish. The size for this dish was also my style. Not large or tiny, but the correct amount for a lunch.The atmosphere of the cafe was... French... I would think.The music -french pop- how the people of the restaurant were - bubbly and romantic with the food, I would say ^^ - and the employees.. well... Fun! Food was seriously delicious. Service kinda sucked. Expect t a looong wait to get your order taken, I didn't mind but if I was really hungry I would have been annoyed. They made me pour my coffee from cafe darte &#160;into one of their mugs...really? TOO EFFING CRAMPED!! I'm docking a star for crampability factor. I get claustrophobic when i don't even have ELBO room where i am sitting! Also when your trying to eat and people walking down the teeny tiny walkway keep tagging you in the back of your head, well that really screws up my meal and makes me WAY frickin agitated, like almost get up and pound the f@ck out of someone agitated. i should probably dock more stars, but the food was flippin awesome! The waitress was a snippety little beotch who was never around, maybe I should dock it another star..hmmmNOPE the food was bomb.So the french onion soup, was the BEST I have had EVER. The Eggs with Ham &amp; Gruyere was off the hook (especially when you add some dijon)! The snausages, ZOMG good especially when you dip bread in the greasy drippings that come with!!So food was a FIVE star, But the place and service in reality 1-2 star An oasis, I tell you! &#160;What's better after a trying, stressful court hearing (which we won, of course), and hobbling around downtown Seattle with a sprained ankle (me) and on crutches (my colleague/friend and lunch-mate) then sliding into the corner booth in the window at Le Pichet for a weekday brunch? &#160;NOTHING, that's what. &#160;NO-THING.Our waitress alerted us that the breakfast pastries were going fast - so on impulse I said we'd have the last chocolate croissant. &#160;This arrived with our coffees, and both (the pastry and the coffee) were excellent and just what our weary selves needed to start to come around after our hectic morning. &#160;Spotting frothy orange juice being served to another table, I asked about it (fresh squeezed! delish!) and so asked our waitress to bring that on, too.For our meal, we shared the salade verte, which was as promised the most beautiful, bright green bed of butter or bibb lettuce ever, lightly dressed in a mustard vinaigrette and peppered with hazelnuts, and then we each had the baked eggs with ham. &#160;I'm getting hungry now just writing about it.This was a simply marvelous weekday brunch. &#160;We felt spoiled but revived, and could head back to the office not only triumphant, but also well-fed. If you're wondering around Pike Place market and want a really superb little place to steal off too then this is it. Stonkin; place. The best place for coffee AND snack food in seattle. Why ? because there are great coffee places and plenty of them, more rarely there are great places to eat. rarely do the two come together. le pichet is small, very parisienne in feel - the coffee is strong and old school and the food is super fresh - like paris - not huge portions but superb and tasty. the cheese (fromage) plate is particularly good. not to be missed. Excellent casual ambiance. Really feel like your sitting in Paris. The food is wonderful and reasonably priced to boot. I could sit in Le Pichet for hours. Keep the delicious cheese and bread coming please. 3.5 stars... but i gave it a 4 because the place is cute...Stopped by for brunch on my last rainy day in Seattle... this is a cute little french place... perfect for a rainy day! &#160;The menu selection is quite limited... but there are some good stuff on the menu. we had the two eggs with ham and gruyere... everyone in the restaurant seems to have gotten this... so we had to have it... it was ok... the dish comes to you very hot... and it's good... but very heavy to me.i had their special salad of the day which includes pickled eggs... very different. &#160;the portion was small, but the salad was tasty.we also shared a charcuterie plate... which was my favorite! &#160;ok, to be exact... the chicken liver terrine was my favorite! I can just eat bread, butter, coffee, and terrine for breakfast!! service that morning was kinda slow... but it's ok.... we made friends with our neighbors Having their "rillettes de lapin" was totally worth getting the dirty look from my pet rabbit at home.OK, it wasn't entirely bunny meat, it had pork mixed in as well! &#160;But what a savory dish this was... The rillette was buttery, peppery, and had that simple sophistication! &#160;The texture was wonderful as well - the lean rabbit meat was perfectly spreadable since it has pork mixed into it, went well with my baguette - a very homey taste! &#160;The watercress salad and the acidity of the cherry tomatoes &amp; cornichons balance out the fattiness of the rillette so that your stomach wouldn't get tired of eating so much rich food.My waiter, Ford, was so friendly and nice, extra points for great service! &#160;He recommended me pairing pastis with my rillettes, which was a great choice! &#160;Normally I hate star anise/licorice, but the spiciness of the drink made this rustic dish tasting more complex - absolutely loved it! Katy H. was correct.... one word: QUICHE!I am a fan of this place.. but I found taking family and friends who are not open to trying "gnarley" cuisine wouldn't be wise. Most meat options come from parts of the animal that are less desirable in America. But... this is a French appeal.... and a good one at that! I can't go by this place without going in. &#160;I love sitting people watching, and munching on several of their offerings. &#160;I have a hard time leaving without a scrumptious and decadent cup of the chocolat chaud. &#160;Evil....but in a good way. Wonderful little bistro, well deserving of all the good reviews. &#160;Eating there was just like eating in a neighborhood restaurant in France, which we always enjoy. &#160;We loved the entire meal and the service. We got into Seattle late one night but wanted a little bite to eat. &#160;Le Pichet was the perfect choice. &#160;A tasty mushroom soup with walnuts, crusty bread and a fine glass of wine. &#160;I can't wait to go back. &#160;In a city of numerous wonderful eating places another gem to discover. good butter, meat and drinks. nice cozy space. go there if you are nearby Very authentically French. The first thing I noticed was it was small and cozy. America is all about mass produced, seating for you and your dinner party of 18, etc. Having lived in Paris this place made me feel like I was back at home. The food was excellent. Authentic French dining experience, the only thing missing were snooty waiters(Le Pichet wait staff were quite nice), but that's the one part of French dining I think I can live without. Excellent atmosphere, gorgeous, authentic food, charming staff yum yum yum!add to that, reasonable prices and a pretty, cozy atmosphere. Had dinner here over the weekend. Everything superb. Every aspect was excellent. Le Pichet is such a little slice of Frenchie Heaven!!! I love that their Oysters on the half shell taste more fresh them some of the Pike Street Market other seafood &#160;serving cafes. Their wine and cheese plate pairings along with the salad verte and oysters made for such a &#160;fresh food frenzie stop off &#160;b4 I went shopping in the market. I must return for more. We love Le Pichet! I've been coming here since I moved to Seattle in 2003 and it's held up since. French onion soup, the terrines, oeufs plat, lentals, and their salds are all just great! Home style county French and plenty of Cote du Rhone - which you'd be hard pressed to get a bad bottle of at any price. If you get lucky you might get their chaud, which is just out of this world. Enjoy! Everytime I've gone to Seattle I go here. The vibe in there is great. The second time I went in they had a guy playing guitar in the corner I believe and it was lovely. Oh, and the food is amazing, haha Just love this small French cafe for breakfast. &#160;The menu is simple with choices of savory and sweets so its perfect for most taste's. &#160;My favorite has to be sat at the bar eating their lovely eggs, the CEufs plats, jambon et fromage. &#160;If I'm in the mood for a treat I'll add a Bloody Mary to kick start the day. &#160;A great start to a Sunday :) Le Pichet - Je t'aime! Another great Seattle French restaurant that would feel right at home in Paris itself. I've been on several dates here and find the ambiance to be great for dates, particularly early on in the relationship. It's not fancy seeming enough to feel awkward, but it's special enough to feel pleasant. And the food is always great. Bon apetit! Went here during the big wind storm, it was nice and cozy. I ordered the black cod salad because I was not that hungry, luckily it was not a big salad and just had a few flakes of smoked fish and a few orange segments, with watercress and a sweet dressing, it was a nice flavor. The cheese plate came with nice amounts of really good cheeses. Their desserts really are impressive, nice ending! I love Le Pichet, their food is so good, very authentic, every time I go it like a trip back to Paris ! You gotta try their Hot Chocolate, it is REAL chocolate ... not the usual sugary american hot chocolate, but the real thing ! Their cheese selection is very good, and their dessert always amazing ! artery cloggage worth every delicious bite. I had the OEufs plats, jambon et fromage for breakfast (copied and pasted of course). &#160;I ate by myself and had a cup of coffee, which was refilled generously. &#160;My food came out quick and was piping hot and delicious. Favorite breakfast in Seattle! Ok, so Le Pichet isn't great for vegetarians BUT it is the most authentic Parisian restaurant in downtown. I haven't been to Bastille yet but Le Pichet makes me homesick for France. Now if only someone could educate the waitstaff on the proper pronunciation of Ricard so they would understand me all things would be golden. If you are a veg, like me, there are a few things you can have but don't go expecting gigantic American portions. This is a great place to sit at the bar and dwell... The free music is fantastic but it gets super crowded! Le Pichet feels like home. Every detail is spot on and every dish is made with care. Braised meats in creamy polenta are my favorite in winter. Their simple green salad (butter lettuce with hazelnuts and a white wine mustard vinaigrette) is wonderful all year round. For brunch, baked eggs. Late night go for the frites and a custom made cocktail at the bar. Oh, and how could I forget - their deserts are so good, I usually order two. Food, service, atmosphere, the whole package is wonderful. &#160;The closest thing to having lunch in France. &#160;The beet salad was very unusual, with roasted chick peas and goat cheese; delightful. Split a grande assiette ("big plate" of cold cuts) with my wife. Great ambiance, but the food choices were...lame. &#160;There wasn't any real food on the menu. &#160;Little plates of this or that, but nothing really substantial or satisfying. &#160;We left with heartburn and mostly baguettes in our bellies. Sometimes when I feel cold all the way to my bones only a few things can warm me up. The oeufs plat, &#160;jambon et fromage is at the top of my list. Try it, you will be warm and happy. Le Pichet never disappoints. very cute french bistro. had the sausage and then i fell asleep because it was good. zzzZ Lunch was nice. The service was attentive. Our server was a very pleasant woman. Food was good but a little on the spendy side. I actually ordered the french onion soup because of the price..$11 dollar cup of soup at lunch time! I was thinking if you have the sac to charge this much for 75 cents worth of ingredients it has to be something special...yes it was good but it didn't make me want to run out onto 1st ave and do jumping jacks.... I just loved this place. &#160;The food is geat, the atmoshpere is authentic, the service is wonderful, the food is reasonably priced and not a pretentious vibe in the place. &#160;Everything we had was wonderful. &#160;I just wish that I lived in Seattle so that I could go back to try more food. &#160;In Marin where we live there just isn't anything this good and affordable. &#160;I would definetely eat here again........ I came here when I was a tourist, and now I come there more often now that I live here. &#160;You never go wrong here-- either meeting friends or taking a date. &#160;I wrote in another review for another restaurant that while the food is fine, it wouldn't be a place where I wanted my last meal to be. &#160;Le Pichet is good enough that it certainly is a finalist for my last meal (which hopefully will be many years from now.) If I lived in Seattle I would go to Le Pichet once a week. We were only there 1.5 days and we went twice. It was that good! The pork pate was unbelievable..served with whole grain mustard, cornichons, honey and walnuts. The steak with duck fat fries (yes, duck fat fries) blew my mind. The hubs had the pork special with gnocchi, morel mushrooms, english peas in this yummy creamy goodness. Ahhh...Le Pichet is sooooo good that after an 8 mile hike the only thing that kept me going was the thought that I would soon be dining there again. Put the pate in my mouth! Went to Cafe Presse last night and it reminded me of how much I missed this place! I've only been here for breakfast, but everytime was very good. The service is great and my coffee cup was never more than halfway empty. The meats were yummy (if you like blood sausauge, try it here) and the cheese plate unforgettable. Come here if you're missing Paris, this place makes you feel as if you're dining on the Champs-Elysees! Simply marvellous!Those two words sum this place up perfectly. Nestled on 1st Ave just north of Virginia St (west side of the street), this charming bistro is fantastic! Went with my awesome, divine companion and we were seated at a reserved table, which was a nice touch. The word "r&#233;serv&#233;e" was even chalked on the black slate surface of said table; how cool is that? Staff was courteous, friendly and attentive. The place is small, but nicely decorated with mirrors, a soothing mild yellow paint on the walls and medium woods, all providing a great, intimate ambiance.Enough of my silly prattle, let's get on to what really matters...the food! We started off with some sliced pear and toasted pistachios. Delicious! A great start to cleanse the palate, indeed! We both ordered the same dish; the "Onglet grille et sa sauce aux &#233;pinards, champignons et raifort"...which is French for "really delicious, perfectly cooked hangar steak with spinach (!), mushrooms and an awesome horseradish sauce". Obviously, that's not the literal translation, but you get the idea. :) Best steak I've had in a long time. Hands down. Fries were crispy, yummy goodness! They also have reasonable prices; won't break the wallet or wreck the purse. Definitely go to this place, you will not be disappointed! When we go back, I'm trying something else to further savor and sample their menu. nomnomnom ftw! Adorable cafe. &#160;Love the French vibe, sidewalk seating and delicious options. &#160;We went for brunch - the ham and eggs with Gruyere was amazing, as was my special of the day, quiche. &#160;Both could have used a little salad or fresh fruit to cut the heavy feeling of the dish, but otherwise fabulous. &#160;Great coffee, bread and people watching. Walking around Seattle on a Sunday, decided to stop in for a glass of wine at 5pm. &#160;Nice ambiance, a few people having early dinner and one or two sitting at the bar. They have a good selections of wine by the glass (I had a nice Cote du Rhone village) for $5.50. &#160;The food menu and dishes looked yummy but I didn't eat there so can't say. The only thing missing would have bit a little bit of bread or olives or something to go with my wine. Went here and had a very good meal and dining experience. Service was absolutely top notch, and the waitress was very helpful and informative about the menu. Price was moderate but I can understand because it's basically at Pike's market. Very cramped. Like cramming 10lbs of crap in a 5lb bag. They place's pretty cool, the ambient is very nice, very homey. &#160;I love their coffee, and the chicken pate is to die for!!!! Brioche is excellent!!! overall very nice place to sit down for lunch or breakfast, I've came here several time and would definitely come back I have been meaning to try this place for a while. &#160;Frommer's Travel guides have a section on favorite experiences in Seattle. &#160;Number one on that list is spending a day eating your way through Pikes Place Market starting with breakfast at Pichet. &#160; I went here this morning for a relaxing breakfast with a friend. &#160;We shared their signature breakfast dish the Two eggs broiled with ham and gruyere and their country pork pate with the best pickles. &#160;The atmosphere is as though you are in a small bistro in Paris and the food is first class. &#160;The egg dish had high quality ham, perfect amount of cheese and seasoning. &#160;I am normally more of a soft paste pate person over country style pate, but I surprising thoroughly enjoyed their version. &#160;It was such a great experience that I already want to go back and try more items from the menu.
I'm a judgemental asshole. I can freely admit this now having actually dined here twice, yet shunning it for nearly 10 years. 10 years? Man, I really can be such a snob.Their hash is sublime and I recommend getting it with your eggs poached. Their eggs benedict are heavenly and even the child preaches their good name when it comes to boasting about a damn tasty eggs bennie. My Mom had their potato pancakes and it really brought a tear to my eye when she finally was able to part with one and I could try it. Oh joyous potato pancake with the light smear of sour cream and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. The Dutch Baby is a wonder in of itself and a must to try for newbies. Oh hell, it's a must to have for anyone!The second visit was on a rainy Sunday. We entered the waiting area and was told to go right in as they were already waiting for us. I really thought the cute girl with the rosy applecheeks was just being ...well, cute. But we opened the main door to go into the dining area and sure enough they were waiting for us with menus on the table and waters too.Oh wow, to be treated like a regular and not have to be a regular. Awesome concept! I love pancakes! &#160;Especially when I don't have to make them.But, I usually avoid pancakes houses. &#160;They tend to be filled with huge families causing scenes or obnoxious crowds of hungover newbies. &#160;If you are traveling in either one of these groups, expect a nice long wait. &#160;But if you are a small group of 2-4, they seem to get you sat a lot quicker.The decor is nothing special. &#160;It almost has an old-folk's home appeal to it. &#160;But the food is what you come for. &#160;The coffee is well below Seattle standards, get juice. &#160;But almost anything on the menu is good, especially the pancakes. &#160;I have yet to get the dutch baby, I'm still going through the list of fresh fruit pancakes and crepes! &#160;And the bacon pancakes are awesome! &#160;I only wish they made pancakes puffs like me.The parking is a mess though, save yourself the headache and just park on the street or across the street at the bank. &#160;Oh and tip the waitstaff well, they are always friendly and perky. I really, really, want to like this place. &#160;We even learned to call ahead to get on the list. &#160;We were all ready to &#160;make this our have-to-go place for weekends but after several tries we just can't do it anymore.It ended with the eggs benedict. &#160;You do realize benedict sauce is egg based, right? &#160;That means people will get sick if you hold and serve that sauce at room temp. &#160;Ewww. &#160;Pancakes are okay at best here. &#160;Sometimes service is fast, sometimes slow. &#160;Sometimes they ignore you completely. &#160;You really shouldn't eat bacon anyway, it's bad for you. My first love is the Pancake House in Greenwood Village, Colorado, but this place fulfills my German Pancake cravings here in Seattle.I only come here for either a cheese omelet or the German Pancake, with a side of their thick cut bacon. &#160;The coffee is nothing to write home about so usually I stop for Verite or something else before getting to breakfast to curb that desire.Everything here is huge, but that's what I want for brunch. &#160;I want so much food that I have an excuse to go home and go back to bed....sort of like hibernation style. &#160;I am thankful that this place is everywhere I go so I never have to miss it! &#160;Thank you Original Pancake House!!! Don't come here if you're on a diet!!I first visited this place with my parents about a month and a half ago. My Dad ordered an omelet. OMG! I have never seen such a large omelet in my LIFE! I had the Eggs Benedict, my favorite out-to-eat breakfast, my Step-Mom had eggs and sausage as did my daughter. YUM! My first experience there was extremely favorable, so a second showing was inevitable.And that happened today. Black Friday, a day to avoid shopping centers and malls at all costs, but a good day to eat out as there is nothing but a huge pile of dirty dishes stacked all over my kitchen counters. Thus, a visit to the Original Pancake House was in order. Hubster had the Eggs and Sausage breakfast, I (again) had Eggs Benedict (available on weekends and holidays only. Apparently Black Friday is a Holiday now! Yay for my tummy!), the monster had a scrambled egg and banana pancakes.Service is good, food is fantastic, come hungry and with a bit of patience in case there's a line for seating, but just come!! This place is incredible and decently priced. Eggs benedict are really tasty. &#160;You have to wait in line for a decent amount of time, but the food is good and you can get breakfast at anytime.
Great food &amp; atmosphere - live music on Sunday's is always a plus An old friend &amp; I went to Pies &amp; Pints for dinner &amp; drinks; I ordered the fish &amp; chips and he ordered a pot pie. We were both disappointed by the size of his pot pie so I shared by fish &amp; chips with him after he finished his bite-sized pie. I'd say their pot pies were way overpriced but the fish &amp; chips plate was great. They had a fair selection of drinks but seemed to be out of the most popular brands. The table help was excellent, the music was a little too loud and it made conversation difficult. Good savory pies, Mac and cheese and lots of good beer on tap. What's isn't there to like? A little trendy but not to bad. "rustic" looking in a new way. Worth going to. the pies were...eh. under seasoned. and the service was sh*t poor. not impressed with all the hype ive heard. Like everyone says, the pies are small. &#160;We were really skeptical that we would be full based on the pictures of the pies. &#160;But their mac &amp; cheese side proved to be quite filling --- though there is better mac &amp; cheese elsewhere in the city. &#160;It was pretty reasonably priced .... and it would be a great happy hour place for sure. &#160;The wait can be a little long as there was only one cook there during prime dinner hours. &#160;Take a deck of cards, hunker down, and enjoy! Went there for the first time recently and was pleasantly suprised. The food was a cut above your standard pub grub - very well-prepared, and reasonably priced. Great atmosphere, nice roomy booths. The food is 10 stars - the service is 4. &#160;This was the first place I've been to in Washington since moving here 11 months ago where the food was both affordable and amazing. &#160;We've been to expensive restaurants where the food is great but there definitely seems to be a dearth of unique places that are both affordable and awesome around here. &#160;I'm getting kind of sick of Red Robin all the time.We had to drive about 20 minutes to get to Pies &amp; Pints but it was completely worth it. &#160;We were there on a sleepy Sunday, right around noon. &#160;There only seemed to be one waitress to cover all of the booths in the front of the restaurant and we weren't in a hurry so we didn't say anything to them. &#160;We started with the pretzels and beer cheese sauce. &#160;OMG - it was delicious! &#160;I haven't had a real pretzel like that in ages. &#160;And the dipping sauce was thick and rich and flavorful. &#160;I had the Beef &amp; Mushroom pie in burgundy sauce and my boyfriend had the lamb pie. &#160;The pie crusts were flaky and perfect and the meat inside was good quality. &#160;At first we thought the pies were going to be too small but they were just right. &#160;In fact, I couldn't even finish mine. &#160;We also shared a side of mashed potatoes and took half of it home because it was such a huge portion. &#160;I'd definitely recommend that if you're with a group, have everyone order their own pies and then get one side dish per every two or three people. &#160;The food is rich and hearty and fills you up faster than you think it's going to.They also had a guy there playing keyboard and singing. &#160;I thought it was a little cheesy at first but then he started interacting with the diners and it turned out to be kind of fun. &#160;By the end of our meal, we were the only ones left in the restaurant and he asked us what we wanted to hear. &#160;I told him, "Anything by Billy Joel" and he was off and running with us singing along. &#160;After my boyfriend paid the check, I sought out the cook and told him what a fabulous meal it was and that we'd be back. &#160;Next time, we're bringing friends! The pies are small (about the size of my palm), but awesome! The pastry part of it is soooo good. Pie comes with a side, so together it's enough food. It's a fun place, with various size booths (some for larger parties, a group was playing board games while we were there), and some bar stool height tables. The pints were good - they had good beer and cider options. It's definitely a fun place, with the downside being that the service is a bit slow. The pies are deceivingly filling, it's like me big things come in small packages ;) The first time I came here my friend and I were craving some serious grub after a late-night study session. Even though it was happy hour, we had to got the pie and a side for a whopping $9.95 :). At this point I'm all smiles, but it even gets better with a pint of their beer offerings. So between the two of us we had the steak and potato, as well as, the lamb and potato. (Can you tell we are a meat and potatoes kind of person?) I am partial to the lamb and potato for sure, I mean that is already my favorite protein, but when you put it inside a perfect pie crust in a delicious sauce I don't know how you could go wrong. The food bus doesn't even stop there it is complimented by your choice of soup or fries, if you want to "splurge" for a $1 more you can substitute with a small house salad, mashed potatoes &amp; gravy, mac &amp; cheese, or sweet potato fries. That was easy for a $1.00 more I got my SWEET POTATO FRIES ON (also on the happy hour menu)! I think I've just grown sad that I am no longer in Seattle to enjoy these NOMS! There is definitely something special about pot pies. &#160;With a buttery crispy crust and a hot pie filling... it makes you wonder why you don't see them more often. &#160;But Pies &amp; Pints does em right. &#160;My friends and I ordered different pies each and they all looked and tasted great. &#160;The only downside was that the pie to side size ratio was a little off. &#160;I was left craving more pie since they were kind of small although the side orders were pretty huge. &#160;They are not cheap and that left me feeling a little unsatisfied because I don't like filling up on fries too much and would have preferred more pie. &#160;Needless to say, I liked the pie and was considering ordering another. &#160;I think 3 pies for 2 people would be perfect. &#160;I dont know that they offer a deal like that but they should if they don't already.The bar has a good feel and a lot of space and it was definitely a place I would frequent again. &#160;It could be a good date spot for originality and a good vibe. &#160;The beer selection was decent and about what you'd expect for a traditional Seattle bar/restaurant. &#160;It was tough to choose which pie I ordered and I made the decision for lamb and it was pretty great. &#160;The steak one that my friend ordered was more flavorful however the lamb was tender and great. &#160;I think the lamb was cooked in a wine sauce which was good but didnt have quite the spice I was hoping for.Overall, 4 stars and I will update my review the next time I get there to try more. A couple weeks ago I made way to pies and pints after getting off work . I walked in on a tuesday night the same night they have open band night , i could not for the life of me tell the name of the bad that night but they cool , funky and like 19 members strong . I picked a menu and sat down , with in no time flat a young man had taken order and has back with my lava rock porter , yummy beer . After half a pint I moved down to the bar area to look around . They have a pool table and its free to play . &#160;they good stock of beer , cider and the hard stuff and cute bartender . My india curry was very very good as was the sweet potato fries , they staff there was great and the place has good feel to it . I will be back there soon. Pies rock as do pints but yet, but yet ... Over an hour and a half wait. That's insanity. The second longest time I've ever waited for food is Paseo and that was about 40 minutes. There must be nights where they're slammed but dang, our stomachs were not thrilled. Thankfully, we ordered it to go so we knew what we were in for. Wait time aside, the food was just fine but didn't live up to what I was expecting. -- The pies are pretty darn small. They take the word "hand-held" seriously although they are around the same size as "Pie" in Fremont. But Fremont's pies are at least a few bucks cheaper!-- Indian curry was nice and spiced, the traditional chicken pot pie was comforting and the beef mushroom burgundy was tangy and well, beefy. Despite the first impression of the small pie size, it was enough with the sides you could choose from for their combo meal ($10). -- The side of mac &amp; cheese was surprisingly disappointing. I hear rumors of how awesome their daily mac offerings were but thought the standard fare a bit boring and played a little too safe. Decided to have my hot sauce bottle on hand to give it a little kick. The portion size was nice and hearty though, almost more food than the pie itself!The place is nice and spacious but I definitely wouldn't go back during the weekend though, a couple of little pies shouldn't have taken so long. They have a diverse menu w/ daily pie, soup and mac specials and a choice of even having your pie served IN the soup a la "Pie Float." Seems like a cool place to hang out on a weeknight but wouldn't go out of my way! My peeps and I hadn't really ate all day and were starving! I managed to convince them to take a trek from the Eastside to try out this joint, which I of course found on Yelp. I'm glad we did!We showed up like around 2:30, and they open at 2. The place was pretty dead, only a couple of other people were in there. As some other reviewers have said, service can be a bit iffy and was. We got menus right away but it took a while to order... one person at my table put her head down to take a nap :) Food came out quick and hot, but them it took quite a long time to get our bill. We weren't really in a hurry so this all turned out to be OK.I thought the prices were decent. $10.00 for a pie with a side... some of the sides are an extra buck. The beers were pricey, but that's pretty much the norm anywhere. We started with the Welsh Pretzel appetizer which came with beer cheese and 3 pretzels. It was good, but honestly not worth almost $7. We all loved our pies, they weren't teeny, they weren't huge... just right in my opinion. One guy in my group thought they were too small... but he likes food to be as big as his head, so go figure. The side of mac n cheese that I got was great and freakin HUGE! I took half my food home, so for $11 bucks or so I got two meals :) The side of fries and salad that my other friends got were really nice too.Also to note... the place was spacious, comfy booths, clean, funky art and nice architecture. Had a good overall vibe and it would be a lot of fun if it were packed. To sum it up... yummy food and spotty but friendly service. I'll come back but not when I am in a hurry. Its really just like what a neighborhood pub should be: Lively, music, lots of great beer, and hot comfort food! Tucked away in the hood of Roosevelt it can be easy to miss, but once you've gotten a whiff of its savory pies and fries in the wait it'll will draw ya'll in! They have a great selection of veggie to meaty pies along with some great soups and mash potatoes! Heaping platefuls. The pot pies themselves are pretty small - which are actually quite perfect unless your planning to go in there with a hefty appetite. Service was fantastic, the guy even let us in on the happy hour deal early! Props to that with a perfect pint of beer! I decided a trip to Pies &amp; Pints was overdue when my friend told me she had been there 3 times in one week! The layout is a little different. There are lots of booths and high tables in the front, and a cozy bar (sans TV) with a pool table in the back. &#160;They have a great beers on tap, a good cider selection (STRONGBOW yeah!) and cans of &#160;Hamm's &#160;for $1.50! &#160;When the food came out I was skeptical that the pie was going to satisfy....I was tricked! Consider yourself warned! The pies are way more filling then they look! Pros:Killer pot piesStrongbowHappy Hour (any pie &amp; pint for $8.95)Cons:No TV in the bar for sports The pies are really tasty... sorta. They are smallish, but really, do you need more than that for a single serving? It's a good single serving. Maybe 4" across?From everything I've read in previous reviews, I found my experience there was much the same.I got the daily special "Chicken, Artichoke &amp; Vodka pie." It was good, but underwhelming. I wanted more flavor.Jesse got the "Mediterranean pie." LOTS of flavor. I was very impressed with his.Seems like the ones you get that pack a wallop are the Mediterranean and the Indian. I will try the Indian Curry pie next time. Also curious about the lamb and potato. Sounds perhaps a little bland, but I do love me some lamb.......The Caesar salad was pretty good. Nothing to write home about.The split pea soup was not good. It was so thick I could eat it with a fork. Or perhaps even a toothpick. Perhaps just a personal preference thing, but I like mine spoonable.
One of THE best pastries I've ever had. &#160;I don't even like sweets or pastries (a double whammie) and this place blew my mind. &#160;Imagine how a pastry lover would react if they had a taste of this gold (my girlfriend)... We had a chance to eat several of their pastries and my favorite would have to be the onion Gruyere. &#160;It was fantastic.The quiches here were also pretty good here, but nothing really knocked me out like the pastries. &#160;Definitely a must-visit place in Seattle for out of towner foodies like me! I freaking love coming here. Lately, I'm trying to do it once a week. Their croissants are easily the best in Seattle. As much as I love Bakery Nouveau in West Seattle and live much closer, I would rather have my pan au chocolat at Besalu. In fact, it's the best chocolate croissant I've EVER had anywhere. And that includes Paris. SERIOUS. The butter croissants are magnificent as well. Everything they have looks fab, but I seriously cannot do without the croissants. It's a small place so come early or wait to get a seat, take it to go, whatever. Just come in. They're only open Wednesday - Sunday from 7am-3pm. Plan accordingly. My recipe for a better life includes the following: come here 1x per week, meet a good friend, snag a table, get Americanos and and one of each croissant. Repeat. You're welcome. I lived in France for more than 2 years, and my wife is French, and we agree that their croissants are the most similar to the ones we found in Paris.Hella hella good. The lemon tart is divine! Light, flaky crust, perfect balance of sweet and tart...so delicious I ended up getting one more to go. I've been wanting to come here forever now and Cafe Beslau stands out as another bakery gem in Seattle. True, there was a line but don't let that deter you from trying one of the best croissants I've ever tasted. They do run a tight ship which I appreciate. There was always someone cleaning &amp; replenishing the pastry case/platter tray, the barista going down the line asking what you would like to drink so she can start the preparation, someone else starts grabbing the pastry once you tell them your order, &amp; someone ringing you up. And it's pretty cool to see the bakery action taking place behind the counter.The coffee was strong, the lemon tart delicious, the Lorraine quiche was pretty egg-y which I loved, onion gruyere pastry was nomtastic! And the croissant? Buttery and flaky :)They also provide a side of jam with the croissant which was perfect. The only pastry that didn't "wow" me was the hazelnut twist but that's ok because everything else was excellent.Service was friendly and because it's a small space, there isn't a lot of sitting/seating area so keep that in mind. My only wish is that Cafe Beslau was closer to home *sad panda face* I REALLY love the pastries here and the coffee is pretty damn good too. &#160;But seriously, the pastries are awesome. &#160;Be warned that you will most likely encounter a line (I'm talking out the door) at Besalu but it usually moves pretty quickly. &#160;If you have a little patience and a little time I definitely recommend coming here.Sooo good. This place is dangerous. Oh, the croissants... plain, almond, chocolate. All so good. Line out the door every morning, and rightfully so. I struggled to get up bright and early 6 am on a Saturday - an ungodly hour for any day. All for the glory of waiting in line for a fresh batch of heavenly Besalu croissants. It was so worth it and then some. My favorite Cappuccino and Pastry in Ballard!! Friendly staff and excellent food , super fresh and very tasty!! Feels like an European cafe, love it!! Limited seating, long lines at times but worth the wait! Undeniable and perfectly executed. You'll want to work through every item on the menu, though they're all variations on the same dough. Even the long and sluggish line somehow adds to the appeal. One of the best CROISSANTS I've had. &#160;Their CHOCOLATE CROISSANTS were fantastic too. &#160;Super flaky on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside. These are croissants done right. &#160;The bakery is fairly small and not a lot of tables to sit and enjoy your goodies but the people waiting in the long lines obviously don't mind. I was so excited. It was my first time visiting. I got plain crossaint w/ strawberry sauce. The croissant literally melted in my mouth. Line was 15 people long, but went quick. I ordered a piece of spinach and carmelized onion quice and was pleasantly surprised by the large portion. It was so fresh and rich. Best quiche I have tasted from a bakery. I enjoyed a croissant from here and I have to admit it was really good.
This is an awesome brunch spot, in a lovely neighborhood.The staff at both ways Cafe is friendly and serves up their coffee and pastries with a smile. &#160;I ordered the smothered potatoes, such a treat. Homefries covered in cheese, with bits of bacon, topped with sour cream can it get any better? &#160;Also, the waitress was too sweet, when I wanted extra foamy cappuccino she made me an extra special mug filled with my cappuccino and it was brimming with foam. Their house made seasonal jams are always great, and it's a perfect excuse to order up some toast of biscuits to smother it on. &#160;Such a wonderful neighborhood cafe. This is my go to place for breakfast and it is consistently yummy! Their biscuits are the Bomb and their staff is helpful, even when run ragged!Note that on a weekend, and especially on a Bike Sunday, this place is packed and there is little room to move. The sun shines directly into the front windows and it can get uncomfortably hot inside at times. So make sure you find a place to sit at one of the outdoor tables!!Try the jam they offer on all of their tables, it's sweet and tasty without being too sugary. Their coffee drinks are really well done (not always a given at a place that offers full breakfasts) and the pastry is to die for. I love their chicken sausage and it's always a struggle for me to decide whether to have bacon or the sausage when I decide to have eggs. Really like their Juevos as well.Do yourself a favor and try to get there early, if on a weekend, and often if during the week. Great folks, great food. Love it! Can't stop bragging about this place. This wonderful neighborhood cafe has a truly great scramble with fresh ingredients. To go or in house, this is not a place to missed. Next door to flying squirrel pizza. My recommendation is to get a breakfast burrito or breakfast sandwich and walk to the lake. Only complaint would be the slightly high end prices. Delicious. I love the biscuits and the service is super-friendly. A great place for a nice relaxed brunch. I used to like to slip in &amp; out of this place for my lunch hour and could squeeze back into work right on time. Its the perfect cozy neighborhood spot for breakfast or lunch. The havarti with spinach and the salmon scrambles are decadent and served with some perfect home fries and a biscuit that is to die for if you are so smart as to order one with your meal. I also get an americano because they taste good and because it helps to balance out the lunch coma I leave in. Just found this great little breakfast / lunch spot in a quiet neighborhood commercial district near Seward Park. &#160;We both ordered breakfast. &#160;I ordered the french toast with honey wheat bread and a side of chicken/apple sausage. &#160;The two large pieces of french toast were delicious! &#160;My partner ordered the two egg breakfast with home fries, bacon and a huge biscuit. &#160;Both meals were well worth the price. &#160;Staff was very attentive and friendly. &#160;We will be back! Best breakfast in the Mt baker, Columbia city, Seward park area in my opinion. Their biscuits and gravy are delicious and you can't go wrong with their daily breakfast special. The fried egg sammy is great for those who have a small tummy. The down side, for some, will be the service time. If you're ready to relax with family or friends this weekend breakfast stop is the choice. Great coffee. &#160;Foods better then expected. Not a lot of space to sit, but on nice days its great to sit out side. This is my favorite casual place to go for breakfast and conversation. &#160;It's simple, it's homey and I feel welcome. &#160;There is only one small issue but it won't change my rating: &#160;a particular wait staff just isn't on the ball they way the others are. &#160;One time we went in and sat in the big table in the middle of the restaurant. &#160;It was twenty minutes before someone came and took our order (it was moderately busy) and it wasn't even our server. &#160;When she came to us, we told her someone else came and took care of us. &#160;We managed to get one cup of coffee each. It wasn't the guy's fault--he was running around like crazy while at some point she was actually sitting down herself with a friend and eating in the cafe! &#160; Another time, same scenario: &#160;the guys working their butts off while this same server seems to be in the clouds--came and asked us if we wanted anything to drink and then walked off. &#160;We never received anything. &#160;Again--one of the guys stepped in. &#160; I love this place, though, but I try to avoid it when this staff person is on the floor.
I like these people, and I wish this was one of my favorite restaurants, but their approach to Greek-tinged Italian cuisine isn't particularly exciting. Their vegetable lasagna is pretty good, and their buttery Alfredo seems to lack cheese almost entirely. Prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is fairly comfortable and casual. I just haven't been particularly impressed.
This Taco Time is my favorite in the West Seattle area. &#160;I drive a little further out of my way to go to this one. &#160;They have the fancy soda machine here where you can get your choice of 100 different flavors of soda. &#160;I also like the fellow patrons. &#160;Good people watching while you're having lunch.The service is good and friendly. Just ate here and will have to say it was the nicest Taco-Time I have ever been to! The food was fresh and fast...Can't compare it to an actual Mexican restaurant but was definitely top notch for a fast food joint. I think My buddy Matt comes here specifically for the Modern fountain machine :).
I'm convinced this place needs to be on Guy Fieri's "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives", but don't know if it falls into any of the categories. El Puerco Lloron is just off the beaten path behind Pike's Market, hence not many tourists found here, save for those who are "in the know". And I never would've found out about it save for it was recommended by local Yelper Erik M. (shout out!).Having only one visit to enjoy the great authentic Mexican food here almost seemed like a crime. Not quite sure which dish to choose from, I asked the modest but not bi-lingual server if I should go with the Carnitas or the Tamales, and also asked how the Carnitas were served- in tortillas? Based on just asking, I guess she thought I was ordering the Carnitas.Counter Service here is kind of laissez faire, you order, can sit down, come back for a drink- do whatever you want! But for first timers, a little smile and direction would've gone a long way.The carnitas was really good, but I wouldn't have minded a tortilla or two to stuff it in. There's a do it yourself salsa cooler so I added some of the Hot Stuff to the pork belly meat. The colorful atmosphere at El Puerco is festive but certainly casual, tin tables and chairs, and Mexican wood carvings hang from the walls and ceiling. It's nice to know this exists, if you're wanting to get away from the crowds at the Market and grab some great authentic Mexican. This is definitely the best Mexican food I've had here in Seattle. It's the closest I've had to something my mom makes. If you don't like feeling like you're in Mexico when you eat then you won't like this. The decor is so true to Mexico's street food. I remember all of those tables and chairs being set up next to taco carts when I used to go visit. Nothing fancy about this place. I mean the menu is written on what almost looks like binder paper, but that's totally cool with me. They could use hieroglyphics for all I care, just keep making that awesome food. I had the chicken mole and my boyfriend had the carnitas. I almost didn't go because of some of the reviews saying this place was dirty and full of flies. I'm so glad my boyfriend made me go anyways. Again this place is not fancy, do not go expecting some where like Galerias in Capitol Hill. Go in expecting old run down furniture with lots of color and authentic home style Mexican food. Buen provecho! I thought it was called El Puerco Lloron because Kermit got into domestic violence. &#160;har! &#160;it's pretty good mexican comfort food served in a dingy place. &#160;it's like eating at someone's backyard but with really good mexican home cooking. &#160;none of that tex-mex, fancy neo-mex cuisine here. &#160;old fashioned chicken mole, hand pressed corn tortillas, beans, rice, the whole enchilada (speaking figuratively, of course). &#160;and enough food for lunch in your cube the next day.great place for a beer on the deck. &#160;great for tourist watching. &#160;but really, why the crying pig? &#160;maybe the pig realized how delicious he was going to be. &#160;and came to the conclusion that he can't eat himself. &#160;say, what if we humans, tasted great and no one knew about it but cannibals? &#160;If i knew i tasted like carne asada and i couldn't eat myself, i'd cry too. Everyone raves about the carnitas, and being a big fan of carnitas, I dragged the BF here to see for myself... &#160;And I wasn't disappointed!The tortillas were pressed and cooked right before our eyes. &#160;Could have gone without all the rice and beans, but for the price I felt okay not eating them all. &#160;The staff were friendly even though we came in close to closing.I love the colorful cantina ambiance. &#160;It's cute how there are little pig figurines all around. Great location, right off the middle of the hillclimb steps, so you will enjoy the lazy full-bellied stroll through the courtyards and fountains on the way back. &#160; We bought some chili pepper fiesta lights and a spanish techno (Polymarch) CD at the shop next door. Wow I loved this place, was just like any cantina in Mexico or even in Cali.Food is served hot, fresh tortillas, serve yourself condiments: salsas and pickled carrots, onions and peppers.Had the special Carnitas Colorado.... meat was so tender and just melted, rice and beans were exceptional &#160;if I didn't have to go back to work would have had a beer or 2! I have visited this place a couple times and have been very impressed with the consistent level of quality of both the food and the service. The best way i can put it is I felt like the meals I have had there have been specifically prepared for me like I was a family member over for dinner or a very welcome guest.The location is a little hard to find if you're not real familiar with the ins and outs of the Pike Place Market area but that's also part of the charm as you feel like you've made a discovery when you do find it. The prices are reasonable, the portions are generous, and you will love the rustic charm of the decor complete with pictures of various cultural celebrities . The food is VERY good at this place. My boyfriend led me here on Saturday and I was surprised and happy to find a place at Pike Place Market that is sort of hidden away from the whacky tourists and general hub-bub huddled near The Pig in the upper part of the market.I knew it was going to be good when I walked in the door and saw the woman expertly pressing the tortilla dough into the hand-press and throwing it onto the hot grill. Awesome.We hit it just right, because there were only 3 people in the place when we walked in, but within 15 minutes or so, a dozen more people came in and the place was over 2/3 full. Had the pork carnitas and the rice and beans were outstanding. Simple, perfect (not dry) and flavored as much as it needs to be. If you want more flavoring, hit the salsa bar (no flies on this Spring day) and try the carrots -- they've been swimming with the jalapenos so much, they taste hot and crunchy. Yum! I should mention that the whole green onion WAS on both of our plates, the guacamole was fresh and yummy and the chips were freshly-made.It does have a Mexico-type feel (casual, lived-in, I suppose if you're high-maintainance, the outside building and the windows and the cooking area are grimy-looking. Duh -it's a working kitchen. If you saw your favorite kitchens more often you'd probably be scared) - I should mention that the tabletops were clean, the dishes and plastic trays were clean), so if you need a more upscale restaurant design, then go Downtown.People in Seattle know where the good food is, and this is one of those places. Don't believe the negative hype. I strongly believe in supporting the small businesses in Pike Place Market. I quite like this place's spunk. &#160;It's down the stairs from Western Avenue (Below the Pike Place Market) and when I went it was valiantly trying to show Mexican warmth on a dark and rainy Seattle evening.Pluses: &#160; * Lots of bright colors and character &#160; * Decent prices &#160; * Good--but not amazing--food the one night I've been; I've heard it's among the more authentic in the city &#160; * Mexican Coke available (made with sugar, not high fructose corn syrup)Minuses: &#160; * Was a little cold inside the night I went &#160; * It's a bit hard to get to: I found a free spot on the street but parking is expensive and you'll have a bit of a walk if you take the bus from some other part of the cityOverall: Best on a summer day when you can sit outside and have a beer but probably not a bad place to hang out during Seattle's long winter and remember good times in warmer places. Disappointment #1737: Lloron, perhaps once a fiery, charismatic, sexy Latina who charmed everyone she met like the sensual, would-be Meh-hee-kan-o woman on the Kahlua commercials, now sits around apathetically in her hovel, wearing sweatpants, watching 16hrs of teevee a day, farting into her permanently-butt-shaped cushion crease, keen to let all of her body hair grow out. I never knew the good version (if it ever existed). Just this one with the discarded napkins and bits of food on the floor and tables and the bland, barely lukewarm food scooped out of typical buffet steam tubs and served up by a fed-up, surly lady. It has the air of having given up, but perhaps there was nothing to fight for to begin with and everyone's been wearing Kahlua goggles. Their one saving grace is homemade tortillas, but they're more of an apology. We went back with a living social coupon and even with the discount, I still do not understand where the raves are coming from. &#160;Tourists? &#160;The service is not friendly, food handling is not clean, the line is long, the food is hit or miss and i feel like my table is going to collapse. &#160;Overall, not a good experience. &#160;I just don't get it. &#160;I guess you can't get decent mexican food downtown or everyone is just brainwashed. &#160;I've had much better. While on a road trip around the country, a friend recommend that we stop here when we got to Seattle. Finding El Puerco to begin with was somewhat of an adventure, especially with being from out of town, but it was absolutely worth it! Upon entering you should look immediately to your right, otherwise you'll miss the entire menu! Be sure to get something with tortillas so that you can fully experience the freshness of ingredients used. Place your order and then watch the tortillas come to life right in front of you on the griddle, incredible! You won't find any crazy tex-mex, neo-mexican-fusion-asian-pan-blah-blah here. Just really good comfort food that will fill you up and make you feel relaxed. If you're in Seattle, you have to go here! Yelp actually helped me try this place. My husband wanted to come &amp; take me to lunch and wanted Mexican, not Chipotle or Blue Water (in my opinion these are not Mexican foods) He wanted authentic. Off to yelp I went and found this place. Their food did not blow me away but it was good for the price. We both had the Carne Asada, it was good and I loved that they served it with whole beans instead of re-fried. Their tortillas are hand made and were awesome. This place is a little hard to find but I loved the rustic feeling to it. Missed matched chairs and tables that looked like they came from a rummage sale. I would definitely go back here. Our 2 year even liked it! He loves tacos with hot sauce! My coworkers seem to love this place. Me: not so much. Great hole in the wall with cheap authentic food :) I had the Carnitas Colorado today and it was as good as it gets. &#160;Savory, melt in your mouth, goodness! &#160;The resteraunt itself is understated, and practically hidden, but an absolutely fabulous find!
I was going to watch a movie at SIFF but wanted to get there early to beat traffic but that would leave me close to two hours free. Getting some grub and a cold one would be a great way to pass the time. But where? I scoured the internet for an awesome happy hour and happen to stumble upon the Spectator's website. I found out it was a sports bar and shows every sport under the sun and they have happy hour fro 4:00 to 7:00. I called just to double check and since it was on Monday it was all day. Spectator, here I come!On Monday, with no particular exciting sporting event being shown, it was empty. Aside from me and the bartender two other guys drank their beer in silence. It is a nice sports bar. The sports bars I'm accustomed to are dingy with broken furniture and have a weird smell. This bar had clean furniture and lots of nice high definition tvs. I can see how this place could get crazy with a fan favorite team being shown on the boobtube. There are signs on the wall warning people only a certain number can sit in the booth. Six to be exact. I wonder how rigid that rule is. I cozy up to the bar and the bartender greets me and I order a drink. I spy the happy hour menu. Cheap well drink and beer specials. Food ranges from $3 to $6 with a variety of options under each price range. I order the fish sandwich and the tater tots. A great combination. While I am not any huge sports fan I couldn't tear my eyes away from ESPN. High definition television, hell, ANY television is hypnotic. My fish sandwich and tater tots are given to me piping hot. The sandwich was massive. I take a bite and oh man, this is good shit. The fish was fried and all sorts of greasy, the tarter sauce was yummy, and lettuce rounded out the experience. The tater tots were seasoned nicely. I ate happily and even continued when I knew I hit my stomach's max capacity. I enjoyed my time at the Spectator. I would not be there when an important game was on but on a dull Monday in the sports world I suggest going, at any time, to enjoy the all day happy hour and get that fish sandwich. Its insanely good! I had resisted going here for a long time, mostly because I am not a sports bar fan.However, going in for a happy hour special and on a non-sport specific night turned into a pleasant surprise.$2 Rainer beer cannot be beaten. &#160;They have a nice happy hour food menu, but I elected to for a sour dough burger w/bacon and Thousand Island dressing. &#160;Service was friendly and causal paced which was perfect for the Monday night I was there.If I were a sports aficionado, the 15, 30" or so flat screens hanging about the bar are easy to see from most places. &#160;There is the standard pool table. &#160;And though maybe not a dive bar by Xav's standards, it's certainly a pleasant "grungie" bar. This is my local bar for UFC fights. My boyfriend and I love going for every UFC fight and we sit in the same spot and we usually get Ron the manager for the early part of the night. We love going there they know us and we never ever spend more than $50 on two dinners and one of us drinks (usually the boyfriend). I also threw a surprise bday party for my boyfriend and they handled about 20 people fantastically and all right before a UFC fight.Pretty fantastic place if you ask me. (and well yelp did) Get the Edgar burger pretty yummy... Look this is 5 stars for a sports bar, this isn't a place to expect great food, 5 star service or delightful restrooms (although, I did find them satisfactorily clean) &#160;5 stars for:Great Bartender! &#160;Jessica was awesome. &#160;Dealt with my sarcasm like a seasoned pro and threw it right back. &#160;She even snuck around from behind the bar to play some Silverstrike with us. &#160;She lost and bought a round.Great Happy Hour. &#160;I was there for a while, 3-4 beers w/ Food and my tab was $12.As the name implies this is a great location to watch a game. &#160;There are literally HDTVs everywhere and whole space is sort of divided into smaller spaces to accommodate multiple groups of people watching various games, hockey on one side, basketball on the other...Soccer Fans note: They are open at 7a.m. for the World Cup!Now add that 4 star goodness to the biggest assortment of bar games I've ever seen in one location and you get 5 stars: &#160;Silverstrike Bowling (If you don't know now, ya know. &#160;50cts/gm) Big Buck Hunter (75cts/tour)Connect Four &amp; Other board gamesMs. Pac Man tabletop sets (Circa Pizza Hut 1988)Small Shuffleboard Table Ping Pong and Pool Table (Ping Pong's Free - Pool?) Love the 'Tator!Food - Hit or miss, depending on the menu item and what time of dayDrink - Thank you, miss, may I have anotherEnvironment - this place is rad, 360 degrees of TV viewing, awesome on football days! &#160;Or pretty much any other day that any other sport is televised. When the Packers aren't on network TV, this is my go-to place for the game, and in multiple visits, it has not once disappointed. It's not gourmet fare, but it is above average for a sports bar, especially the breakfast. When I first had their breakfast sandwich, I lamented the $5 cost of a glorified McMuffin when I ordered. By the time I finished said sandwich, I was ready for a serving of crow as well, because it was sooo worth the $5!Their service is pretty good, though it can slow down a bit when it gets really busy. And generally the clientele is friendly and not too obnoxious, unles you're rooting against them. And even then, it's in good fun!And I have to mention the wings, because that's my dish of choice. The 'Tator makes a great classic buffalo wing, Frank's Red Hot style, and I've order them at least a half-dozen times and never been let down.If you're up for a game and in QA, make the Spectator your destination. Nice flatscreen TV's all over the bar make this a great place to go to watch a game in QA. &#160;Beer selection could be a little better but its not too bad. &#160;More local micros would be nice. &#160;Food is decent, I'd say above average for bar food. This is what a Sports Bar should be. I avoided going in here, even though I like sports bars, because it feels pretty run down from the outside. I finally went for March Madness last year, and hey presto! It's a plenty nice place inside. The food is good bar grub. The beers are a good price. They serve beer in cold mugs. I've never had a bad experience with the staff at all. They're more friendly and accommodating than most places even when they're busy.Big thumbs up for the 'Tator. This is my bar of choice for after work sporting events. Unbeatable happy hour prices and TVs lining the walls so you can catch your game wherever you sit. I went for March Madness to watch the Huskies/Marquette game and it wasn't too crowded and there was a good, friendly vibe. Plus people got really into the game and it was fun to share in the excitement. Service is always friendly but every time I've gone I've had to really put in effort to flag someone down for a refill or walk up to the bar where it still takes a while to get noticed. Patience is a virtue and I think $2 beers are worth the wait. I love going for Thursday night football games and I'm thinking about coming to The Spectator for some MNF this year since it's always treated me well. I've always gone specifically to watch a sporting event so I've never played any of the games available in the bar but people look like they're having tons of fun and it looks like a good place for a group. It's a good atmosphere with no tension despite diverse fan allegiences. I watched an OSU/Oregon football game and was pleasantly suprised to see such well-behaved and good-natured Ducks fans (if you've ever been harrassed at Autzen stadium as a visitor you understand). I've also seen lots of different people in the bar ranging from die hard sports fans pounding Coors Light to casual viewers sipping white wines (to each his own!).It's a fun place and happy hour is priced right, check it out! This is one of my favorite bars in the city to just chill at. Some nights it can get really packed for a game, but others you can go in and sit at the bar with the regulars. The food is decent and the portion sizes are HUGE, the happy hour prices can't be beaten, and all the bartenders are fantastic! Plus between the TV's and the games to play you'll never be bored. Excellent sports bar in really cool neighborhood. &#160;The food the 2 times I have been there was great. &#160;Breakfast was the best I have seen in any bar ever. &#160;The drinks are reasonably priced &amp; poured strong. Staff was great. &#160; Not a big fan of the TV placement, but given the layout of the property, they seem to be hand-cuffed a bit. Good place to watch a game, food is ok. Overall I'm a fan. I went today to watch some Steeler football. This is part of my quest to find a place in Seattle at which you can watch any football game on good TVs, without being haggled over being a Steeler fan, while eating food that is somewhat good and not horrible for you. They had good, attentive service. It got pretty busy when the Seahawk game was about to start so it took a while for me to get my check, but that's to be expected. All the high quality TVs are labeled with the game(s) they will be playing, so you can plan accordingly. It does seem to get busy so you should get there 10-15 mins before your game starts to make sure you get a seat (probably a bit longer if the Seahawks are playing). They serve breakfast food during the morning NFL games. I asked for scrambled egg whites with my dish, but they "don't do that." But, I guess that's a bit much to ask from a sports bat. Bottom line: great place to watch the game; good unhealthy bar food.
They arrive within the time they say, the food is hot and delicious and in MASSIVE portions, the prices are really good and delivery is free. By far my favorite delivery place. GO AMANTE!Pros...- In addition to pizza they have pasta, sandwiches, dessert etc.- Pasta Puttanesca: Deeelish AND comes with salad + bread- Garlic Bread- just crusty/buttery /garlicky enough but not over the top- Drivers always have enough changeCons...- Italian dressing is super oily and not super awesome- usually takes 45 min. or so to arrive Sometimes being lazy is a good thing but than again sometimes it's not. &#160;With no food in the apartment and me already in my lazy clothes I decided to order something in. &#160;Sick of Chinese food, knowing the Mexican delivery placed closed and not having a menu of the Thai place that delivers I went with Amante, their menu is online. &#160;I decided on the white spaghetti which came with soup or salad and garlic bread and I also ordered the cheese bread, I was craving carbs don't judge me. &#160;Deliver was great they came within their stated deliver time and the driver was friendly. &#160;The spaghetti on the other hand was a mess it was all stuck together in one big clump, once I tossed it around a bit and heated it up a little it got better and so did the roasted garlic that I found in it. &#160;I order white spaghetti a lot, I'm boring like that sometimes, this was no where near the best but thankfully not the worst either, actually it's kind of what I expected for delivery pasta and the price was right. &#160;The soup was ok, a broth-y potato soup but the garlic bread was hard and ended up tearing the inside of my mouth apart biting in to it I was happy I ordered an order of the cheese bread that was soft and cheesy and the roasted garlic squashed on top was pretty good too. &#160;It provided plenty of leftovers so I still don't have to go grocery shopping just yet. Pretty good. &#160;We ordered delivery tonight and we were thrilled that they came down this far south in West Seattle (Fauntlee Hills). &#160;Even Pagalucci won't deliver to us! &#160;I ordered the Seattle's Favorite and a greek salad and we have lots of leftovers and fully stomachs. &#160;Yum-o!
Things to like about this place: homemade guacamole; 2 varieties of tasty salsa; real, live plants all around; service with a smile; purposeful vegetarian options (not always easy to find in a Mexican joint); sticky, sweet sopapillas; and a $7.95 buffet. For that price, it doesn't need to be 5-star. I'll be back! Amazing staff. Awesome atmosphere. The food sadly is not the best Mexican I've ever had. I only recommend this place for drinks and snacks. Great for large groups. Yeah every Sunday for the last 4yrs. Believe it. This place is kind of an odd duck as far as a 1-5 rating, so I guess it depends on what you want:Eating here? Pass. I've ... well, I've seen some interesting decisions being made here. My definition of a chicken quesadilla isn't a pile of chicken folded in a tortilla, then cheese sprinkled on top and thrown in the broiler. At least I think that's what it was. Either way the quality was nothing to write home about. Maybe if I'd already had a few drinks, which does bring me neatly to my second point.Drinking here with some friends? Yes. Great place to bring in a group of people, because their service has always been on the ball, friendly, and fast. Definitely the high point. Nobody I've been with has complained about their drinks, ever. This is in stark contrast to the food.The problem is, while their service is top notch, and their drinks are good, in the end it's a restaurant and I consider ordering food to be fairly important at a restaurant. I can get good margaritas with slightly worse service but unbelievably better food elsewhere. Their beans may be vegetarian, but the RICE IS NOT! It's made with chicken stock--veggies beware! Sunday night, we decided to try La Cocina &amp; Cantina for a quick bite. It was pretty busy! We decided to have Nachos and Mexican pizza. Both very good, but the portions were too big just for the two of us. We had not been here in a long time and we will definitely remember this place for our late snacks! I LOVE LOVE LOVE their Shrimp/Crab chimichanga. &#160;My friend LOVES their buffet.Always great service, always a place to sit and family-friendly. I stopped in for their buffet at 3:50 hoping I'd still made it as I know it's over at 4. The gentleman said sure and I was seated quickly. It isn't the best Mexican food in town but the staff is so friendly that I'll be back. Just like the SNL skit "I gotta have more cowbell" ---"I gotta have more chips!" &#160;I came here with a party of 4 and we finished our 1st basket of tortilla chips. &#160;When our server stopped by I asked if he could bring us more chips. &#160;He said the cook in the back couldn't make anymore. &#160;I gave him the "REALLY?!" look (confused and shocked)--the one where I'm thinking "Wow, I'm in a restaurant and they don't want to serve us food." &#160;He studied my facial expression. &#160;He was a good sport so he said "Hold on, I'll check in the back and see what I can do." &#160;Within 10 minutes he brought back freshly made tortilla chips. My wife and I stopped in here a week ago while walking around Capital Hill. &#160;We managed to walk in towards the end of the lunch buffet. &#160;The overall low rating was really a mixed review. &#160;I thought the price for the lunch buffet was very reasonable, probably even low for the type of buffet that was served. &#160;The food was a bit average. &#160;They served some thin tortilla chips that didn't have enough taste to it. &#160;I prefer the thicker chips that are well salted. &#160;The reason for my low rating is not because of the food or service, it was the men's bathroom. &#160;It was disgusting! &#160;I won't go into detail, but don't use the bathroom if you can help it. &#160;It I hadn't used it, I probably would have given this place a 3 or 4 star rating. Meh. &#160;That about sums it up. &#160;Wasn't good. &#160;Wasn't bad. &#160; Margarita was good. &#160;$1.50 charge for sour cream was a little excessive. &#160;Service was slow- we had a wait a bit for our check. Just average. &#160;I wasn't at all impressed. Love this place! &#160;Their menu is awesome, they prepare the food quickly and well, it's delicious, and the prices are good! You can't help but want endless amount of their tasty complimentary tortilla chips and two sauces they give you before your food arrives!I go there maybe once or twice per month and the staff always remember me, it's nice! &#160;My friend and I always go here to catch up because of their food and massive margaritas! I have never had a bad experience there and their food is great! They also have a huge margarita menu...and they have some great specials on different days of the week. Their enchiladas and burritos are tasty and full of flavor! &#160;If you want some great south of the border eats with friendly service and for a good price then check out La Cocina...and while you're at it, drink up on their margaritas because it's just about guaranteed that you will have some left overs to bring home!
My quest for eating healthy, this is my local spot on the go when I do not have time to make dinner or need a quick meal instead of fast junk food.I normally get the chicken teriyaki, combo with beef + chicken, yakisoba, tempura veggies, and Donburi. Yes, I know I order a lot...I have a fambam of four. Toshio's Teriyaki stands out because they leave the skin on the chicken...yum yum. The sauce and the salad dressing is addicting and I can drink it down like Gatorade. Yes, I am strange...I like the salad dressing on my chicken, too. lolBe sure to say Yes on the sauce on top of your rice. The portion is generous and the staff is very friendly.The space is very tiny so I recommend you calling your order in so you don't have to wait in the crowded space. If you are having a bad day...you can read the prayer pamphlets on the table or read the bible sciptures on the wall when you go pee. &#160;You found God while peeing in a Teriyaki joint?! &#160;Yes, you can....Great spot for fast chicken teriyaki instead of fast junk food. No excuse for unhealthy eating on the go when you can eat at Toshio's.Recommended. Same owners as kiku's in the u district and I must admit exactly deliciously. I loveeeee their chicken teriyaki, and Chicken yakisoba here!!! Plus the customer service is awesome!!!!! Yes, it is a bit americanized and it's like they break down their chicken with something dangerously addicting; like crack. &#160;But hey, they are always busy and their rice here is a perfect blend of mushy and fluffy :) perfect for my crave for their chicken teriyaki. Tip : Call in your order, it's easier that way and when you get there, you get your food right away and &#160;you can just sit there and eat if you want. But it gets too crowded to find a seat for more than two people. :( no bueno For a longtime now, I've been hearing good things about this place. That it is the best teriyaki in Seattle and everything. I literally have passed it a gazillion times but always felt it was a hassle to stop in because that area is so busy.I decided to give a try one day after leaving Chinatown since I didn't feel like driving into Georgetown. Not a big difference right? Well, Toshio's is more on my way home so..The place is fairly small as I would've imagined. Clean, simple design with some inspirational writing near the cashier. Interesting.Ordered the usual chicken teriyaki and some chicken curry. The teriyaki was super delicious. Chicken was cooked almost to perfection; moist, tender and flavorful. I felt like I have been getting mediocre teriyaki until I came here. The chicken curry on the other hand, not so good. Okay, when I think of chicken curry from a Japanese place, I think of mild spice, carrots, potatoes, chicken in a thick sauce. What I got from here tasted like Indian curry, maybe Chinese, bland sauce poured over chicken. It was pretty gross. I make better chicken curry..A lot of people seem to like it here so it gets busy with to-go orders and inside orders, so be a little patient. The teriyaki is really damn good so give it a try. Service was okay, just about what you'd expect from any teriyaki joint. My favorite teriyaki place in all of Seattle! Their chicken is unlike any other. Not the flimsy pieces that other places serve, but actual strips of a chicken filet with skin still on! And it's lean! Also, love the gyoza and yakisoba. Their noodles are the perfect texture and the flavor is amazing.I've been coming here for over 2 decades! Even though they've changed owners, the food is still the same. Absolutely fabulous for quick and convenient take-home meal! This is the best teriyaki in town. &#160;They use dark meat with the skin on which creates the most tender, juicy chicken you've ever had from a cheap teriyaki joint. &#160;Their sauce and salad dressing are absolutely perfect and just the right thickness. &#160;Make sure to ask for sauce on the rice and once you've finished your salad dip your fork-fulls of rice into the salad dressing for an added treat!Are you wondering why such a great review would only get 4 stars? &#160;Well, let me tell you... &#160;There is more religion in this store than in any church, evangelical included, I've ever been in. &#160;Luckily, they don't verbalize any god spewing at you, it's all visual. Everywhere. You can't NOT see religion in here.But, since the staff is very friendly and the food is spectacular, I will continue to be a regular. Hot damn this is good teriyaki. &#160;Menu selections are very straightforward and there are pictures up on the walls if there's something you're unsure of. Had the chicken and gyoza combo and was absolutely blown away. &#160;Srsly. &#160;Blown away. &#160;I'm not the biggest fan of chicken skin unless its cooked to a crisp. &#160;Didn't find that here but I still ate it because I wanted more. &#160;Again, the whole "thorough" eater thing. &#160;The place has been done recently and has new ownership. &#160;Good thing, because the last time I was here years and years ago, it was just a shack that served meat and rice with some sauce on it. &#160;It was good. &#160;But not good like this. &#160;It is also more religious than I remember. &#160;It's not in your face, but it's definitely there. &#160;So if this is something that turns you off, I'd suggest maybe you either take your order to go or just go somewhere else. &#160;But if you're cool with that, place your order, cop a seat, and get ready for your taste buds to experience a fiasco of flavor not seen before! I. Love. Toshios. I'll drive 30 minutes for some of their delicous teriyaki and some good mojo from their home-made posters. It's so good I usually don't get home with any as I've scarfed it down on the drive home. I've been eating here for about 8 years, and I've never been disappointed. Their food is consistently delicious, hot, fresh and CHEAP. Their regular chicken is cooked skin on--and I usually get that but pick the skin off when it is time to grub down. While it isn't super healthy to eat, it does get the chicken really nice flavor and keep it juicy. Don't forget to ask for sauce on the rice if you want it. The staff are probably the best part--whether I was there last week or last year, they always remember my face, and my order, and take a few minutes to catch up. If you haven't checked them out, DO IT. This is something that needs to be on your bucket list for sure! Service wasn't the best i had but it is a teriyaki place so what do i expect, right?? Its really busy around 8. first i wanted to say, i find one of the reviewers below hilarious.exact quote "Whoever said this is the best teriyaki hasn't had much teriyaki." &#160;followed by... "I was with two other people, and we all ordered chicken yaki soba."dont get me wrong, i LOVE yakisoba and order it religiously but how can you judge a teriyaki restaurant based on only trying their yakisoba and for that matter, only once? &#160;sounds like YOU havent tried much teriyaki.but anyways, back to the actual review. &#160;toshio's is a solid 4 star teriyaki. it's not the best teriyaki ive ever had but it is pretty good and in a unique way. &#160;the unique part is what separates toshio's from all the other edible 3 star teriyakis on every block in seattle. &#160;however they still have a ways to go before they get rated a 5 star teriyaki joint... starting with the yakisoba like mentioned above =) Tried twice but didn't enjoy it. Skinless good quality chicken would be so much better...and the rice was drowned with their sauce. Feel bad for giving a mom and pop resty a better rating but it is what it is. I love Toshio's Teriyaki. The chicken teriyaki is always cooked right. It hits the spot everytime. tasty, dependable, friendly service, fast (but not so fast that you worry your foods been sitting under a heat lamp). It was love at first bite! &#160;I only speak of their teriyaki chicken. &#160;I wanted to go back for more but it was labor day and they were closed. &#160;I guess it'll have to be next time! I agree with everyone that the owners are super friendly. &#160;But the teriyaki is not great (the sauce is too sweet for my taste--I lived in Japan for a number of years and still haven't found just the right sauce here in Seattle). &#160;On my neighbor's recommendation, I tried the curry chicken today and &#160;was pretty grossed out. &#160;The curry itself was good, with an extra ginger-y kick. &#160;But the chicken was disgusting. &#160;I think it must have been frozen for a good long time before it made its way onto my plate. &#160;It had that look to it that frozen meat does when you cook it ... come to think of it, I'm not even sure it was chicken. &#160;No flavor.The gyoza was good, but not spectacular.I was really hoping to be impressed, since this is in my neighborhood and so many people seem to like it. :-( I could eat here every day of the week.. Too bad they are closed on Sundays. &#160;I order the Chicken with the Skin on and ask that the Salad dressing and Teriyaki sauce is put over everything including the rice, salad and meat. &#160;BEST TERIYAKI IN SEATTLE!!! The Chicken Udon is made to order and the broth is some of the best I have ever had. &#160; The only complaint i have .. is that they recently remodeled and i wish they would have reconfigured the area where customers wait in line as they come in the door &#160;it gets backed up.. but even with that.. I will continue to be a regular customer My favorite teriyaki place. i've only tried the chicken teriyaki, but that's good enough for me. The chicken is tender and moist and the best part is the crispy skin. Not thin and dry like most places. YUMMM! Toshio's is a great teriyaki place. Everything is always fresh, and they use good cuts of meat for their dishes. Every time I go in there for take-out, it's always packed! I love the spicy beef teriyaki, no salad and sauce on the rice. The salad, to me, is a waste of space because it's nothing more than iceburg lettuce with some runny mayonnaise concoction they use as dressing. And let's face it, you're there to get teriyaki, not a good house salad. My boyfriend likes the plain old chicken teriyaki. I've had the yakisoba there once, and it had a different twist to it but was tasty. They do charge 25 cents extra for hot sauce, and you will get hit with a card fee of like 50 cents if you pay with credit or debit. The portions are healthy, so you actually do feel like you're getting your money's worth. The staff is nice, and while you're there you'll get serenaded with Christian pop/rock music playing in the background, if you're into that sort of thing! If you're in the neighborhood and have a hankering for teriyaki, go to Toshio's first.
Very ordinary and a long wait! The beer selection looked good though. Quality food, so-so service. &#160;Lucky at the time, I was so hungry, wet and tired that I didn't care about the service. &#160;All I wanted was a decent sized steak, and this place delivered. &#160;Food arrived very quickly, and it was tasty. &#160;If I went back, it would be for another steak.The service was very, "Wham bam, thank you ma'am". I really like the space and the feel of this bar. If service wasn't slow and if the food wasn't overpriced (albeit, good), I'd imagine I'd come here a lot. Great place for breakfast after having a long night out. We both had some great scrambles full of veggies and lots of potatoes on the side with a ton of toast. The only bad side is that sometimes you have to wait (we waited 10 minutes at the most) and the waitress seemed really stressed out, but it didn't effect our service.Overall, another great breakfast place. Sure looks like a great place: warm and charming decor etc... and great location, but the service here is consistently lousy. I first went there 4 years ago; vowed never to go back after some of the most unpleasant waitress I've ever had. Decided to give it a chance 2 years ago. Food took one hour to come out and it wasn't busy. Just tried it today again and same story (although I understand that they are short-staffed because of snow. Foods so-so. Maybe I'll try them again in a few years You pass this place and think to yourself - wow, pho-greasy spoon. &#160;Then you go in, order a mediocre breakfast from a waitress that couldn't care if you live or die, and you think to yourself "this isn't pho-greasy spoon, this is greasy-greasy spoon". &#160;I have to believe that this place stays in business only because it is relatively cheap and a good place to help cure your hang over with a little hair of the dog and a lot of lard. To me, it's your typical Seattle style cafe with brew. &#160;But, somehow it's just the right place if you want to be well fed with good portion of comfort foods. &#160;We've been there for lunch and I'd have to say they do breakfast right.They don't take group reservations which doesn't make it convenient, for us paying customers, nor for them... Eggs sort of over medium, hot links, and fruit for ~$10? &#160;This was totally over priced, under-quality food. &#160;And yet the large place was full of people. &#160;I don't understand that--this was the first time I went, and I'm never going back. &#160;Maybe everybody who comes in is a first timer, and they've just got a steady stream of newcomers to offset the terrible food, high prices, and manipulative/aloof waitstaff (though my busser was attentive and friendly--the waiter's the one I'm talking about). Going out to a weekend breakfast is in my top three things I love about weekends! &#160;Lets face it you are sharing breakfast most likely with someone you share or shared a bed with or someone who helped paint the town the town red purple or rainbow (however it is you roll) the night before. &#160;Or as I learned on this breakfast journey you could also be with your boyfriend's out of town family. &#160;So breakfast is normally fun as you get to rehash the funny and exciting things the night before, perhaps learn someones last name (jokes jokes), or make dreamy eyes at one another. &#160;All that is needed for this bliss to happen is eggs, meat and potatoes. &#160;I was sorely disappointed in the hashbrowns and this is part of the triangle of breakfast bliss so it is a major let down. &#160;The bacon was thick and yummy. &#160;They have a mile long list of scrambles and omlettes. &#160;However, I was peeved that they would not let me have one piece of sausage and one piece of bacon instead of having to chose one or the other. &#160;I mean why can't I, it's not like your not cooking both already?!?!?!? &#160;I was out to breakfast with a duo of negativity and rudeness and dammit I needed bacon AND sausage to get me through it and you Blue Star let me down!But if you are an omelet person and don't need bacon and sausage to make you happy then perhaps this is the breakfast place for you. &#160;I however will be back to frequenting the Brown Bag and Endolynes ! Don't go to Blue Star if you're hungry. &#160;We went there on Saturday around 11:30 and didn't get food until 12:30. &#160;The busser got our drink order but then the snail-pace server didn't even greet us for another 20 minutes. &#160;I ordered some toast to come out before our food arrived because I was starving by this point and the server brought it out WITH the meal! &#160;Plus she never brought two other things that we ordered. &#160;No one came to the table to check on us. &#160;We felt like we were in the twilight zone...does anyone see us here? &#160;On the bright side, the food was terrific. &#160;I ordered a special quiche-type dish and it was made of fantastic cheesy goodness. &#160;If I go back, I'll make sure to eat before-hand in preparation for painfully slow service. It's Happy Time!A group of 10 of us went here and had some beers and appetizers ($2.95 each!) for about $8 apiece. Granted, the nachos were a little wimpy and the quesadillas were nothing special, but they were good for the amount we paid for them. The server was sweet, though, and gave us samples of the new pumpkin ale they had just tapped. Our food and drink orders always arrived promptly. I guess that's what happens when you show up at 4:00 on the nose and are the first people there, though. Anyway, I feel marginally cheerier now than I did before walking in, so I'd call it a success. It's a miracle, too, because after spending the afternoon traveling around Seattle via public transit, I wasn't sure I'd ever smile again. I really liked this place when I first moved back to Seattle after college, but it has slowly lost some of it's appeal over the years as I have moved on to better breakfast joints in the city, but there are a few good things I still like about it.1. The Bloody Marys - delicious, spicy and a perfect hair of the dog.2. Coming here for breakfast/drinks before a Husky Game and walking across the street to catch the 44 to the stadium.3. Grabbing a couple of pints in the evening - a decent tap list and not too crowded, perfect for two or three people and a good conversation.The rest of the food is decent but nothing to write home about. At least give it a try because it is a good local business that has been around for a while and they do try hard and provide good service even when they're swamped. One of the things that I really enjoy about Seattle is that it is not overrun with chain stores. &#160;The community seems to be so supportive of individually run, independant restaurants and stores. &#160;How refreshing to be in a town and not see Denny's and IHOPs all over the place!I am admittedly a HUGE breakfast fan! &#160;LOVE IT! &#160;With that said, I rarely go out to eat for breakfast. &#160;Always too much going on, and not being a morning person, I only get out early if I absolutely have to. &#160;So when I do get an opportunity to meet for breakfast I am super psyched!Eggs Cetera's was suggested to me by a local friend. &#160;She had actually never been herself, but had heard it was good. &#160;Luckily she got there early to put our name in as it was a Saturday at 11am and they were doing quite a bit of business. &#160;Service seemed a little slow but not outrageously bad.The food was good without being spectacular. &#160;Great portions and fairly tasty but nothing significant. &#160;Just good old, down home goodness. &#160;My big shocker though...NO PANCAKES ON SATURDAYS!!?? &#160;As the waiter explained to me, they don't have enough grill space for pancakes on super busy days. &#160;Crazy! &#160;Whoever heard of a breakfast place without pancakes? &#160;But once i got over that initial shock, I went for the omelette and all was good.Given the choice for breakfast again, I would probably choose another spot in search of greatness, but I certainly wouldn't turn down an offer to eat here again if it was suggested. Just have to echo what others have said. Quality food I had BAD service.Went for a late B-fast on Sunday at like 12:30 sat down right away. I was surprised that there was no line...The place has a nice feel to it - seems like it would be a fun bar - while we were waiting for our food my friend and I were checking out the drink specials. Took a bit for them to get us some coffee no worry, but there we sat for quite awhile and after WAY to long I asked the guy who seated us If someone could take our order. A few minutes later our server came out. ( I am not one of those jerky people who make a big fuss when I don't get immediate service but also I am not going to wait quietly for someone for a hour either) There was this young couple who got seated right before us and they were still sitting there with their menus open after we ordered....OK so the food was great (ya it wasn't that cheap either - but not a rip off). I had an omelet with green peppers onions and about half way through I realized that there were small pieces of sun dried tomatoes YUMMM. My friend had a chef's salad (it was after noon after all...) the lettuce was mostly iceberg but it had carrots and red cabbage and the greens were really fresh.So here is where it all went down hill. My friend had ordered a side of fries. When the server brought out the food she did not bring the fries. We reminded her of that. There is no divider between the kitchen and the dining area. so about a quarter of the way through the meal I noticed a dish up on the rail under the heat lamps. I took until about three quarters of the way through our meal for her to bring them out. No apology or anything. It was the worst service I have had in a restaurant in a LONG time.Blue Star would be a great place if the could get their people working together and get some servers who are interested in taking care of their customers. I went here the other morning and it was okay. &#160;I felt like it was a bit pricey for the quality of the food, but I guess the location isn't cheap(45th and Stone Way). &#160;I had the special, which that morning was 'norweigan' pancakes and eggs and meat. &#160;Nothing terribly special, a bit better than an IHOP usually is but it's not anything I probably couldn't do myself. &#160;The service was really good, our waitress was in a really good mood and kind of a jokester and that counts for a lot. &#160;There's nothing more dreary than dreary people serving you. &#160;So props for that. Went here with friend for Sunday lunch. They were low on ice and only gave it to people who paid for drinks and not water, I was like QFC is up the street, get ICE! I didn't really say it but I was mad! food was tasting funny so we paid and left... I KNEW IT! I was feeling sick sick sick! my intestines were teaching me a lesson! Sorry for all you suckers who go there. I've been here for breakfast before and was impressed with the portion sizes for a cafe in a city over a small town diner. However, we had 2 servers that shared our table, and I assume did not communicate with each other. It actually seemed that the entire staff may have been recovering from a serious bender the night prior, judging by the blank stares we got from one of our servers. Anyhow, we had to remind them of missing items from our order a couple of times and had to chase them down to pay. When one came back with our bills to sign, she angrily threw the black folder on the table and kept walking. The food was good; the service, not so much. Like several other people on here, I thought the food was decent and the service was sad. I've been a waitress for almost 3 years, but even people who aren't in the business would probably be dismayed at the lack of attentiveness and organization the staff exhibits. We were asked no less than 5 separate times if we wanted coffee refills in less than 10 minutes, and each and every time the answer was NO. The servers appeared distracted, wandering around absent-mindedly while people waited by the door for a table--one group even walked after being ignored. Overall, the staff was perfectly nice, but they didn't seem to have their act together at all--and they messed up our relatively simple order. A prescription to fix this service mess? Assign servers SECTIONS (then 5 waitresses wouldn't be wandering around offering coffee repeatedly to everyone a billion times), hire a hostess or assign someone to watch the door so customers don't wait or leave in annoyance, and repeat orders to customers before handing them in to the kitchen. I mean, really. If they were slammed this would've been way more understandable, but they were not that busy.Overall...meh. So much potential for improvement! A competent manager or lead server could probably turn this place around easily.
Giving this place 5 stars is a bit excessive when you have to pay $95/person and then have to pay extra if you want the special catch of the day or any of the other 2 desserts on the menu, such as the chocolate lava cake. &#160;Basically, for $95 your dinner and tip is included. &#160;However, what they don't tell you until you get on the boat and look at the menu is that none of the appetizers are included in that fee, 2 out of the 5 main courses are not included in that fee and only 1 of the 3 desserts are included in that fee (cheesecake). &#160;You also get a choice of seafood chowder or a salad with raisins and oranges and candied walnuts in it. &#160;I opted for the chowder because fruit in my salad is not a salad to me. &#160;In addition, if you want ANY sides to your main course, such as sauteed mushrooms, scampi prawns, or 1/2 lb of king crab legs, expect to pay extra on top of the $95 you already paid. &#160;That's a total scam if you ask me. &#160;If $95 includes your meal, EVERYTHING on the menu should be included in the price. &#160;The choices of the main courses weren't even that good (vegetable ravioli, chicken with crab on top or salmon). &#160;What if you want beef? &#160;Well you have to pay extra, which I did for a steak. &#160;Our waiter only had to wait on 5 tables, yet he was slower than slow and was not helpful in any way. &#160;We had to ask for someone to come over to take our drink order and all the other tables ordered their main course while we were eating our appetizers. &#160;We probably waited 30 minutes before our food even came out. &#160;We constantly had to ask for more hot water for my parents' tea and refills on coke, etc. &#160;In addition to that, our soups and appetizers were lukewarm. &#160;There was a live band on board, but they sang a lot of cheesey songs. &#160;I will say that the woman performer was good and much better to listen to than the male singer. &#160;It was also nice that she went around to every table to acknowledge any special occassions/celebrations. &#160;The two stars are for the fact that we did have a nice view of the city, even if the Captain never told us what we were looking at. &#160;The other star is for the fact that the band did play a song for my parents' anniversary and they got to do the Cha Cha Cha on the dancefloor and show up the stiff couple on the dancefloor.The food wasn't terrible, but for more than $95/person, you can get an amazing meal at a place like Ruth's Chris and at least you know what you get going into it. &#160;It was an experience and I was with my family so we made the most of it, but otherwise, I wouldn't waste my money on something like this.
Interesting cruise to go on. I highly recommend it.The seating outdoors is safe, the view is really nice.The driver doesn't make you fell like your about to fall off either!
Wow - what a pit.............. Drove by in the morning and say the sign for bahn mi $2.99 - sounded good. &#160;Not available in the morning (lots of places that serve bahn mi's start selling them at 7am) - guy was apolagetic and nice about it. &#160;Most likely won't be back.........
It doesn't matter what time we stumble in, it's open. That's all I need to know. To Go boxes in fridge the next afternoon usually tell me what happened the night before. If it's loaded with food, it means I was too and should have just told the driver to keep heading home. &#160;Uh, no. Let's order some prawns instead. Bedtime can wait. Yeah lackluster service as with 95% of the ID restaurant, so to be expect? &#160;One of the best Honey Walnut Prawns if you're into that. &#160;They tried to repaint the place pink? -- Still no go in terms of cleanliness, sticky table. &#160;Check out how the table are wiped down, now that's a show on it's own. &#160;All in all decent food, nothing stood out really, and the rest on par with a typical ID restaurant on the rest. This review is for the dim sum only. I was pretty disappointed...they did not have taro dumplings here! Instead they have this mushy, slightly sweet taro paste inside a fried layer of something. Bleh. The food was average and not very memorable. The only dishes that were good were the egg tarts and this BBQ pork stuff inside a moon-shaped flaky crust. Go across the street to Purple Dot Cafe for dim sum instead. Ever since I've ben introduced to Jade Garden, I haven't come back. &#160;The food is ok at best, their dim sum is decent (better than house of hong), but I would only come here if I were either A) drunk or B) dragged out to eat. This was my favorite Chinese &#160;Restaurant in Seattle when I studied @ UW. &#160;I always order their fried rice and chow mein. &#160;They're always open late at night so after a Mariners/Seahawks game. My mom has an affinity to Honey Court because my grandmother used to run a restaurant in the same location years and years ago. &#160;I was yet to be born when all this happened, but I have been to honey court plenty since then. &#160;They're open late and they aren't the most glamorous place, but the food is great. &#160;They have my favorite brisket noodle soup since King Cafe closed down, and they have great honey walnut prawns. &#160;They serve white rice in a thermos to keep it hot... ghetto, but works fine for me. &#160;The dimsum here is fine, but in order to get the perfect dimsum experience, I feel you have to go to 3 different places for specific items to get your fix, which is fine in Chinatown because everything is within walking distance and you go from waiting to eating in 3 minutes in most cases. &#160;They serve congee here with the donut, so ask for it if you feel sick or it's a cold day.
The reviews were pretty good for this place so I thought I'd give it a shot. &#160;1)It's overpriced. &#160;I got the chicken/beef combo with an eggroll and it was $11. &#160;Not really worth the price.2) The beef was terrible. &#160;It was like a hamburger patty on a stick with little teriyaki sauce even covering it.3) The chicken was okay. &#160;Not good, not bad, just okay.Overall, I wouldn't recommend it based on the price. &#160;Yoshino on first and capitol hill is more cafeteria style but tastes quite a bit better and is $4 cheaper.
Our late night yelp prom group congregated here to end the night. They tried to accommodate all of us in one section but we ended up in patches all over the restaurant. &#160;A large majority of us just waited till the parties around the main table left.We ordered foods that consist of. Bread with a lavender goat cheese dip. vegetarian patty with vegetables. Tuna tare tare and a few ordered burgers. The rest just drank like fishes. &#160;Lively conversation all around. &#160;Seeing and meeting new yelpers for the end of the party.Service was attentive as they provided us with filled water glasses and more liquor. &#160;Checks were all separate and no hassles.A great way to end a glorious night. Lucky for their late hours. 2 stars for the rude host/staff4 stars for our actual waiter who was great5 stars for the ravioli and fondue3 stars for the burger4 stars for the atmosphereAdds up to 3.6 stars, which is just ever so slightly closer to 4 than 3. But the service was so rude in some cases that I did consider bringing it down to 3 anyway. The good parts about our food and service were so good. But there were some truly iffy components to both of those aspects of our experience. &#160;THE GOOD:+ Goat cheese and lavender fondue. This was delicious. I cannot wait to come back here and eat this again. The cheese was melty and warm and lavendery and... I am craving it already. They should give more cheese for the amount of bread they provide (and I hope they don't respond by giving less bread!!!) + The ravioli appetizer. Even the "small" was a rather generous portion. And these were definitely in the "fluffy pillows of heaven" category of food. The sauce was delicious. The pasta texture was perfect. I also cannot wait to come back and eat this again. + Our server was extremely friendly, accommodating, and pro. HE was great. (All other staff were jerks.)+ I liked the decor here: chandeliers, large oil paintings, dark. It's very beautiful and feels well-balanced and warm. + Our giant group came in unexpectedly and they managed to find us all seats and get us our food rather quickly!THE BAD:- The rude hostess or waitress who snapped at my friend for nursing a bottle of Gatorade. Girl dragged herself out with us after a bout of food poisoning, and was carrying around electrolytes. She was one among many and we are all purchasing food and drink... seriously, you had to be a nasty b* about this? &#160;Surely at some point in life you have had to uphold a social obligation when you weren't feeling well. Whatever happened to a professional and polite, "I'm sorry, but we don't allow outside items due to [kosher, halal, or health department regulations, AKA the only 3 acceptable reasons for the forbid.] Can I provide you with *insert alternative here*?" We have both worked in bars/restaurants for way too many years to have any patience for outright, unnecessary rudeness.- The burger. Ok, the burger was not "bad," exactly. It's just that it was $15 and forgettable. Whereas I've just eaten the $8 and OMG-OMG-OMG-DELICIOUS burger at John Howie and the $5 DELICIOUS burger at Jak's. &#160;So it was a letdown. &#160; &#160;- My sad, watery excuse for a Dark &amp; Stormy. &#160;I'll consider this a "Stick to the wine" place. &#160;Which is perfectly fine with me because I'm sure it's good here.- The super stellar Tom Douglas donuts are not on Palace Kitchen's menu. Boohoooo :( The bad things were more like minor annoyances, so now that I know what to avoid I can just do so. The good stuff was good enough to make me look forward to returning for the sake of the food... but I'll prepare for mostly rude service (unless we get the good waiter again.) OVERRATED!Go for the bar drinks, not the food. &#160;I just don't get this place's appeal, I've been 3 times for food and have been disappointed each time except for the free pistachios at the bar. &#160;The bar is really cool with great martinis, a good beer selection and a good wine selection. &#160;People rave about the plin, I was not a fan but maybe I just don't like plin... &#160;The cheddar fritters were so-so. &#160;The slow roasted pork had way too many flavors/spices, I couldn't taste the pork. &#160;The lamb sausage was also really really rich. &#160;I guess if you like your foods natural flavors masked by lots of spices you'll enjoy The Palace Kitchen, I didn't. &#160;Pros: &#160;Great ambiance, friendly fun waitstaff. &#160;Awesome bar.Cons: Too many flavors infused into the food.UPDATE: Okay, I gave this place another chance and had a decent meal. &#160;I liked the plin! &#160;Maybe last time I was there on a bad plin day? &#160;I still think the food could improve more but the bar itself is worth going in for and my friend's liked their meals. Expect to wait for a table at this place. &#160;My wife and I arrived at 9:30pm on a Friday and still had to wait for 20 minutes. &#160;Don't worry, however. &#160;It was well worth the wait.We ordered the duck crepes, mussels and rotisserie chicken. &#160;Everything was absolutely excellent! &#160;Perhaps the best rotisserie chicken I ever had. &#160;Great ambiance, with high ceilings and a beautiful wall painting. &#160;Excellent service to boot.GO here! Review for Triple Coconut PieStopped by, got seated, then the waiter kindly packed up the pie for takeout. I felt bad making him set the table, but he wasn't a dick about it.There was a flaky but flavorless if not overbaked crust, with a schmear of custard and lots of untoasted coconut mixed in, and at least two inches of whipped cream. The latter was misleading. Toasted coconut on top. The general texture was toothy as I had to chew layers of coconut.I liked how the coconut meat wasn't sweetened and wasn't all toasted. However, I would have preferred there to be more custard and for it to be coconut flavored. If it was, I didn't taste it. For a small, but tall slice of whipped cream, it was overpriced at $8. The restaurant is also in a kind of scary area under the monorail with nothing else open around it. Not sure if Seattle has Marie Callender's, but I would seriously save my money for their yearly sale on pies instead. We were here last night - again. Listen, it's restaurant week and all. We agonized over whether we *should* do the 3 courses for $25 bucks, but just couldn't deviate from our favorites. &#160;We had an amazing meal and some of the most patient and helpful service I have ever had anywhere. It's worthy of singing the praises of Palace yet again.What made the night was that the service was excellent, as always. We were totally indecisive last night over EVERYTHING... appetizers, dinner, wine, dessert, etc. Our server was completely patient and helpful. I mean, he went above and beyond. We were so incredibly (unintentionally) annoying last night - and I would have hated to have been the one waiting on us. If he was annoyed he didn't show it at all. He is a saint, or something of that variety.FOOD: He assured us the prix fixe menu was the standard sized portions and an amazing deal, but he was also supportive of our decision to back-out of that and switch back to our favorite orders for dinner and appetizers. Wine: WHICH BOTTLE TO GET?? We usually go with a certain Pinot Noir, but we wanted to live dangerously. But not too dangerously, because we wanted something close. After narrowing it down to Tempranillo, the server gave excellent and accurate guidance on the differences between the Spanish one and the WA vintage. He was right on. DESSERT: Again, we could not decide. We were encouraged to try something new along with a guarantee that if we didn't like it we could have the old favorite. We had the peanut butter chocolate mousse. It was amazing. We requested extra peanuts on top (because we are pains the asses like that) - and there were plenty. It made the dessert that much better.All that being said, GO HERE while yuo can if you want to try Palace on the cheap. The prix fixe menu is good and has a lot of the standards. Or just go anyway. Anytime. I am quickly realizing I don't like Tom Douglas restaurants. First of all because they are not as good as everyone thinks they are but have the attitude as if they were. We came here after Yelp Prom and had a variety of stuff. We started with the goat cheese and lavender fondue. It was actually pretty good but the cheese only lasted about half way into the plate. Booo hiss! Then we had the ravioli appetizer. This was probably the highlight for me. The sauce was great and although we ordered the small plate it was actually a reasonable portion. And then the burger. Talk about what should be a $7 burger. My dad uses better meat to make the burgers he barbecues at home. The burger was also lacking bacon and the lettuce, onion, etc. didn't make it memorable. Boo for a burger that costs twice what it should. For drinks I just had water but tried my friend's dark and stormy. It was horrible. On top of that our group got a lot of attitude. They couldn't be bothered to bring chairs to an empty table so we could seat more people but were happy to yell at us when we did. And all of the staff we interacted with besides our server just generally sucked. Luckily our server was very nice and capable or this would have been a one star review. The interior of Palace Kitchen is cool but I don't see many reasons to come here. Had the salmon, served on mashed potatoes swimming in what looked like clarified butter. Topped with a mixture of Manila clams and capers, the flavor was pleasantly unique, but perhaps not $27 worth of unique. The meal was tasty, but the value proposition was off. I don't know if I'd come back as there are so many other places in Seattle to get amazing salmon for a more reasonable price.Service was good Stopped in late night for some cheese and tea. &#160;The selection was good and the service was great. &#160;I'd like to come here next time for an actual dinner, but not a bad spot for an apr&#232;s Canlis snack/drink.Some strange and rowdy people stumbled in, but they took care of it. &#160;Too bad I didn't even notice! Our server was great. He managed to keep his cool on a very busy Friday night and be charming, even smiling and not confuse any of our orders. The rest of the staff at Palace was downright hostile. they balked at allowing us to add extra chairs to our table, even speaking to a friend in sharp tones, and looked at each newcomer as though they were a job to be done, not a guest, not even a tipper! The food was good, the lavender fondue topping the list with the ravioli and poutine a close second, but the unfriendly atmosphere eclipsed it completely. I've checked it off and Im not going back. I came in about a week ago for dessert. We started the evening off with goat cheese and lavender fondue, which now I know I am not a big fan of. Then my friend ordered a burger, which came with a small mountain of fries (the fries were oh so good). I ended up ordering three deserts; coconut cream pie, irish stout cake with ice cream, and little moon pies with a side of chocolate and banana ice cream. The irish stout cake was far too dense for my liking and the stout that came with it not for me, the ice cream tasted like beer which worked well with the cake. The coconut cream pie, personally I don't get the hype. I mean it's alright but it's nothing special. The best thing was the little moon pies (there were 3 and filled with this marshmallow filling) that came with banana ice cream. I could eat that stuff forever. We loved PK. &#160;ProIlly more a 4.5 rating than a 4.Picture it: Saturday night, approximately 6:30, just me and my man. &#160;Diners were all abuzz and we were immediately taken to a table. &#160;We didn't really want to sit in the room with the large party of 12-14, so we opted to try our chances at the bar.The bartender wasn't really willing (able?) to concoct me a drink outside of their menu, so I opted for the Blood Orange Margarita. &#160;It was excellent! &#160;Seeing that the other peeps at the bar were settled in for dinner and not going to leave any time soon, we decided to put our name in for another table. &#160;We got seated about 10 minutes later in the back booth area.I was looking forward to 2 things: the fondue and the burger. &#160;Upon reviewing the menu I saw that they had so much more that I wanted to try, but kept true to my goal. (The late-night-only palaquiles looks DELISH).Our server was upbeat and pleasant. &#160;She brought us more drinks right away, and another server brought us the bread and oil/vinegar/olive mixture. &#160;Yum-o. &#160;I just love EXCELLENT bread and tasty oil (California Arbequena Olive Oil is high on my list).To start we had the fondue and my man had the romaine salad. &#160;That fondue was just a DREAM. &#160;Bread was perfectly toasted with a little bit of char. &#160;The cheese was so smooth and earthy, with just a HINT of the lavender. &#160;OMG, so good. &#160;The salad with its GINORMOUS crouton was refreshing with its parmesan dressing. &#160;Reminded me of a caesar salad, but no icky-anchovies in sight.Then THE burger arrived; my man got the Porchetta special, which was a super tender piece of pork over a bed of yummy grits, greens, and topped with some sort of relish. &#160;Really very, very excellent.Back to my burger. &#160;I opted for the sharp cheddar cheese and bacon toppings. &#160;The bacon was 3 pieces of super smokey goodness! &#160;Oh man. &#160;So good. &#160;The burger itself was uber juicy and meaty. &#160;On the side there was a mayo/ailoi dressing that was truly yummy. &#160;And the accompanying fries were top-notch. &#160;My favorite burger in Seattle is made by JaK's Grill, but the PK burger is a CLOSE second.To end the meal - our guts were bursting, but we had to try something - we opted for the Chocolate Potato Cake. &#160;It was a wedge of chocolate cake topped with chocolate ganache, a little peanut butter truffle and a small cup of malted vanilla shake. The cake was moist, but nothing mind-blowing. &#160;It really needed that ganache topping to give it some oomph. &#160;The truffle and milkshake, however, were truly great. &#160;I'm not a fan of peanut butter, but their truffle made me look twice.Overall we had a great experience at PK and will absolutely be back, ready to try some of the other deliciousness that was on the menu. &#160;I can't wait. Fresh local ingredients, superb professional staff, open kitchen and perfect execution. &#160;I have been here twice and the Palace Kitchen is one of the best examples of gourmet pacific northwest fare. &#160;Happy hour is a bit tough and most of the time very crowded.Reservations are a must and ask for a table near the kitchen to watch the show if you are a foodie. &#160;They have half bottles of beautiful wines so it is easy to have a white with your apps and a red with dinner (or vice versa).Order the oysters. What else is left to say about Palace Kitchen that hasn't been said. I fell in love with their Triple Coconut Cream Pie. I'm not going to say much about this place, but to go there. It's a good place to go to at night and after a jazz show in Jazz Alley!I went here as a surprise or a last minute detour with my ex, who took me there for my birthday. It's one of the best nights we had. A great place to go on a date. It's somewhat loud, but I like the atmosphere. I had a great time here tonight--part of it had to do with meeting with old friends again and part of it had to do with our food &amp; super awesome waitress. I didn't catch her name though, sadly, but my friends and I came for Seattle Restaurant Week and we all left full and super happy. I ordered the Spring Onion Soup, Steak with mashed potatoes &amp; Chinese greens and the White Chocolate &amp; Hazelnut Fondue with apples and banana financiers. The soup was creamy and delicious, the steak was cooked perfectly and the dessert was great, but I couldn't eat much of it (my friends' Earl Grey Creme Caramels looked so good). Our waitress noticed that I had so much of the fondue left and thought it was a waste so she suggested that we put some in coffee. It sounded like a great idea, so she brought over a cup of coffee (which I think was free) and she was right, it tasted really great in the coffee! &#160;Again, it was an awesome night with friends and I'm so thankful they didn't make us wait since we had a last-minute 2-person cancellation. Thank you Palace Kitchen! Late night drinking.... and dining... After our 6th meal of the day (while on vacation...) we decided to head to Palace Kitchen for drinks and dessert. The place was practically empty, so we sat at the bar and got served by a less than enthusiastic bartender that couldn't make any drink suggestions and surprised us with an awful drink! The drinks were pretty much like that all night.... the only highlight of the evening was the famous Tom Douglas Triple Coconut Cream Pie. It was heaven I tell you.... so delicately made and so utterly delicious!! Also, there was a cock (male rooster) in the window. So we all took one next to it and then proceeded to post the pictures on Facebook with the title... "Went to Seattle and saw a cock" :)Those are the only two reasons why I gave this place a 2 star. Otherwise.... it would have been a 1 star establishment. Keep in mind I didn't try any of the food. Dear Palace Kitchen, Thank you for making gourmet Faux Spam appetizers! Thank you again for the deeeelish blood orange margarita.! And a MILLION "THANK YOUS" &#160;that I am shouting at your face for having Sue be my bartender!!! Sue is the best and makes my Palace Kitchen Dining experience the bomb! &#160;Sincerely, Your Faithful Eater We met a Belltown local friend, who we'll call Belle, at The Palace Kitchen for dinner, satisfying Squirrel's desire to return, after having cocktails there earlier in the year. Even approaching the area of the restaurant, we could tell we were in for a treat, with the smell of smoking bacon on the air.The bartender helped Squirrel recreate the summer cocktail he had, even though it wasn't featured in the winter. We waited at the busy bar area to be seated, which occurred relatively quickly for a busy restaurant. Our table was by the huge front windows, giving us a great view of the street and the Needle.We started with the lavender goat cheese fondue. It was served with chunks of Dahlia-made bread, brushed with olive oil and grilled, and fresh Washington apple. With the bread, this little treat would snap your eyes back in your head, really allowing the flavors of the fondue to shine. It was good with the apple as well, though the fondue had to compete with the flavor of the apple. I followed the appetizer with the bibb lettuce salad with toasted hazelnuts and Beecher's flagship cheese. The salad was simple, flavorful, and wonderfully refreshing with its tangy vinaigrette dressing with fresh snipped herbs.We had the tuna, Beef bavette with preserved smoked tomato, and New York beef loin. The tuna was medallions seared, and presented with slightly pink centers, and topped with a red pepper tapenade. The beef dishes were served with rail beans and greens, in a jus. The bavette was sliced flank-steak style, and topped with the smoked tomato preserve. The loin was prepared medium rare, and topped with a red wine and herb laced butter. The entrees were all wonderful, though next time if I opt for beef, I'll go with the bavette over the loin, which was a little tough. I also really want to try the toasted spaetzle gratin entree.Dessert was a nice cap to the meal. Squirrel opted for the chocolate potato cake, and I had the coconut creme pie. Belle showed great will power, and finished with a cup of coffee. The exotic sounding chocolate potato cake was actually a dense chocolate cake prepared with mashed potatoes as a moistening agent. It was a fantastic cake, more chocolate than sugar, and was paired with a vanilla malted shot, and a peanut butter chocolate truffle. The coconut creme pie was classic, with a dense, custardy coconut filling topped with a light cloud of whipped cream, and smothered with toasted coconut.While the name of the restaurant evokes images of velvet and gold rococo, the dining room is actually more a wood joinery cachebox filled with a warm golden glow. The food is the indulgence here, and it's a great space to break bread with friends. I would say the noise level is not quite hushed enough for an intimate or romantic dinner; however, the private dining rooms may offer a better venue for those special occasions. We definitely have to go back later in the year to see what is new on the menu, as some of the dishes are seasonal offerings. This was quite a delicious start to my foray into Seattle Restaurant Week 2010. To my knowledge, almost all the Tom Douglas restaurants are participating. And do you know what happens when 3 friends order off the SRW menu? That's right, I got to taste 3 appetizers, 3 entrees AND 3 desserts all in one go. Now that's genius. Their menu online isn't the most updated, they let you choose ANY of the desserts on their menu as your 3rd course! Sweet! (literally)The standouts were the flat iron steak, the black &amp; tan Irish stout cake and the cherry blossom cocktail. Steak was seared perfectly and a gorgeous blushing red in the middle with soft mashed potatoes and asparagus. And the dessert came with a shot of the Irish stout, like woah. I downed it before digging into the fluffy chocolate cake with choco ganache drizzled on top and savoring the sharp black/tan ice-cream on the side. But before all that, I started off the night with a lovely cherry blossom cocktail that was just the right mix of sweet and alchy with a brandied cherry at the bottom of the glass. Very Sex and the City (ok, I've never seen that show but I imagine this is what they'd drink.) The rest of the dishes were pretty good but nothing too memorable. As a starter, I had the pork &amp; dungeness crab sausage and didn't taste the crab at all but smashed peas were tasty. Spring onion soup was a lot lighter than French onion and at least they used Beecher's cheese on the arugula salad. Really dim lighting, short but just attentive enough service and hello, one of the ladies bathroom stalls has a full-length mirror and curtains. Why? Who knows! Seriously check out some of the participating restaurants during these 2 weeks, I probably saved $15 getting 3 full-sized courses for $25. MmmmOn another random note, my dad used to own Nara Grill across the street over 7 years ago. It makes me a sad panda to see how run down it's become ... I don't really have anything to complain about:* We found street parking right outside the door.* We lucked into two seats at the bar while waiting for our table.* We had the kickass lavender goat cheese fondue with our cocktails.* We split the burger -- said to be one of the best (or THE best?) burgers in Seattle. It was plennnnnnnty tasty but the fries?!!? OH MY GOSH THE FRIES! * We split the cheese plate -- the boyfriend popped his cheese plate cherry right there in front of everyone! * We split the coconut cream pie -- given the amount of rich creaminess going on there (and considering I'd just plowed through fondue, french fries and cheese), even *I*, the QUEEN of all things coconut, couldn't get through half a piece.All in all, I can't think of a single reason to go four stars instead of five!Go Palace Kitchen, go! Indulgence! &#160;If there was a one word review option, this would be it. &#160;It's always a pleasure to find a restaurant which fulfills the definition of that word, and Tom Douglas puts his best plate forward, for this bistro style affair. What did we have? &#160;Appetizer: Palace Olive Poppers &amp; Seared Scallops. &#160;Entr&#233;e: Pan Roasted Black Cod (Hers) &amp; Palace Burger Royale (Mine)Dessert: Little Ice Cream Sandwiches &amp; Gateau Basque. The appetizer did exactly what it was supposed to; it wet our mouths with the expectation of good food. &#160;The Olive poppers were little bites of olive perfection, lightly battered olives, which are nicely stuffed; we promptly disregarded our manners, and just stabbed our forks into them. &#160;The seared scallops, which totaled three, wasn't amazing in terms of seafood, but it was tasty, and worth getting if you want some well prepped scallops; but I'm going to mix it up the next time I'm back here. &#160;The Entr&#233;e... I had the burger, which was cooked medium rare by default. &#160;It was a darn good burger, with lots of fries, options in cheese and bacon, and by the time you put everything on it, my best advice is to open wide, it's a tall burger. &#160;It's 8 ounces of fun for your taste buds, the beef they use also tasted different, and in a very good way, leaner and more flavorful; and there isn't any reason to not enjoy it. &#160;Hers was the Black Cod; I only had a small bite, but it tasted pretty darn good; she ate it quickly, and explained how much she enjoyed it, so I'm going to let that be its own explanation. &#160;I did notice that they gave her a large chuck of pork belly, which worked with the fish (to my surprise). Dessert! &#160;This time, I didn't fail, and this is where indulgence takes center stage. &#160;Little Ice Cream Sandwiches were chocolate chip cookies with a nice scoop of creamy ice creamy goodness. &#160;I think that it complemented our second dessert, the Gateau Basque, which had nicely spiced apple flavors, caramel and ginger flavors, which worked great with the ice cream. &#160;These two worked out great!All in all, it was a great dinner, and in terms of great restaurants, I like places where I can just simply go, have a great meal, and not have it get in the way of great conversations. &#160;Go here, take a girl or guy, take a group, take kids, take adults, take adults who are kids, &#160;just go, it's worth it! My most favorite tom douglas restaurant. The smoky smell just makes me happy. I came here to dine with one of my gf's and we decided to share a bunch of app's and some chicken from the smoker. I had to. it was not too bad, but the one item that stuck out in my mind were these croquettes! damn they were good, and the service was phenomenal. The one recommendation is, could their dining hours be a little bit later?!!!!! I always want to come here at night, but they are always closed :( After hearing such great reviews on their burgers, I had to try it for myself. I gotta say it was the saltiest burger I've ever had. The ambiance was great but was highly disappointed in their burger. I wanted to like this place so very badly, but boy was I underwhelmed, disappointed and now I have indigestion. I have no idea what the buzz is about. I went with the hubby and two friends and between all of us got 4 appetizers, 4 entrees and all the of the dessert options. Nothing was outstanding with the exception of the Coconut Cream Pie. Most of the dishes were just strange tasting (lingering after taste, odd texture, ingredients that definitely didn't seem like they belonged together, etc.). Also, the wine list was shockingly boring. Truthfully, I think I would, no I know I would have preferred a taco from the taco truck. This is my first Tom Douglas experience and I am just so sad. The sunny side is we had a very nice, attentive server. However, the food (especially for the price) just isn't worth it. I love their shirley temple, made with house-made grenadine! Sooo good. Also sooo good: plin. &#160;Little tiny pork filled ravioli type things in a buttery sauce. Incredibly tasty and satisfying. &#160;All the Tom Douglas restaurants have amazing food, but thanks to the friendly servers here, Palace Kitchen is my favorite! My husband and I love this place. The food is always excellent and we ate there last night. The wait staff is always really available and the menu changes often enough that I can count on finding something new to try every time we go. My favorite place. Literally, I walk from home to eat there food and drinks fine drinks. They have always given me the best service and a joke or two. I just made myself hungry writing this review. Go, be treated well. They also don' have a high turnover of staff, which says a lot. I don't get it. &#160;Everything was just ok. &#160;And for the price, you can find much, much better ambience. &#160;Although the place was packed, it was too noisy, no music, just bustling waitstaff and people talking over each other. &#160;Not the kind of place that makes you want to linger over a nice dinner. &#160;Food was unimpressive. &#160;Ravioli was cold. &#160;The highlight was certainly the coconut cream pie. &#160;But all the other reviewers could tell you that. Terrific atmosphere, fantastic wine list, excellent food. Our meal started off with a bottle of wine followed by bread served with high end olive oil and vinegar. My enormous garlic crouton and romaine lettuce salad was terrific and set the mood for the trout that I ordered afterwards.The waitress was great too. She recommended the wine and filleted the fish for me table-side (I've never been good at that). &#160;Will definitely return again. I have always seen "Idaho Trout" on menus and rolled past it like it wasn't even there. One, Idaho doesn't excite me......two, I've caught many trout and it's not that hard. To a simple palate, it wasn't anything that ever stuck out.......until I had it here. Order it, you won't be disappointed, not to mention having the lovely lady fillet it at the table........The flavors were perfect! You'd think maybe a glass of white? Nope, cool night........thought I'd go with elderflower and gin (makeshift lychee martini, great recommendation) I'm going back!!!!!! I had forgotten how great this place is until I went a few nights ago after seeing a movie at the Cinerama. The layout is fabulous. The huge bar in the center with the open kitchen behind.... perfect. The service is always exceptional and the food is amazing. The next out of town guest I have, I will defintely take them here. This place was fantastic! &#160;Not to mention the great service. &#160;The fondue was yummy and enough to feed 4 people. &#160;We arrived without a reservation on Valentine's Day, went to the bar and had a drink, and 25 minutes later we were seated. &#160;Everyone in my party that got food was very impressed. &#160;All food had been cooked over a food grill and it was tasty. &#160;This is the second time I have been here and I enjoyed it just as much. &#160;Had a romantic and dim lighting ambiance. Loved it! Thank you Palace Kitchen. High recomend - some of the best food I've had to seattle - I will continue to go back and work my way through their menu! Great place for a bite particularly late night. &#160;The plim and coconut cream pie were two big highlights We went here after a long flight from Philadelphia. &#160;The place was quick and the food was great. &#160;Tasted fresh and local. &#160;The ravioli was tremendous. Went here for the seattle restaurant week. &#160;Had a really good meal. &#160;All the food was thoughtfully prepared and tasted great. &#160;I will definitely eat here again. Palace Kitchen has the best nice vegetarian food I've had in Seattle. Generally, nicer restaurants always feature a pasta as their vegetarian entree option, and as much as I do like truffled or creamy or stuffed pasta's, it gets repetitive quickly. Palace Kitchen has TWO vegetarian entree options, one of which is an awesome not-pasta dish. I had: - Arugula Salad: So very very good. The arugula &amp; other herbs are refreshing, and the serving size is decent (not meal sized, but bigger than most app salads). All the components complement each other really well, with the nutty-ness of the toasted hazelnuts balancing out the spiciness of the arugula and the cheese mellowing out the grainy mustard dressing. I very happily could order 2 of these &amp; make a meal of it. - Goat Cheese Dumplings: Absolutely amazing. One of the most delicious "fancy" dishes I've had seen becoming a vegetarian and I will definitely come back to Palace Kitchen specifically to eat it. The dumplings are almost like a thick savory cake, with a large dollop of creamy mild goat cheese in the middle. They are buttered and grilled on the outside &amp; soft and moist on the inside, with an incredible consistency that perfectly absorbs the delicious broth ladled on the bottom of the dish. The broth itself is amazing, full of multiple indistinguishable flavors that work perfectly together. The plate is served with 2 dumplings, on top of a small mound of sauteed vegetables. A really unique delicious dish. -Dessert: Nothing to write home about. The triple cream coconut pie is light &amp; tasty, but not particularly mind blowing. The rhubarb pie was yummy, but again, nothing unique. I definitely will skip dessert next time and order another appetizer. - The free olive oil &amp; balsamic vinegar served with bread at the beginning of the meal is fantastic. Their olive oil is high quality &amp; fruity fresh. I had an exceptional dinner! Totally recommend the rotisserie chicken for a main course! Love this place... fun cocktails, great food, great happy hour. Oh Palace, you have never let me down. Regardless of how my days going or the mood I'm in, when I walk in your door all that melts away and all I can think of is one fabulous word... food.My BF and I revisited Palace for the umpteenth time this last weekend (it has become a haunt since I work nearby) and were not disapointed.The service was not quite as top notch as usual, server seemed a touch out of it but certainly had no problem getting our orders right so no major complaints. It was, as usual loud, so i had to lean close to my man to hear his comments bout the next table overs meal. We had the abalone mushroom and leek bread pudding which was tasty but i couldn't find the advertised hedgehog mushrooms though I could taste them, the seared rare albacore tuna which was served with beets which I ADORED (and I hate beets!), and the wood grilled beef tongue which was reallly good but sadly the wood grilling totally removed the unique flavor that is tongue and simply left it with a sort of short rib flavor... still dam good. The presentations were simple overall and clean and oh that bread they brought to my table made me smile : )I really do like this place as being a go to restaurant when your hungry for comfort food, nice comfort food that is, without being over the top expensive or ostentacious in any way. You know, I really was not that impressed by the food at this place. &#160;The decor, ambiance, and appeal of the Palace Kitchen is indisputable. &#160;But the food? &#160;Meh. &#160;One of us had the burger (mediocre, especially given the price), and the other an entree that we're having a hard time even recalling. &#160;Just... almost... blah. &#160;Not inedible by any means, but one should expect better. &#160;I've had a lot better in the bay area. &#160;I seem to remember that the food at the *old* Cyclops Cafe was markedly better and a whole lot cheaper. Went on a Saturday night around 10pm. Very dim and packed place. Great service. I told them I had 20 minutes to eat and they definitely served me well. Saw wood grilled beef tongue on their appetizer menu and had to try it because I had never seen or eaten that before. It was delicious. For dessert, I ordered the dahlia triple coconut cream pie and OMG I wanted the entire cake. Delicious! The chicken wings were the best I have ever had, the duck confit was great, and my husband loved the tartare, but the caesar was overdressed and bland, and the huge crouton was greasy. Overall, a fun place with an upbeat atmosphere, good service, and fun food!
I may be biased because I live nearby, and every so often, when I show up right around closing time, they always seem to still fit in my order without any attitude... even though I might deserve it for being so late.I've tried almost everything on the menu, and outside of the fajitas, which just didn't "sizzle" (I mean that literally and figuratively) I REALLY enjoy them all! &#160;Favorites: Pancho Villa Burrito, Ceviche, Enchilada Crema...And did I mention tequila? &#160;They've got what you need. &#160;And will happily take the time to describe each one to you. &#160;Some nights it's &#160;like a wine tasting up there, except way more drunker. &#160;Ole! This place is really good. &#160;I don't think portions are small - they are more than enough. &#160;I got the pollo creama last time and it was enough for dinner then and a big portion for lunch the next day. &#160;I've also had the enchaladas and those are good too.Staff is very nice - the place is friendly, lively &amp; seriously yummy. If you haven't been to Mr. Villa in a while, now is the time to stop by! I stopped in this week for dinner and noticed they've added new mole dishes to the menu. The mole negro is complex and smokey, but the mole blanco, with almonds and white chocolate is a rare flavor experience, at once both savory and sweet, entree and dessert. Thumbs up as always for the homemade tortillas, fresh juice margaritas, and delicious salsas. I avoid the live music nights (Monday &amp; Wednesday), but I'll be back soon for more delicious mole! A great place to eat and they have really great food. I had fajitas and a jarrito (mexican soda). The food was really good, the fajitas were homemade and it was very nice. It was cozy with candle's on all the tables and the atmosphere was great. The people working there were nice and welcoming. This little restaurant on Lake City Way (northeast Seattle) is one of those neighborhood joints you just love to eat at. The food is the antithesis of Azteca, where everything is so Americanized that you don't get a hint of ethnic. The people are friendly, the place (understandably) crowded and all three times we've been here we have loved the food. If you're looking for Mexican, this is a great place to go. Just beware it can get very crowded. Carninats + horchata = awesome! &#160;The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is for that the place is overrun by loud children. In my opinion, good Mexican is hard to come by in Seattle, it's out there, but it'snt vareity the spice of life. My BF and I tried this place on a whim and were pleasantly surprised! The food we've ordered has always been good - nothing that blew our socks of, but being consistently good means something. Oh, and they have corn syrup free coca-cola ... you know, the Mexican kind, that's made with real sugar :) If your in the mood for Mexican and in the neighborhood, give it a try! P.S. To those of you who complained of cheese that was servied to you and had not melted yet; Cotija is not supposed to melt! I wouldn't trust a reviewer who is unfamiliar with the cuisine they are eating... but that's just me. Returned for dinner last weekend. The place was packed however the owner did a masterful job of somehow seating people with little to no wait. At the same time we were never rushed and had great service. Marvelous Mole Sauce, spicy good guac. and tasty tacos. Mr. Villa is maybe our favorite Mexican place in Seattle? I've always driven by this place on Lake City Way, but never ventured inside. Husband and I were feeling a bit adventurous last week so we decided to check it out. The inside is small, but cozy -- I think there were about 10-12 tables and by the time we were finished eating (around 730p), every single table was full. We were both really pleasantly surprised by how good this place was. The tortilla chips were warm, fresh and slightly oily -- yum! We devoured 2 baskets. The accompanying salsas were delicious as well -- a mild verde and slightly spicier tomato. My chicken fajitas did not disappoint. Lots of crunchy peppers and onions with big chunks of well-seasoned chicken. It was served with fresh lettuce and generous portions of sour cream and guacamole. Their portions are huge -- I felt stuffed after eating finishing half of it. Oh, and they also had live music while we were eating, which was pretty cool and gave the restaurant a nice atmosphere. Good queso fundido, but could have had more fire. &#160;Very much liked the silky horchata. Also liked the hefty helping of carnita in my taco. &#160;Mr. Villa's uses a just-like-mom's recipe for the ceviche tostada, which is a good thing. Ive always driven by this place and decided to stop in. Actually, this is another one of those " we wanted to go there,but the line was too long" story. So we wanted to go to X,but the line was too long. So I decided this was the day we would venture over to Mr. Villas. The inside is very cute and intimate and when I say intimate, I mean you may get to get cozy with the next table beside you. It was pretty loud when we arrived,so that was perfect. If my child starts to scream and throw a tantrum,no one would be the wiser. The tortilla chips were good,salsa good and I ordered a virgin Sangria. I also ordered the enchilada ( puzzled). This was the smallest enchilada Ive ever eaten at a Mexican restaurant. It was almost as if it decided one day to stop taking steroids. I like my Mexican food grande! This was not. The beans and rice were good and I left not feeling like I ate an entire city. It was a step up from Azteca,but not as good as Rositas or that place that used to be in Factoria. I thought the food was good though and my dh liked his meal and for some reason my son wanted chicken fingers that night ( which they had!) I really wanted to like this place, but it was a miss. I don't like to complain about my food and usually just eat it even if I don't like it. I think I've been spoiled by some great mexican food in the past.I had the nachos. Pretty simple plate. I was starving, but didn't want a huge dish like most mexican restaurants tend to do. She had the carne asada tacos which she loved. My nachos were cold. They looked like they were sitting on the expediting table until her tacos were done. It's kind of when you order nachos to-go and you get home and they are soggy, well that's what I got. I wanted some crispy nachos.The manager was polite. I will come back and give them another try because they tried and were very apologetic. I went here this weekend and ordered enchiladas. As soon as we sat down, the waiter came with warm chips and two types of salsa (the verde salsa was the spicier of the two) and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. The enchiladas were delicious. They were a bit small for a restaurant. Each one was about 5 1/2" long and 1" thick. But, they were tasty. I got one chicken and one shredded beef. The tortillas were stuffed with meat and the outside was covered in red sauce. Plus, they came with sour cream, which I love. But, they were not covered in cheese, which I also liked. So, if you like lots of cheese in your enchiladas, this isn't the place for you. To make up for the small enchilada size, the rice and beans were very large portions (more than I could finish). The rice was not greasy at all and very flavorful. And the beans were not your typical re-fried beans. I was served whole pinto beans that were also very good. My boyfriend ordered the carne asada and it was not the best he or I had ever had. It did not taste barbecued or fire grilled. It came with flour tortillas, which did not seem very different from the kind you buy at the store (said to be homemade). But, he did receive quite a bit of meat and his meal came with sour cream and guacamole. Throughout the meal, our water kept being refilled. The servers were all very friendly. I will definitely be returning here, but I won't order the carne asada. I've been going to Mr. Villa for years and it's so good! The food is excellent no matter what you order and they bring it out so quickly! Their signature Mr. Villa Burrito is the best and I try to save 1/2 for lunch the next day....but it tastes so good that sometimes that is a challenge! So yummy!! I love, love, love Mr. Villa. &#160;Each dish that I've had there has been better than the last. &#160;I have had &#160;their Enchiladas, Pollo Asado, Fajitas and tacos. &#160;All have been delicious. &#160;I also really enjoyed their warm chips with two different kinds of salsa. &#160;I really love that they have mexican cokes in the bottle there as well. &#160;What sets this place apart is the service. &#160;We have always been treated really well. &#160;Any questions we have had been answered in a warm, friendly manner. &#160;The space is intimate, but I never mind it. &#160;It just makes it feel more like you're dining with family. If you are looking for a place that gives you optimum privacy and quiet, do not go here.However, if you are looking for some of the best hand made tortillas, fun house band, and original Mexican dishes DO come here!Mr. Villa is a small location, but the flavor packed in their dishes is big. Service is great, super attentive severs, and did I mention the flavors are AWESOME here?! I got the cheese enchiladas and wow..totally shocked me! They were topped with not just regular shredded cheese, but a yummy, soft white cheese that made them seemingly melt in my mouth. Prices are a little on the high side (for Mexican) but if your looking to support a delicious local joint, take a visit to Mr. Villas. Mondays include free, live music! When someone gives you 2 different tequila shots to try and educates you on different types of tequila, how can you now give it 5 stars.I was craving a margarita all day, and passing this place I decided to stop in. &#160;The people were all so friendly. &#160;It was sort of like you didn't know who your server was. &#160;I had three people come to my table refilling my chips, asking me if I needed anything, etc. &#160;I will definitely go back again. I've found a new winner for closest approximation to Mexican food in Seattle: Mr. Villa.I've only gotten burritos to go so far: A Pancho Villa burrito, no meat and no raw onions runs you about twice what a roach coach would but it is GIGANTIC and tasty and almost reminds me of California. I'm looking forward to sitting down some time and trying out their enchiladas and picking from their vast list of tequila. The service is very friendly, but the space is small. Totally adequate food. Reminds me of the Jalisco on Lake City. Slightly better than Azteca. Not as good as the El Camion taco truck in terms of quality and flavor-fullness. Very loud. Staff was friendly. Not super big--pays to call ahead for a large party. Busy on Fri night. Good authentic Mexican food, friendly service and decent prices. Nice selection of top-shelf tequila for margaritas! Good mole dishes. The shrimp tacos are the best! I have been going to this place for years, and it is great for the whole family. Although not fancy, Mr. Villa has style-- from the funkily painted walls and art to the soundtrack of music hand-picked by the owner. Live music nights are fun to come to with friends.My favorite dishes are the chicken fajitas, the prawn tacos, the avocado tostada and of course, the yummy guacamole. The tacos come with a special handmade taco sauce that I really like.It can get pretty crowded on weekend nights, so plan to arrive early. Mexican food done right....It's not everyday you get a great Mexican joint in Seattle, let alone your neighborhood. Luckily, I live down the street from this place and it's not to be missed.The plates are hot, cheesy, hearty, fresh and flavorful. Give the enchiladas a try. They're awesome. The rice and beans are not your usual bland fair and actually have great taste that compliment the entree.Service is very attentive and quick. They don't let the beverages go unfilled, as well as the fresh chips and salsa made in house.If you can spare the room (god knows you'll be able to), give their dessert menu a try. Mr. Villa brings a slightly more authentic take on Gringo-Mexican than Azteca or Jalisco. The chili verde is awesome, and Im not a huge chili verde fan, either. Pork is really hit or miss with me, and I've never had it be "miss" here. I've always come and never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a table, but i would recommend calling ahead with a group of more than two or three, because it can, and will, get busy. &#160;This is a neighborhood joint, expect screaming children. This is also one of the few places where I've had people ask to see my ID fo my "See ID" debit card. We dined at Mr. Villa yesterday and it was decent Mexican food. &#160;I am not a fan of places like Azteca or non-authentic Mexican food. &#160;I like the little restaurants that are run by family....and I think I'll add this one to our list of "go back to" restaurants. &#160;I ordered the chicken burrito and it was delicious. &#160;It was a good sized portion with rice and refried beans. &#160;It also came with a small spoonful of iceberg lettuce and tomatoes. &#160;It would've been nice to have a little more of that and some sour cream added on top! Typical Tex Mex fare, but excellent chips and salsa. I totally dug there spicy house salsa!Huge burritos that are probably bigger than Chipotle's and run around $9 no sides. The wife had a monster combination plate of the entire menu double covered and smothered.Honestly Im not a big fan of tex-mex food, but this place does a good job and an even better job on their house salsa! I really wanted to like Mr. Villa--so much so that after a first mediocre meal, I went back a second time to see if my first impression was incorrect. Alas, no. For me, Mr. Villa seems to have perfected the art of mediocre Mexican. A family of four, we had a burrito, fajitas, nachos and enchiladas. The enchiladas were dry to the point that my wife just sort of picked through half the plate. The burrito and nachos were fine, but not extraordinary. I did not care for whatever spices my chicken fajitas were cooked in.My wife had the house margarita, I had a branded margarita. The difference was notable. I don't know what sort of tequila they are using in their house drinks, but it was clearly bottom of the barrel.Service was decent--worthy of a full 20% tip. All in all, the meal came to $86--what I would consider to be on the expensive side for a simple family night out at a simple neighborhood restaurant.I dunno. I guess I'd just say that in a city full of choices, having disappointed me twice, I'll be checking out other restaurants in the future. Got a tasty burrito and some salty chips. The guacamole was good and plentiful within my burrito. The burritos are big -- not baby sized like Gordito's, but at least the size of a large guinea pig.Why not more stars? It's way more expensive than a good taco truck. My burrito was $10. Also, there was some confusion there over what was vegetarian and what was not. They told me all of there beans were vegetarian, then asked if I was vegan. I said no, assuming they were checking to see if the cheese and sour cream were okay by me. Instead, they were making sure I knew that there was chicken/pork stock in the sauces and rice. Don't they know that most vegetarians don't eat animal-based stocks either? As a result, I'm a bit unclear on whether the beans I ate were ACTUALLY vegetarian, or if they just thought they were okay as there we no meat hunks in them.The people here were really nice, despite this confusion, and we enjoyed our task out order. Large quantities, fresh tasting veggies, and tasty cheese. If the prices were lower and the definition of vegetarianism clearer, I'd give them four stars. Since the move from Arizona to Seattle, Washington (and even before while visiting), I have been in a constant search for Mexican food that is up to my palate as a Southwesterner. &#160;Initially I had trouble-didn't see much around and the few places I ventured to try weren't up to snuff-- but luckily just up the street from our condo is Mr. Villa which I think is going to be able to satisfy my at least monthly (if not biweekly) cravings.Mr. Villa is small, clean, and flavorful. &#160;Its a great neighborhood place with moderate prices on the lower end of things, great friendly service, and food that I would deem authetic to its ilk.On some nights (not exactly sure which and haven't been watching enough to notice a pattern), there is a live band that holes up in the small dining room and entertains the diners and staff.We had a bean and cheese chimichanga (which wasn't on the menu, but they were able to make it--yay! &#160;I always distrust the places who can't sub beans for meat in such situations) with rice and beans and a plate of nachos. &#160;There were about four (at least) different kinds of salsas brought to the table--each having a unique taste of varying levels of spice and heat. &#160;There is a full bar--which we didn't take advantage of (though I'll have to go back and order a margarita soon).The food was good, the cheese was quality, and everything came out piping hot. Went for dinner on a Thursday and the place was packed. &#160;Quite loud, wall to wall tables in a pretty generic space. &#160;Lots of kids in the place but no written kid menu or drawing supplies for them.I had the carne asada, which was pretty good, although slightly tough. The rice was almost cold and lacked favor, beans were pretty good; all in all, nothing special. &#160;Had to ask twice to get a glass of &#160;water and had to ask for a water refill (always a critical test of decent service for me). &#160;The house margarita was quite good &#160;at least. &#160;So, not a bad dining experience but nothing special; &#160;I really doubt we will go back though I am a snob about Mexican food because I am from the San Francisco Bay Area. Maybe not a snob, but I like it done right and I know what crap is. I've been to Mexico; I speak Spanish fluently; I have a fine set of taste buds and an excellent sense of smell. I think those are all my qualifications to judge this place. It's good. It's like a breath of fresh air. Fresh air laden with chiles and cilantro. Quite pricey for Mexican fare, though.The salsas are good and the chips are festive! Their refried beans are smoky and carmelly and beany, of course. The rice is good. The tortillas are chewy and have a nice quick-sear flavor (the chips have this too). I think I am used to dry tortillas, so these seemed so moist as to be disturbing. I will have to eat them several times a week to accustom my palate. The chicken and pork were super dry, but swimming in delicious sauce in whatever form you order them, so I don't know that that's a big detractor. It IS real meat from actual trimmed cuts - so nice not to be pulling chunks of nasty fat and gristle out of your teeth. I need to try more meats, for sure.But the mole. The mole made me cry - so chocolaty and sweetly spicy and smokey. Wow.
This restaurant is not a very clean place to eat at. First the table tops are very sticky as is no one has put it through a good cleaning for God know's how long and there was a smell of crap coming from somewhere behind where I was sitting. I didn't bother taking a look, but another booth was behind us so I'm not sure if it came from them or from somewhere else in the restaurant lol.The pho was not very tasty due to flavorless broth which makes a big difference when you're eating pho. Also my gf had indicated there was of a lot of msg in the broth. Bad, bad, bad!!!The service was adequate and quick with our food being served, but otherwise this was not a very good place to go for pho. I like the pho, friendly service but the restaurant itself needs some scrubbing (worn chairs, dirty mirrors etc). I like the complimentary cream puff.PS. I thought they also serve rice dishes but not. That was not really a big deal for me &#160;because I was only craving soup at that time. Than Bros. in West Seattle is a really basic, workaday pho house. &#160;I found the dining space to be clean and spacious, and the staff was very prompt and efficient. &#160;The short amount of time between when I placed and received my order was nothing short of astonishing!The pho itself was just fine. &#160;Not the very best bowl I've ever had (I still give the nod to Pho Aroma down on Delridge), but by no means the worst either. &#160;It's tasty, and unless you're that "Man vs. Food" glutton, you'll find the medium will suit most appetites just fine. &#160;At $5.75, it's an excellent value. &#160;The cream puff they include with each order is a nice touch as well.My only criticism on the place is the relatively limited menu at lunch. &#160;You can have anything you want, as long as it's pho. &#160;On the other hand, this may be a big reason why they can be so quick. &#160;Great place if you need lunch in a hurry.Solid, no-frills food and service, and good value for money. Really, for the price -- what are people expecting? &#160;It's a great value, with fast and efficient service. &#160;The pastries are a great added perk -- and they serve it so early, it makes it tough to resist having dessert before the meal. &#160;:) &#160;We enjoy the location in Federal Way, as well.Overall, you get a wonderful, hot bowl of noodles for a very reasonable price. &#160;The broth and veggies always make it a good, filling meal, without leaving us feeling stuffed, groggy, or gross afterwards. &#160;We'll be back! OMG! &#160;Look at the "white" ( and I say that loosely ) table clothes. This place is so dirty that it's a good thing the broth is hot. Look before you eat! I came here once before and it was ok. So i decided to come back for dinner with some friends a month ago. Holy crap was it terrible, the food was ok, a little watered down, but edible. but wow, there employees were terrible. How do you stand there 10 feet away and watch us eat. Every time We turned to look over he would quickly look into another direction. And when my friend gets up to use the restroom, another employee seems to have no sense of direction. He bump into my friend at least three times. This will be the last time I go back to that place. If your looking for decor and ambiance. Avoid this place. If your looking for good, inexpensive Pho in West Seattle, I recommend this place. The service is fast and the tables are uneven and the seating in the booths are bad. I ordered a take out for lunch since they are right across from street where I work....PHO-GA after consistently avoiding it for last one year because i heard bad things about the food...I paid $15 for two pho-ga to go...the broth was terribly salty...couldn't take one sip had to throw away everything...$15.00 down the drain...I learnt a big lesson....Listen PHO THAN brothers -Soysauce and salt doesn't make the broth....geez ...never again will I ever buy their product... Avoid the pho at all cost. I don't think it's even legal to have that much MSG in the broth. It's bad when you can see it. Took 2 bites, called it quits, ate my cream puff, and left. easily the best pho in West Seattle, and one of the best in the city. &#160;it's been able to maintain humble atmosphere even in a very upscale neighborhood. &#160;I love this place. &#160;SO FRESH! best pho in west seattle. massive amounts of good shredded chicken, noodles etc etc. i did take out and the broth was still warm when i got home. the noodles looked like they'd be all stuck together but as soon as i got them in the bowl they broke up. it was delish. fast, cheap, tasty. i didn't care about the ambiance, it's exactly what i thought it would and should be for the price. decent, standard pho. like every other pho restaurant, same decor, griminess, barebones service. just cuz ur in a hip white hood, dont expect more. in fact, u should thank ur lucky stars u dont have to drive 40 min to get this kind of authenticity like we do in LA! if u lived in a hood like this in LA, u'd have to drive across town to get something like this. we walked 10 min! wut wut! We love Than Bros, the one note I would have is it's too quiet in there. &#160;Aside from the sound of the crowd of people and the rumble of the fish tank it's way quiet. &#160;They need some music. &#160;Anything would be better than nothing but, just a low volume of background noise would be perfect and make the dining experience so much better. This is a basic, no frills type of pho restaurant but honestly, the simple slightly grimy ones are usually the best for delicious pho. I love getting pho for take-out to bring back to work and really like that they package the peppers, bean sprouts, and other items separately in a nice plastic container which makes transport easier. Great especially on a rainy Friday.
The interior of the Frontier Room is kinda ugly and dark. I found the help to be perfectly friendly. I ordered the brisket with a side of mac and cheese and a side of greens. Others at our table had the platter with beef, chicken and pork as well as corn muffins. Everyone was happy with their meals. I mean, it's not the most amazing dinner ever, but the servings were huge and we were satisfied. I wish the squirt-bottle of bbq sauce had a little more spice to it, or that they had hot sauce options, because all they had was Tabasco sauce. Oh well, still a decent bbq meal. Plus, it's fun to hang out in Belltown once in a while. Not a 3-star'er but not quite a 4 so we're going to go with a 3.5 on this one. I hadn't gone this to place before other than the occasional sweaty dance night on a Fri/Sat. But now that my post-college clubbing days are over, a friend told me I should go in during the day and actually eat the bbq there. I must say, it's always weird to go into a place that you've been to a hundred times but only during dimlit hours under the influence of several cocktails and not recognize it when you go in the light...but it was worth it. The bbq is slow-cooked and has great flavor, but it also tends to leave the meat dry - especially the chicken. I've had it both ways (succulent and moist as well as so dry it was like chalk) so I'll give it points for that bbq flavor but not for consistency in tenderness. The reason I like Frontier Room the most, however, is I love their mac and cheese. The sauce is perfectly right - unfortunately, however, they've changed their noodles and that may seem like a silly thing for me to gripe about, but before they were curly something-rathers that were perfect size and shape for holding that wonderfully cheesy sauce inside. So now since they've switched to other shaped noodles that just kind of swim in it and not harmoniously play with the sauce, it's kind of changed the mac and cheese for me. I'll still put it on my "favorites" list, but it just used to be better.A good experience for BBQ and I still recommend it to my friends! I tried the best dish they serve, a combination of pork, chicken and ribs.Portions were very generous, probably because I order only for myself an entree recommended for 2 people, but overall this is a place more quantity oriented than quality oriented.Everything was very very dry. The quality of the meat served was low but that's OK. In the end I paid for 2 pounds of meat as much as I pay for a 8oz fillet Mignon.Now that's the point, if you like big portions and you don't really care about the taste, that's the right place. If you have a palate more sophisticate, just avoid this restaurant... it's all about expectations!!!As far as the decor, I didn't like it, some &#160;of the seats at the booths are broken ( I had to change seat because I was falling down) and everything looks very cheap around. Rating for me was between 2 1/2-3 stars... this is why...Upon entering one Saturday night, I was thrilled by the red lighting glowing from the pendant lighting. &#160;Very old feeling, telling me this place has been around for a while jazzed up with interesting decor lighting. &#160;"I like this vibe I get from the environment".Our waitress this night was very helpful, peppy and fun!Food: okay, but not something that will have me rushing back for more. My friend and I shared the mac &amp; cheese, which was average... nothing special, but nothing wrong with it either. &#160;I tried the chicked bbq sandwich since it seemed to adverstise its a bbq place. &#160;Our waitress was very helpful in letting me substitute my side, I chose the cornbread... why not carb the night!BBQ sandwich was average. &#160;Not too dry and not too drenched in sauce. Again nothing excellent or bad about the dish. &#160;The cornbread was cornbread.To end the night, hot apple crisp with french ice cream... I was too carbed out to really enjoy this treat, but wasn't disappointed.Food averageAtomosphere more exciting than the foodCustomer service above average Solid BBQ. &#160;But I've never had the "legit" stuff (aka outside of WA), so what do I know... A friend and I split "The Ranchland" and an order of fried oysters. &#160;15 minutes later, as you might expect with any other BBQ place, my friend and I are greeted with a rather large platter of assorted meats; chicken, ribs, pork, and brisket. &#160;Aww yea.It's good BBQ, nothing more, and nothing less. &#160;It won't stick in your mind and haunt your dreams, but you won't walk out the door feeling unsatisfied, either. I've been here twice to party on weekends and I just don't get it. The layout is narrow &#160;and I don't like the gloominess of the place.My friend was upset we missed the costume contest and told the dj she was a loofah and he told her to take a shower. Um rude. "Sorry you missed it" would have sufficed.Since I don't eat meat, I doubt the restaurant aspect would appeal to me. There isn't a lot wrong with this place but there aren't enough things going for me to get excited about coming. Overall, I just don't really have that great of a time here. Took a buddy to a late lunch and had the St Louis Ribs with out the sauce.They are not the best ribs I have ever had, but they were good.I would go back. I love coming here to get my dance on at the end of the night in good ole Belltown. The only reason why I give this place 3 stars is because:1) It needs a bigger dance floor 2) it is so STUFFY! Get some A/C pumping in that place! I think guys have to pay cover...but I don't really know because I am a girl :P neener neener I came here for the food on a Tuesday night. Not the absolute best BBQ, but the food is simplistic. &#160;They don't drown the meat in BBQ sauce, so you get a lot if flavor from the cooking process, which I love. &#160;The baby back ribs were excellent. &#160;I enjoyed them more than the St. Louis ribs or the Pulled Pork. The jalape&#241;o corn bread was a treat. Portion size was small, but they were the perfect balance with a little kick. As for the service, I'm certain that our waiter was stoned. &#160;For most this would be a bad thing, but it made the meal more interesting. Overall, if you have a few days in Seattle or really like BBQ, check it out. I actually asked my best friend for some suggestions on restaurants. &#160;Out of a list of four different kinds of cuisines, this one definitely caught my boyfriend's eye. &#160;We ended up making reservations for a Friday night dinner to celebrate an early Mother's Day dinner for my boyfriend's mom, since he works on weekends. &#160;We made reservations for 7:30 and managed to get there at 7. &#160;We were able to get seated early, which I was surprised that it wasn't busy. &#160;We managed to get the booth near the front with the cowhide.My friend had also suggested that their fries were good and that they give you a good amount for really cheap. &#160;So we ended up ordering a small order of fries and a large order of the hush puppies as our "appetizer". &#160;The fries were fresh cut, which reminded us of Dick's fries, but not nearly as greasy or soggy. &#160;Their large order of hush puppies consisted of 8, the size of meatballs served with a dipping sauce. &#160;Both very good!As for our entrees, my boyfriend's parents decided to go for the platter for two that was a variety of everything, which included baby back ribs, BBQ chicken, beef brisket, and pulled pork with sides of cole slaw and potato salad. &#160;My boyfriend and I decided to share a full rack of St. Louis ribs which came with a side of cole slaw as well. &#160;Everything was so tender and luckily they keep their BBQ sauce in a bottle on the table, if you want to add more. &#160;I don't like my ribs being over sauced, so this was great! &#160;Although I managed to only savor 3-4 ribs, we all had to share a dessert off their menu. &#160;There was so much to choose from. &#160;We went for their seasonal fruit cobbler. &#160;Their season fruit happened to be peach. &#160;It looked like they baked it right in the ramekin dish topped off with vanilla ice cream! &#160;It was great that it was served nice and warm!Overall, we were all pleased to have tried out a new restaurant all together and to all be satisfied with our meals. Was here with a group of friends. Very crowded last Saturday night. Some people were rude and just pushing through the crowd. Guys are $5 cover and girls get in for free.There was a bar where lots of people just enjoyed chatting with friends. I thought that was nice. Also lots of people were dancing on the dance floor.I would not necessarily come back again unless friends suggest so. I used to live down the street and so frequented The Frontier Room from time to time... &#160;Mind you, for dancing on Fri/Sat is the only time I've ever been here!My intoxication levels are seriously correlated with the fun I have here. &#160;If you are looking to meet folks in their mid/late twenty's and thirties, this is your spot! &#160;It's a really fun, outgoing crowd. &#160;The dancefloor is super fun--they play a wide range of top 40/pop to some oldies. &#160;Something for everyone, right?What Frontier room is not: a place to catch up with friends on a Saturday or Sunday night; lots of sober people.What it is: a really fun place to meet Belltown twenty something professionals; a place to get your groove on; lots of drunk people. My wife and I were visiting Seattle on vacation and we had a groupon for the Frontier Room. We decided to bus it up to the top of this hill and walk back into downtown. It was a nice 4 mile walk, but by the time we got to the Frontier Room, I was parched and starving. It was pretty empty for a weekend, so we got our own booth. Our waiter came out and I ordered a cheap domestic and it went down wonderfully. To go with it, we got some red beans and rice and a chicken Caesar salad. The BBQ chicken came out nice and moist on top of the salad and the red beans and rice were fully flavorful and not too spicy (I added some heat to my share) My wife enjoyed the red beans and rice as well. I ordered a second beer and just sucked in all the cool BBQ atmosphere and reminisced about our walk and our trip to Seattle. It was great, and the smells coming out of the kitchen tickled the olfactory. Our server was a super cool guy and it was an enjoyable meal overall. I figured the baby back ribs would taste amazing because it is one of their more popular dishes, and even though the flavor wasn't too bad, the meat was OK in terms of tenderness after wrestling it off the bone. Bring a carving knife. Just based on the food alone, I'd give this restaurant 3 stars because the food was mediocre and slightly pricy for its quality.My group had a reservation for at least 15 people and by the looks of it, the restaurant had only one large table, which they gave away to a party of about 8 walk ins shortly prior to our arrival. We arrived about 20 &#160;minutes before our reservation time when the other party just sat down at our table. The waiter asked us to split up and sit in random booths to wait for that party to finish before we could have our table because we shouldn't have arrived so early. We waited until our reservation time and they told us our table was ready... And by that they meant we were going to stay split up at the booths we were already sitting at. What's the point of us making a reservation if you're just going to give our table away and then making us wait until our time only to not give us a table? Minus one star for service. I've come here for a bachelorette party and a 40th birthday (not mine - thank god!) and both times Frontier Room did not disappoint. &#160;Short line, no cover for girls ($5 for boys), great tunes to dance to, and just a fun-loving unpretentious atmosphere.On weekends, they turn the room in the back into a dance party - and this is one DJ that keeps you coming back for more. &#160;Frontier Room isn't a club by any stretch of the imagination, but on the two Friday nights I was here - the DJ kept great tunes rolling and the dance floor was packed. &#160;A mixture of recent songs and hits from the 80s. &#160;Young crowd (which was just what my 40 year old friend wanted!) mixed in with some middle-aged folk but no creepy perverts that you find in Pioneer Square. &#160;If you're looking for an unexpected good time - this is your place. Frontier has since fixed their sound system and switched up their DJs. Excellent service, as always. Ok so when you walk in you may wonder why anyone would give this place 5 stars. It is awkwardly set up, dark and looks like it was decorated by ranchers who grew up on skid row. Simple Answer: THE FOOD. I am a BBQ snob and Seattle is starting to have some better options but nothing beats Frontier for going out. The staff is mostly friendly but can be un-attentive sometimes. I just mean that table service can be spotty in the back bar but you will be served right away if you walk up to the actual bar. It's no big deal if you go into this place with a bit of a "self starter" attitude. If you are expecting fine dining and immaculate service you will probably be disappointed. BUT that is not really what they are providing. They are providing a mellow atmosphere where you can do your own thing, have good drinks, watch a game and eat AMAZING food. I highly recommend the bacon wrapped prawns and the pulled pork sliders. Also their homemade bbq sauce is very very good. I usually do not go to Frontier late at night as I live far away but I have enjoyed many a Happy Hour there. In fact it is my #1 Happy Hour spot! The food prices are unreal (like $3 for 3 shrimp or 3 sliders- DEALS!) and the drinks are well made, with a good selection of drafts. After HH is over though the prices do get rather high. Overall if you like BBQ this place is highly recommended This is a place I never expected to like. I have been here three times for lunch, and each time I must admit I was completely satisfied. The service is always friendly and usually quick. They have several excellent beers on tap. The french fries are thin and cooked crispy with the skin. Delicious. And the salmon sandwich has never disappointed - cooked spicy and to perfection. I'll be back. i remember heading to the frontier room many, many years ago. &#160;Nirvana was in full swing, there was a espresso stand on every corner in seattle, and counter culture was anti-culture. &#160;you could go to the frontier room and have 24 hour breakfast, coffee and all of us kids would hang out till 2, smoking cigarettes and writing poetry. &#160;you'd look up at the ceiling and you can see cigarette tar from decades past, a big stain, just looking at it could give you cancer. &#160;but it was a good kind of cancer. &#160;like the type that puts out when you're both drunk enough. &#160;one found solace when the nicotine stains served as rorschachs to our chemically addled minds. &#160;it was a place for cathartic moments and the soul crushing revelation that you had a cathartic moment, draining the sublime poignancy. &#160;but even that didn't matter. &#160;there was another coffee, another cigarette. &#160;the future, however imminent, was held suspended for just one night. &#160;Now, the frontier room is some sort of barbque joint. &#160;there's 3 big tvs in the bar and you can catch up on the playoffs. &#160;belltown is host to yuppie spawn. &#160;i had some barbque there on happy hour. &#160;everything was 3 bucks. &#160;mac and cheese, ribs, delicious sliders. &#160;it was nice to look around, seeing how the frontier room changed, just like how we all changed. &#160;the frontier room sold out. &#160;but that didn't bother me. &#160;we all sold out. &#160;we could all get angry and hang on the past and be like, 'dude, remember how we made 'zines in the back of the frontier room after the mudhoney concert?' &#160;yes, those were fun times but hey, you gotta get your health insurance and retirement somehow. this place as a venue probably deserves more stars but i came here to eat and well... i'm very particular when it comes to BBQ, because its not just a sauce you can throw on something and it becomes BBQ... its damn near an art. takes time to perfect and can never be rushed.the BBQ ribs itself were a bit on the dry side - not fall off the bone texture, nor did it posses a mouth watering aroma. Just a simple - gotta pull it a bit with your teeth - chew a bunch of times - and swallow. and kinda pull back and look at the rib again asking "do i want another bite?"they even have jalapeno corn bread - which was another disappointment. more like a jalapeno mini cupcake. it didn't possess the qualities of a true corn bread - sweet yet not overly sweet - hints of spice - crumble in your mouth good. as much as i love corn bread w/ butter - a true corn bread shouldn't need butter! it should be all gone in your stomach by the time you realize you haven't used any butter!i will give the Frontier Room credit on the deep fried oysters. kind of hard to mess that up - but it was pretty on point and fairly priced as well.again - i've been to this place as a club/bar - not too shabby but when it gets packed - pray there's no fire cuz i've only seen one exit and not a whole lot of space if any to get to it.i'd be back for drinks - but not for food. This place was a decent place to start the night. $3 coors lights, and a pretty bomb hamburger made for a cheap and great way to get the night going. The waitress sorta ignored me...not sure if it was cuz I am a girl, although i think that was the reason because I had to get my guy friends to get her attention for me...lame. All in all it was ok, hopefully they'll work on that customer service... DJ Elad on Saturday is by far the best I've ever heard. I saw Victor on Thursday and he too is the shizzle. Nice place. Grabbed some food and beer and then got some dancing on. A very nice location and good vid. The pulled pork was awesome. The beer list was decent, nothing incredible. The local choices were neat. I thought the service in the dance area was typical for the that environment, terrible and lacked any courtesy, but what else is new. I like the smokelessness and the ability to eat, drink, and dance. Music wasn't very good, but whatever. The transformation from eatery to dance club is pretty cool. I've never eaten here, I've only come for here for dancing. That being said, the DJ spun some good music, mostly Top 40 with some good butt-rock thrown in. Good crowd, mostly mid to late 20's and early 30's. The security guys are polite and professional, don't try to seem like they're the coolest people in the world or anything like some bouncers. I would definitely recommend the Frontier Room for a girls or guys night out. Great place for happy hour on the patio! Yummy ribs, bacon-wrapped prawns, grilled asparagus and tasty microbrews made my day. I'll be back for dinner! The ranch hand for TWO!! For 30 bones, you get a plate the size of a semi tire full of every smoked animal. My partner and I shared it and then shared it again for breakfast, I think i just might get up in the middle of the night and finally polish it off. The sides sucked but who cares. This place makes me wish there were separate reviews for restaurants and nightclubs.DAY:By day, Frontier Room masquerades itself as a southern-style bbq restaurant. I'm no southern food connoisseur but I can tell you that the beef brisket was pretty darn delicious. The corn bread, on the other hand, was probably the worst I've ever had.NIGHT:On weekend nights, the back room transforms into a jam-packed dance floor. Think of a can of sardines. But with wriggling, alive sardines. Welcome to Frontier Room. It's not always this crowded on the dance floor, but those nights are the exception. The clientele is usually super drunk, super boisterous, and somewhat sweaty. Everyone's dressed comfortably and not typically "Belltown"; you wouldn't either if you knew you'd be walking out of there coated with spilt booze and someone else's sweat. If it weren't for the DJ, I don't know if I'd come back.I love the DJ here most of the time. It's not a proper club, so don't expect a continuous stream of hip-hop or techno beats. Instead the music ranges from B.O.B to Third Eye Blind to the Backstreet Boys to Muse.Tip: If you eat dinner here, you can get stamped to come back later. Cover tends to run $5 until midnight, $10 after. Often times there's no cover for girls, but not always. decent crowd (late 20s/30s), dance floor (Sat) was absurdly crowded (ie: breathing room only). mediocre DJ but crowd enjoys dancing. despite the 2 bars, can be impossible to get a drink here, try the backroom bar for better luck. I love Frontier Room!!! &#160;The food is always delicious and the service so friendly and attentive. &#160;They offer a great happy hour during the week, and I think it's one of the best places to go to on a Friday or Saturday night for cocktails and dancing. &#160;Thank you Frontier Room, I will be back often!
I've been ordering here for many years. &#160;I've never had an incorrect order and delivery service is always fast and polite (even when I lived up by Carkeek Park).The online ordering is SO awesome! &#160; You basically pick your pie and you can add/subtract/substitute any ingredients you want from crust thickness to sauce to cheeses to toppings. &#160; And they NEVER get it wrong.The menu is large and eclectic. &#160;There are a TON of "specialty" pizzas. &#160; &#160;Just pick one closest to the one you want and then customize it with your online ordering. &#160; &#160;They also have pasta, salad, blah blah blah. &#160;The spinach salad is pretty decent - if I worked nearby I'd have it for lunch often.I like that this restaurant invests back into the community. &#160; Also, I read that ownership leans libertarian which doesn't hurt. &#160;I must subtract a star because the quality of ingredients is mediocre and sometimes they are not described accurately either. &#160; &#160;Just order the "baby back pork ribs" and you'll know what I mean. &#160; It's more like pork buttons. &#160;They taste fine and you can't beat the price of $7 but let's not pretend we're Royal Daulton when we're Corningware. &#160; I'm probably going to sound like a snob now, but this place could really ROCK (and they could charge so much more) if they pumped up the quality to match the awesomeness of the menu choices.But I suspect their current business model works great despite snobs like me. &#160; They mimic upscale options but still keep the prices low. &#160;I like it. &#160;It's a good compromise.Perhaps I can best sum it up by saying that when it's just "us" we order Soprano's. &#160;When we have friends over, we order Pagliacci's. &#160; Does that makes sense? TERRIBLE! &#160;I ordered from Soprano's in September. &#160;The delivery driver forgot the order of garlic bread. &#160;I called and the English as a second language (funny-advertisements show guys who look pretty American... &#160;I just hate ESL communication issues over the phone...) person, who wasn't very friendly, asked me if I wanted the bread or a credit on my next order. &#160;A little presumptuous I would say... &#160;Right. &#160;Like I'm gonna try again. &#160;It isn't so much that they screwed-up. &#160;It was how they handled it. &#160;I shouldn't have to wait to get a credit on my next order. &#160;You screwed up THIS order so the credit should apply now. &#160;I just wanted the bread that I had ordered and paid for. &#160;It came an hour or so later. &#160;Since I had ordered before all of the other orders, my bread delivery should have been priority and it wasn't.The food was waaaaayy too salty to even eat and the garlic bread I'd waited for, really just wasn't worth the wait. &#160;Really??? &#160;Hot dog buns??? &#160;Sometimes even cheap food is too expensive for what it is. &#160;This was one of those times.Terrible delivery, terrible service, and most of all, terrible food. &#160;Great if you are looking for some kind of salt high but otherwise, save your blood pressure for something worthy. &#160;I'd like to give NO stars but I needed at least one to post this review.
As far as sports bars go I think Buckley's is better than most. &#160;I'm not really a fan of watching TV in bars, and the sports decor is a little over the top--but the selection of beer and food is top-notch. &#160;Plus it's a conveniently located after-work stop for my friends and I, so we keep coming back. &#160;Personally I like the new Belltown Buckley's better, but as far as I can tell the quality and service is pretty consistent between both.I finally tried their fabled french dip, which a tall bird told me is the best. &#160;It was pretty good (swiss cheese FTW), but the best? &#160;Not tonight. &#160;I was a little underwhelmed. &#160;The beef was good (no super-chewy fatty pieces) but I think I've had more flavorful au jus elsewhere. &#160;The main problem was that the fries were cold and tasted stale.I think it was just an off night because I like just about all of their other pub grub (especially the bbq burger) and they make some tasty salads too. Wells I dedicate this to you. Deep Breath... sigh... I come here a lot. Probably twice a week or more. This is the place I go for constantly great food, ie: burgers, salads (apple walnut). The staff is friendly, ALWAYS. A game is always on. AND this bar does not house 'creepers'. I can sit at the bar all night long and not once be bothered. I kinda love that. OH, and when I get there - Wells always asks, "Tilly darlin' how are you." and when I leave I get hug from him. I love that... not gonna lie. Buckleys, I know you just got a new one in Beltown - but I like the one you have and will never leave... Thanks! As far a "that's my neighborhood bar" goes, Buckley's would have to be mine. Bartenders are incredibly friendly, even if you're not a regular. And if you are a regular, you get the royal treatment... which is fine by me. Good selection of beers, and sizable portions of food (try the sweet potato fries). Also, this is college football haven in Seattle. What keeps Buckley's from receiving a solid 5-star rating is as follows:- A couple of waitresses aren't the nicest to non-regulars, and if you take more than 2 seconds to decide on your beer or food, they'll give you a "just make up your mind and I'll be back in a few", only return return 5 minutes later, already looking more disgruntled. - The menu items are just a little too expensive. I don't expect Buckley's to be priced like a dive bar, but I want it to be less than it is right now.- They always try to sea non-regulars in the worst spots (i.e. in front of the window on a scorching day, furthest from the TVs when a big game is going on). I have to give this five stars because as out of towners visiting a sports bar and finding 15 other Michigan State fans there to watch the game is somewhat ridiculous.However, we had to wait awhile to be seated due to the crazy basketball games on, but it was very fun nonetheless. &#160;We enjoyed the food, and two pitchers of beer and ended the night with some delicious shots recommended to us by our waitress. &#160;Very fun night. &#160;Cool bar in Seattle which was reminiscent of a Chicago or Michigan bar!! Buckley's is very... OK. &#160;I live up the block, but I only make it out to Buckleys every month or two. &#160;Seems pretty good for a sports bar, but since I don't really go out for the games, it's not my thing.The food is decent, nothing to write home about. &#160;Drinks are reasonably priced for the area. &#160;Good atmosphere, very chill. &#160;I'd go back, but wouldn't waste a Friday/Saturday night. &#160;Good for weeknights or sports games, mostly. A good bar with a relaxed atmosphere. &#160;Stopped here during the Seattle portion of my cross country trip (http://KananAcrossAmeric&#8230;) and we were looking for a good place to discuss the state of college football.Lots of TVs, this would be a good place to watch a football game. &#160;Good beer selection. &#160;My only knock on it is that there was no A/C (not sure if it wasn't working or if they just don't have it) and I was there during one of the record highs. For a pub - I would say the food is pretty great &#160;-- which is lucky for me since I live across the street! &#160;It's not anything like a conventional pub where you get greasy, tasteless fish &amp; chips or frozen finger foods....OR like a hooters where you get shloppy chicken wings while sitting next to some loud, obnoxious sports addict yelling in your ears. &#160;It's actually more like a nice sit-down restaurant, so there's some quality in the food served. &#160;There are TVs set up that are always defaulted to ESPN or some sports channel, so you can enjoy watching the slow-paced game of golf while munching on a sandwich. &#160;So far, I've been impressed with the fish &amp; chips, salmon sandwich, cobb salad, chicken greek salad....and.....their brownie sundae. &#160;Yes, that's right, i got dessert at a pub.....don't judge me!! &#160;If you're wondering when I'm going mention how the beers are....my post will be of NO help to you. &#160;But I've heard from people and read from other reviewers that it's great. &#160;For more info on the beers, scroll down or up for other reviewers' opinions. We have been to Buckley's on Queen Anne for both dinner and brunch/lunch and both meals have been good. The service is always friendly; the restaurant area holding a good amount of tables and space. In terms of food, I recommend any of the sandwiches, especially the reuben or burgers, with sweet potato fries. What happened on this night Horatio Krackorn "Non-Malfeasance Booch" K? &#160;All I remember is Erin is awesome, sweet potato fries, mac and cheese, fried chicken, and beer mmmmm!!!!!!!!!!! &#160;and an overload of sportscenter. Good place to watch sports and the food is pretty good too. &#160;The onion rings were great. &#160;The bar seating gave planty of TV views, which was great since the NCAA was on.The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars was because I think it is overpriced. &#160;A sandwich and beer ended up being $20, about $7 more than it should be. Pretty cool spot. &#160;We go here as we are avid Green Bay Packer fans and this is our local bar. &#160;Good sweet potato fries, breakfast is not bad either, patrons definitely put up with our shit. &#160;Good place with a variety of books on the outskirts; including RCW's which help out my sister in law school. &#160;Packers/RCW's how does a girl choose? Cute bar to hang out with friends. Loved the great service and yummy brownie Sunday. Seeing as we are now neighbors, Buckley's is becoming something of a regular stop for me. &#160;I've been there twice in the past week and have been very happy with the service both times. Last week, I stopped in one night to have a drink with a friend. &#160;We were carded! &#160;That was odd because we are both well above the age of consent and I've ordered drinks at Buckley's many times in the past and never been carded there before. &#160;No complaint here; it was just interesting. &#160;The cool things were a) the server came over a few minutes before six to ask if we wanted to order another round while it was still happy hour and b) she let us sit and gab (we'd not seen each other in over a year so had lots to say) long after our glasses were empty. I went back yesterday when we had a power outage at the office and eight of us decided to do an impromptu group lunch. &#160;They accommodated our large party immediately despite having no warning we were coming AND our server agreed to give us separate checks even though their stated policy is no separate check and an automatic gratuity charge. You keep this up, Buckley's, and I might find myself having to upgrade you to a five...
If you go during the weekday around 6:00pm, you'll get great service, because it's never crowded. &#160;Had the best kalua pig and cabbage with lomi salmon and poi. &#160;And it was great to the see the "Parking for Hawaiians Only. &#160;All Haoles will be Towed" sign hanging on the wall. Found this place by recommendation or else probably would have neva found this hidden local spot. &#160;It reminds of Kalihi, all construction, warehouses, super local. &#160;Unfortunately wasn't there on the weekends to try the malasadsas, booo! &#160;What i did was try da poi, mmm, lomi salmon, mmmmmm, mac salad, mmm, pipikaula,mmmmmmmm, and finally because it was 30 something degrees outside got saimin. &#160;Lomi was broke da mouth, something about that Washington salmon, mmmmmmm!!!!!! &#160;Pipikaula was super ono too, mmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!!Service was hawaiian, auntie covered like 10 tables. &#160;Atmosphere is family style with plenty local kine nostalgia. &#160;Mos definitely recommend this home away from home just a little bit colder. At this point I have been coming here for over 8 years and can honestly say that this is a fantastic place. &#160;Just be prepared to wait a little while for things. &#160;But, I promise you that its well worth the wait.If you are new to the Hawaiian food I would suggest an early trek on Saturday morning. &#160;Make sure to seat yourself (feel free to share a table if a two top isn't available. &#160;Just ask and most others are happy to make some room), but before you get too comfortable you better head to the front counter and grab yourself a bag of the Malasadas before they're all gone. &#160;Malasadas are homemade Hawaiian / Portuguese donuts. &#160;Then stop off at the cooler and grab a couple of cans of Hawaiian Sun fruit juices too!All of their dishes are great, but I have a few favorites that a newbie can't go wrong with. &#160;First, I would recommend the Kalua Pork and Eggs. &#160;Nothing better than pulled pork, eggs, rice and Hawaiian macaroni salad. &#160;Second, I would say try the Portuguese Sausage and eggs with rice and Hawaiian mac. &#160;Then lastly I say the Loco Moco with its wonderful gravy and hamburger patty, rice and two eggs. &#160;MMMMM... I'm getting hungry right now. &#160;Try one of these three to start out with and then venture out and try more of the menu.And don't even get me started on the bakery next door. &#160;You have to try a slice of the Guava cake. &#160;Nothing else to say about that.The best way to appreciate this place and to have a good time is to remember that its family style. &#160;Hawaiian family style to be exact. &#160;Which means you family and get treated like family... there may be a little attitude, but it comes with love... it may take awhile for the food to come, but its worth the wait... it may be a little crowded, but if you don't mind sharing a table then you'll always have a place to sit.Aloha and enjoy! Malasada's!!!!As often as possible I make a trip to get these little gems of love. But if you wake up late they will be out and none for you....Always nice people behind the counter. I've only been to the bakery portion, but I loved their cakes. I had their rainbow cake at a friend's baby shower and had to go to the bakery to get more! The cake has layers of lime, passionfruit, and guava sponge cake, with slivers of flavored jelly in between. YUM. The frosting is not too thick or sugary, and the cake itself isn't overly sweet, either. My husband likes haupia jello, and he really enjoyed their haupia cake!Update: I just had lunch there and will definitely go back again! The atmosphere reminds me of a Sunday afternoon church potluck, with people sitting in close proximity, and a motherly woman bustling back and forth, taking orders and exchanging friendly comments with customers. Their combo plates are huge--much larger than what you'd get at L&amp;L. I ordered the chicken katsu, which was a bit too oily for me, but what else could you expect when you order fried food? The combo plates come with sides of rice and salad (greens or macaroni). Their menu is pretty big...lots of appetizer and stews, plus combo plates. Man talk about taking you back to the Islands! &#160;Including the bugs!!Service really is hit and miss, more often miss with me. &#160;Been here several times, trying to luv this place, but alas, I cannot... sniff sniff.Food-wise nothing has hit the spot with me, I've ordered the Ginger Chicken twice, both times it was lacking in flavor and ended up being more like greasy chicken bits with some powered ginger shaken over it. &#160;BLAH! &#160;Mac salad was okay, but nothing like my Mom's, of course that's a hard comparison.I know making Island food is labor intensive and expensive, so finding the price range in the mid $9.00 dollar range is expected, but with such Hawaii-style service, or should I say lack of, I'll pass. &#160;Plenty attitude and stink eye served up. &#160;Plus the ants climbing up the wall and onto our table didn't help. Their food is like the down home Hawaiian cooking you received from those little hole in the wall places in Hawaii. It's a little pricey for the lunches but ... &#160;The food is DARN good! &#160;My favorites are the Lawai Crispy Ginger chicken and the fried saimin (noodles). My mouth is watering just thinking about these dishes. &#160;The Lawai Chicken quality is unpredictable. I was there on a weekend and it was delicious. On my most recent visit on a weekday early evening, I was served burned fatty chicken most of which was inedible. On the weekends they have freshly backed malasadas(donut with no hole). I'm warning you though that you need to schedule a nap after eating here because that fried food puts you in a coma - but it's all worth it. Be prepared for a long wait on the weekends for lunch - the place seemed to be packed with a lot of locals (Hawaiian kine) and their family members. &#160;Even when you get a table you will have a long wait to order and to get your food. &#160;My white friend came with me one day and enjoyed the food but wasn't too thrilled with the customer service (he said he saw non-local customers get poor service and were ignored). &#160;Sadly I noticed the same thing but when it's not busy they are nice to everyone. &#160;Call before coming. Sometimes they close early.
I have heard and read anecdotes that claim that Zatz produces the best bagel in the city, or anywhere near it. &#160;For example, they have (or had) posted in their store a story about a woman who drives from Bellevue to get her bagels there ("I cross four bridges to get my bagels!" or some such crowing). &#160;Unfortunately, I was spoiled by an upbringing in the fertile crescent of bageldom and European ethnic foods in general, New Jersey.The bagels here are passable, but they're far from outstanding. &#160;For my taste, they're a touch too reminiscent of a roll to be considered an outstanding bagel. &#160;No, they're not overly bready and awful like some "bagels" are (I'm retching right now just thinking about these insults to bageliciousness), but they're missing that je ne sais quoi that elevates a bagel from good to An Event Direct From Heaven. &#160;I have been known to gluttonously consume three or four bagels in a single sitting when dealing with the genuine article--and yes, I end up seriously regretting it all day, but right then and there, it's so worth it, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. &#160;What do you mean, carb overload? I've never been tempted to engage in such gormandizing at Zatz. &#160;Mind you, I'm not saying that these are bad bagels. &#160;I'm just not going to rave about them, and will look forward to when I visit the northeast to satisfy my deepest bagel cravings.Their "scrambagels" (bagel and egg sandwich) are pretty good, although the eggs are microwaved--which isn't a bad thing in and of itself, but means that what you're getting is just eggs, without the oil or butter with which eggs are normally cooked on the stovetop. &#160;Sure, this renders a sandwich that is a touch less unhealthy, but I'm not ordering a scrambagel for health reasons. &#160;Choosing the right cheese from their robust selection of five or so cheeses helps, too--I like cheddar. &#160;If I were an omnivore, adding some pig would probably up the flavor quotient substantially. &#160;Now that I think about it, I think if they just sprinkled a little salt and pepper in the egg slurry before microwaving it, it'd help a bit. &#160;Even with all this said, the scrambagels don't fail to satisfy a breakfasty craving when I'm not in the position or the mood to be able to do the sit down brunch thing at a more full service establishment.I do enjoy their bagel melts (e.g., veggie melt, pizza melt), although a recent price bump has pushed these into the category of questionable value, at somewhere around $5-$6, which seems obnoxious to me for a bagel with a few things thrown on it and stuck in the oven. &#160;At those prices, Mr. Bagel Proprietor, you can assume that I don't see that tip jar.Though I'm sorry to read what Ronnie mentioned about the service, I have always received pretty friendly service here, and have been here enough to suspect that attitude is the exception, not the rule. Hit Zatz up this morning after a hard night and a $50 bet gone good over at Talarico's Pizzeria. I had heard good things about this place and was looking forward to it. We got there, waited in line for a minute and it was my turn up to bat. First test: the greeting. "How ya doin?" She says, "fine, what do ya want?" &#160;Was hoping for her to ask me, but that's okay. Anyways, we figure out what I want, but she just never seemed to happy to be taking my order. Actually, the lady the came to help just after I took my order didn't seem to happy to be there in general and out of the both of them, I saw only one of them smile the entire time. Obviously I wasn't watching them the entire time, but knowing I would be at least writing about my time at Zatz, I might as well be a little more observant.  Was the food good at least? Yeah! I liked it. I got a blueberry bagel, toasted with some cream cheese on it and I had no problems eating it at all. &#160;So I guess it passed the taste test.  I'm not a BIG bagel eater, so honestly, if a person were to ask me to describe the difference between the Zatz bagel and say a safeway bagel, I might not be able to. But I know one that doesn't taste good. And I also know customer service that doesn't taste good. i worked here in 99 makin the bagels in the back,....loved itand they serve Cafe Vita coffee...the best Best (only?) bagel place in West Seattle. &#160;5* if they boiled their bagels, and didn't steam them. &#160;But hey, this isn't the east coast. :) &#160;But consistently tastey. &#160;They also have fresh challah bread on Fridays. &#160;It's yummy too!
Eh. The food was eh, the service was slow. The waitress was extremely apologetic and it was fairly busy, but not really busy enough to excuse waiting 15 minutes to order or it being so loud it was hard to talk. The drinks are overpriced, too. I guess I was so looking forward to having a little Alki pub that I am maybe more dissapointed than I should be.*Update: Went here for Sunday brunch and the Seahawks game.I guess the swell is more of a pub-y sports bar than an Irish pub. Their brunches are really good (at least the smoked Salmon scramble) and they have a soda bread that is fantastic. Great food and Guiness! Be careful which waitress you get. It's like Jeckl and Hyde: one of them is a real cranky gal and the other is adorable and friendly.Service is average, but they are quick to refill Guiness.The mini burgers are delicious! Jeeeezus some of the other stuff is overpriced though, definetly read that menu carefully. Would be a 5 based on the food really good for pub food. Beer served a proper temps. They loose the 2 points on service, always bad, always understaffed, always say if it was not for the food I would not return. I do go back, good food and Guinness make me happy.Very LOUD place, not a romantic spot for 2, prepare to yell. I live right around the corner from the Celtic Swell and rarely, if ever, venture in. Could it be the SUPER loud "acoustic" music seemingly always being played in there? (By the way, good music, but keep it below your eleven please) - It's too small with not so good acoustics and most everybody wants to talk. Hmm... maybe it's the crapshoot bartender situation. Let's see, half the time I go in, I get treated like a nuisance and get served reluctantly by a cooler-than-thou bartender who would rather flirt with some chicks at the bar than spend the 2 minutes pouring a drink. The other half of the time I get treated decently, but not enough to warrant me making it my neighborhood bar. Wait, it's gotta be that there's nothing to do there like pool or darts or games or lights or funky smells or... Anyway. Hold it. I got it. It's that the food kinda sucks. That's it. Otherwise, not bad. I guess. Can I just say this was a perfect place for a mother-daughter lunch after a rainy day of shopping. &#160;The brownie with Guiness ice cream was the proverbial icing on the cake! &#160;Definitely coming back, on another rainy day, if we ever get another one...
Not too bad. I got the combo like i usually like to. price was right and taste was dead on. Basically what i'm trying to get at is i'd go again.
My taste in music is eclectic to say the very least. &#160;On my ipod you will find Ice Cube, Beirut, McClusky, DMB (eff you), Jimmy Buffet, assorted showtunes, Amos Lee, Madonna, Minor Threat, Mary J., De La Soul, Pantera, Wings, Cocteau Twins, Johnny Cash, Slip Knot, The Dixie Chicks, Ingrid Michaelson, etc... you get the picture. &#160;Shuffle is a very spastic event for me.So, it really wasn't at all out of character for me to be in attendance at GWAR last night. Thrash makes me happy, GWAR puts on a high level, performance art caliber show and you have to know that the people watching (read: judge, point and laugh with the posse) opps were INSANE.I was not disappointed. &#160;While the opening bands SUCKED in a way that I don't care to waste my energy describing, GWAR met all my expectations and then some. Really - when else are you going to see King Prez decapitated in effigy, watch fake blood squirt out of his headless corpse into the crowd, and then see front man ODERUS URUNGUS fuck the neck hole with his giant demon cock?? &#160;NEVER, that's when.I really can't think of another venue in town that could have hosted my favorite Metal War Gods. &#160;The space is huge, anyone who lives near by is asking for excessive noise and has no right to complain (hi - the train tracks and I-5 pretty much fucked you out the gate so, STFU), and finally - the Yelper behind the bar is a king among bartenders. &#160;He whipped out my energy drinks with a panache matched by none!Upcoming shows mirror my pod nicely - who wants to go to Flogging Molly? &#160;Very sad I will be in SD for WU-TANG! &#160;No tiger style for me.
Pizza Hut Internet Delivery is uncomplicated. They take cash and credit orders. Gave me an estimated time of delivery. And emailed the receipt. Really simple.A timely delivery in rain was enough to impress me. But the delivery woman was smiling and courteous. She gave me parmesan and pepper packets. Thanks.Pizza Hut couldn't stop there.... The Veggie-Lovers Pizza came piping hot. It was adorned by tons of fresh chopped veggies like more than I expected. So much so that the sauce couldn't even peek. Fer real.And today is Pizza Hut's Wing Wednesday. Thus decided to add some boneless wings with ranch dressing to my pizza order. Too much food. But it'll make enjoyable leftovers. Also they gave me a free liter of the new Pepsi Max on top of their newly lowered pizza prices. Sinful spinster.... I am!
Eh. &#160;One of those weird hybrid places that does $10 fast food.The pho might be the best thing ever, but I doubt that I'll ever find out because I don't like ordering soup from a place that serves bad teriyaki. &#160;I view this policy as a really good rule.Japanese art on the walls, thai style offering shrines, but they spoke with (if I'm not mistaken) a hardcore rural viet accent. &#160;It was so thick, it defied my whiteboy asian language skills completely. &#160;It feels conflicted for a menu identify.Only dark meat (good thing I like dark meat, but many do not), cheap rice, and iceberg lettuce with some ginger vinaigrette for $8 isn't exactly a deal.This should be thought of as a strictly takeout place and only if you don't want to go up the hill or across the bridge. I'm shocked I have not reviewed my favorite dinner spot! &#160;Unacceptable!I'm here to share the word that this is some amazing pho. &#160;Amazing tofu! &#160;The veggie pho with veggie broth is my go-to dinner when I cannot even manage to think about cooking dinner. &#160;The teriyaki is really good too. &#160;It's all very "healthy" food. &#160;Not overly greasy or full of fillers. &#160;Just good food. &#160;Truly a hidden gem of Eastlake....but isn't all of Eastlake a hidden gem?PS, Try the shrimp fresh (not fried) spring rolls too. Ordered...Hot spicy beef &amp; onions drink Thai tea $ 11.77 tax included Wait time...4 min.Taste... FlavorfulPortion size..80% rice,10% salad, 10% beef.Customerservice...3 out of fiveOther customers in the resturant...7Will I eat here again...I'd have to be real hungry. The lady that runs the place is actually Not Korean, she's Vietnamese. For Teriyaki sauce ALL places that make their own is not always the same. Some places are very thick some are thin. For the guy complaining about the cup of extra teri sauce, just ask its not hard to. Its a waste to give an extra sauce to every cust, because not every cust is going to want it. I know I don't. Plus they have those cups for you to get yourself by the soda machine. Each time I've been there, I found no prob with the serving. Right amount of meat, right amount of sauce, if I want more I'll get some. I actually don't like the ginger for the salad, so I ask for plain salad. The pho I didn't like. But I'm gonna try again, because I think it was the ingredients I put in, and I do at times mess up putting in the ingredients. Other than that, I like it. It's nots my favorite, but it fulfills my need. Oh yes before I forget. The Spring rolls are quite excellent!****************************Update: 1/14/09So I went there yesterday just to get a Spring Roll &amp; I completely forgot to bring my wallet. I only live down the road &amp; told the regular lady I'd be right back, and she said don't worry about it. Just come back tomorrow and pay, we trust you. **Which reminds me, I need to go down there and pay, eek..So yea... my rating has changed from 4 star to 5. Still don't like the pho, but I discovered I loved the curry chicken w/salad (no dressing). Even though it was just the lady, she def hit the spot in my customer svc nit picking. As she always says "See you soon." Yes you will see me soon. All I have to say about Eastlake Teriyaki is that I'm thankful it exists so that I can indulge my extra-spicy pho cravings without having to go up to Cap Hill. I don't order anything except the chicken pho, and always to go. No complaints- plenty of chicken, noods, bean sprouts, etc. The woman who runs this place is very sweet. We always talk about how soup is best on cold and rainy days. The end!
I went here on a first date which was a tad uncomfortable anyway because we went at 8:00pm on a Saturday an the music was really loud &amp; techno-ish..which is probably ok other than we were like TOTALLY alone (haha!) Ok, enough of that mess...We just had a couple of martini's: Me- Stoli, dirty, olives..it was ok but I like 3 olives and not 2, C'mon don't be stingy!He- Had Kettle One w/ lemon. He said it was watered down..Don't really know because I didn't try it.All in all, not a bad place, but definitely not a date place (the chairs w/ the tall backs were SO hard) but the atmosphere is nice and modern, service was great, drinks ok. Me and my ladies got dressed up and &#160;went to The W Hotel Bar last Friday night. &#160;This place is definitely swanky and be prepared to come dressed to impress! &#160;On a cool side note...Fantasia Barrino was sitting in a back table with her entourage crew (I tried hard not to stare too much). =)The drinks can be pretty spendy, but luckily happy hr starts at 10 pm &#160;Mon-Fri so we enjoyed some tasty apps. &#160;Definitely try to sloppy joe's...there more like pulled pork sliders. &#160;Warning to all who may be intrigued by the 'sexy' fries....there is nothing sexy about the "sexy fry" breath you'll have after devouring them (I like to limit my garlic fry intake for a M's game at Safeco Field)! &#160;Needless to say I was a bit paranoid the rest of the evening for getting too up close and personal with anyone :) I am confused by this place... people seem to flock to it! &#160;Yes it's chic and cozy on the inside but how is a hotel bar so popular in Seattle?? &#160;For me it was totally convenience - the bf and I were too tired to venture out downtown so we decided to give the W Bar a try since we could stumble back upstairs if we needed to.The signature cocktails are definately pricey at $10 - $12 a pop. &#160;Some of the drinks are tasty - others.... not so much. &#160;If you look at the menu that's on the website it has changed since then. &#160;I had a drink that was similar to the Secret Martini (citrus vodka, lychee liquor, lemon and grapefruit juice) - that was probably one of the best drinks and came highly recommended by the bartender. &#160;There was a drink called the Bee Sting that did NOT come recommended by the bartender. &#160;I also had a cucumber-midori cocktail and I was not a fan - I just chugged $12 to get it over with... &#160;I do like that they have wasabi peas as the bar snack =). &#160;We also decided to try the W Sexy Fries (for $8 ::cry::). &#160;I'm going to have to agree with the other yelpers that although they were yummy - I'm not entirely sure what made them so sexy or worth $8... &#160;If you want to try the bar bites I'd say wait for happy hour.Seating is comfortable and cozy and if you sit in the lobby of the hotel you can also get bar service. &#160;Definately saw a couple snogging on the couch though - take it upstairs man, I'm trying to eat my Sexy fries. Had a few glasses of martinis/wines there while our stay at the hotel. &#160;It's not a big place but it's nicely decorated the W style.Truffle fries were pretty good.We only stayed for the drinks and headed off to dinner. God bless the W - room service has 14-frakking-dollar french fries and $2X burgers + automatic 22% gratuity + $4 service fee. &#160;The sheets and pillows are great. &#160;so are the views. &#160;You meet the most interesting people in the hallways. &#160;Trainwreck.Good for a stay-cation but the Ace hotel is waaaay better $-for$ and the Cyclops blows the doors off the W's bar. Shnitzel for lunch.Drinks before dinner.Nice bar for business meeting or relaxation after a long airplane ride. Happy Hour review:I was hesitant to go to the W for Happy Hour as I have been there on very crowded nights and its a bit too "sceney" for me, but a maintenance closure at Shuckers put me next door at W hotel bar for a ladies HH. I was surprised to find it very quiet on a Tuesday evening, but the Seattle Sog was pouring down, so maybe it was a quiet day.My friend and I ordered 2 specialty Cocktails (The Pear one) for $7.00 each (usually $12). And they were juicy and yummy. For bites we had the WINNING brisket sliders which come 3 to a plate (a new addiction for me), the Falafel (also 3 of them) which were a bit dry but still tasty, and finally the chicken skewers (3 of them) which seemed tasty but could have used a little dipping sauce on the side. We closed it out with another Specialty cocktail, the Chai one, but I had the bartender mix it up with some 1/2 n 1/2 to make it frothier. Honeyed and sweet. Overall the prices seemed pretty good for a HH, and the only complaint I had was no wine on the HH menu, and a dessert is always the item that is missing on happy hour menus. They need to have a sweet chocolate item on there!Fun, but quiet for this particular night, which may have worked in our favor as popular HH's run out of table space and can make it hard to order and eat the nibbles. Largest seating arrangement would have fit maybe 7-8 in the bar. The service seemed prompt enough and the bartender came out from behind the bar several times to check on us, which I always appreciate. It's dark, hip, chic and sexy. &#160;And it's in Seattle. &#160;Huh? &#160;Yes, it's the W Hotel Bar and this is my kind of place to lounge. &#160;When I have money to dispose of, I will gladly come here, sip myself silly on $12 cocktails in my Manolos and run up a tab that is worth more than my car. I wish I could rave about this W hotel but my experience wasn't the best. &#160;My bf and I went here for V-day for one night. &#160;When we got upstairs to the room I tried putting my key card in several times. &#160;We got the red light that the key wasn't working. &#160;I was so frustrated after a long road trip I just wanted to relax in the room. &#160;Then to top things off a really large and tall man open the door. &#160;He asked why I was trying to get into his room! I've stayed in many, many hotels for years and this has never happened to me. &#160;How could the front desk mess this up! My bf and I then went downstairs to change rooms and they appoligized over and over for the mix up. &#160;Then gave up 2 free drink cards for the bar area. &#160;I felt better at that point. &#160;The drinks are pricey and after that we kinda needed to drink. Then we get to our room and it was horrible! We faced a brick wall. &#160;All that money and we get a crappy room with a crappy view. &#160;I'm really not sure I'll ever stay at this location again. &#160;I did like the bar area though...
I wanted to AT LEAST take the girl that gave me a ride to the airport in Kauai the day of the Tsunami warning for a drink as a thank you (interesting how we were both from Seattle &amp; we were initially strangers). &#160;Besides the fact that we hit it off quite well.. talk about the realization of 6 degrees of separation with so many different social groups (well in some cases, it was only 2 or 3). I digress. &#160;Since Capitol Club was the girl's "Cheers", we decided to go here.Walking in, there is a downstairs and the bar is upstairs, so upstairs we went for Happy Hour.Happy Hour goes late (until 8pm) and includes certain drinks and a good variety of plates to choose from. &#160;Two that caught my eye were hummus and spinach artichoke dip.Prices for the appetizers, I saw, were anywhere from $4 to $7.I tried the spinach artichoke dip and it was served with warm pita bread and it was good!!!Dimly lit and comfortable atmosphere, it was a nice place to settle into while we got to know each other better. &#160;Add into that, when it's nice out, it has a balcony with tables to sit on... Thinking new summer place to go???Service was good and we were never patiently waiting for anything more, Lou (spelling ???) was on top of it and whenever we got close to being finished with our drinks, we were being asked if we wanted another.This is a place that will definitely come to mind to come to for Happy Hour while in the Capitol Hill area!! Was here around midnite on a friday night. &#160;Downstairs was packed, but there were seats upstairs and we landed a comfy spot on the couch. &#160;I do wish that it was arranged more U shaped, because a couple of us had to sit on the stools to crowd around the table (minor details). &#160;Staff was really good and our drinks were there in a flash. &#160;Even with the music blasting, we were able to have a conversation. &#160;We didn't try any of the food so I can't vouch. &#160;Some good people watching....some a little skech but that's part of the fun. I had a GREAT time. &#160;Food was superb. &#160;Bartender was fun and great to look at. &#160;Drinks memorable, especially the Chocolate Bacon Martini. &#160;I &#160;recommend this club to everyone who wants to have a good time. This place is a landmark Capital Hill spot. &#160;History is made here. &#160;Memories that go a long way back. &#160;I hope you stay forever - despite the yuppafication that's going on in Capital Hil. &#160;I've had dinner downstairs (a very long time ago when my bff's Alex and Matias still lived in Seattle). &#160;It was delicious then.Happy hour is where it's at. &#160;Met up recently and we ordered it up. &#160;The mussels are awesome - definitely has spice to it. &#160;Hummus plate was good. &#160;What else did we have... &#160;uh... &#160;was it calamari or something like that?Oh, they have trivia nights on Mondays. &#160;We stuck around for like 4 hours chatting away, and felt no pressure to leave or hurry up - which I appreciated. &#160;Great hang out place.LOVE hanging out there in the summers with the outdoor balcony. After dinner at ZB's, the gang headed over to Capitol Club for a going-away party. We had the private room downstairs so I never made it upstairs. The sound system was broken in the private room but it was so loud upstairs, we could hear the 80s music anyway.Our server was very nice and ran separate tabs for everyone.After wine tasting all day, the last thing I needed was booze but I decided to get a cider. They have Strongbow (on the menu, it stated it was Wyder's). I prefer the more mild, less bubbly Strongbow.We found street parking but there are lots nearby. Be aware of the panhandlers in the area. We also got stopped by an obviously underaged girl asking us to buy her beer while her passed out drunken friend was collapsed outside the door. I really don't know much about this place, except for one thing... and that thing is, perhaps, the weirdest cocktail on capitol hill... the Chocolate Bacon Martini.The Chocolate Bacon Martini is the only reason I've ever been to Capitol Club and is the reason I keep coming back. &#160;The flavors hit you in three distinct waves. &#160;First you are overwhelmed with chocolaty goodness. &#160;This is shortly replaced by an alcoholic presence - not overwhelming, just letting you know that yes, this is a cocktail, and it has not been poured lightly. &#160;Then as all other flavors subside you taste it, its as if you've just swallowed delicious bacon, but only in flavor, there is no unpleasant texture at all.There are a few variations on this cocktail that they make, I've always been there when the male bartender is there, and he adds half and half to the godiva chocolate liquor to enhance the decadence.This bacon vodka is NOT bakon - i repeat this is not the crappy &#160;'bacon flavored' vodka you can buy at the liquor store, that stuff is gross and unpleasant. &#160;This bacon flavored vodka is infused in house using fresh bacon and tasty vodka. &#160;All of the bacon solids are strained away before consumption, and it is one of the weirdest, tastiest things you can get on the hill. This is a very interesting one. I'm not sure why I didn't care for Capitol Club but I didn't. The atmosphere was alright. Nothing really set it apart besides the great band that was there. At least try it once... I've been here a handful of times over the years, and I always forget how cool this place is. &#160;Most memorable, probably, is the atmosphere -- darkly colorful, lush and exotic; low, intimate tables and benches festooned with patterned throw pillows. &#160;Just add the sweet fragrance of shisha smoke, and the illusion would be complete. &#160;And yet, somehow none of it seems contrived; there is sort of an understated casual elegance about the place that is very welcoming.It doesn't stop with ambience, though. &#160;I'm happy to say that there is plenty of substance to go along with the scads of style at the Capitol Club. &#160;We stopped in for a couple drinks before a show at the Paramount. Our bartender was one of the best I've had in Seattle; my favorite kind of bartender, actually, and in fact, allow me to gush about him for a minute. &#160;He's the one who is adept at any classic cocktail, or will even make one up for you on the spot. &#160;The one who will offer you a sample if you seem hesitant about your drink or beer order. &#160;The personable, knowledgeable one who fills you in on the history of the place and even the neighborhood, the one who chats you up freely and with whom you're on a first-name basis, exchanging handshakes at the end of the night. &#160;They don't make many like him anymore. &#160;In a culture that sometimes seems dulled by indifference, this guy was a real gem. &#160;I wish I could remember his name so I could put it in this review, but I guess you'll know him when you see him. &#160;There were some girls there that night promoting some sort of liquor, and he was both very gracious about making their coo-coo featured cocktails, and humorously candid when making fun of them.The food menu consists mostly of tapas-type dishes, which are all reasonably priced (think $7-9) under normal circumstances, and their frequent happy hours push these prices into the downright cheap bracket. &#160;Everything I've had is delicious -- I'm particularly fond of the not-too-greasy empanaditas and the bacon-wrapped dates.The downstairs is neat too, although I've only done it that way once, and it was almost ten years ago.
yes, Yes, YES!As the Cask opened in the Admiral district in 2010, I thought it would be great if this low key, dark, great beer and wine joint had some kick ass foodie type eats.Locol magically appears the next year, down on 35th street! &#160;I didn't even pray on it, it just appeared! Ambiance: 5 stars. &#160;Just enough room to sit a nice happy hour or dinner crowd. &#160;Just enough room at the bar (great long bar!). &#160;Just enough light. &#160;Just the right distance away from the tiny kitchen where all the magic happens. Just rightBeer: 5 stars. &#160;Way to go on keeping it local, and appealing to everyone! &#160;Theres always an amber, a brown, a dark, a light, a belgian, its awesome! &#160;Food: 5 stars. &#160;Rotating seasonal menu, YES! &#160;Small eats for a happy hour appetite, YES! &#160;1/2 a sammy and some soup for ten bucks, YES! &#160;Options for ordering a full meal by getting multiple items, YES! &#160;All fresh and local and amazingly delish, YES! &#160;In the fall: PUMPKIN &#160;CREME &#160;BRULE?????? &#160;YES!!!!!Resounding YES! &#160;Not to mention they keep some seasonal Leinies in the bottles just to make us midwestern folk feel even more at home. This is a great little food/wine/brew spot. Both husband and I had the field roast vegetarian sandwich - delicious. We have already decided that the next time we go we need to try the kale chips and a couple of other appetizers. The wine and beer list is impressively long but not overwhelming. We had friendly and attentive service from both of the gentleman behind the bar this evening. It is my understanding that the menu changes frequently, as a vegetarian I appreciate that their current menu is available on their website.Only 4 stars for two reasons. This was my first time at Locol so I can only speak for this one experience. The Yelp page lists music as "background". On our visit tonight they had live music (looking at their website now I see that they have it listed every Sunday and Monday they have live music). The band this evening was quite lovely. However, after we entered around 7:30 they began to set up - in and out, in and out, door open over and over with the cold wind coming into a very small joint. The seats at the bar that we had were placed literally right in front of the band "area" (my husbands back was to them). A three piece band in a tiny restaurant (including drums!), and then the gentleman working behind the bar asked them to play a little louder because the restaurant was so full. Not the best experience for the quarter of your clientele sitting at that end of the bar.2 sandwiches w/green salad and 3 beers = $33 (happy score!) After visiting Locol about about 5 times - I feel like I can really write a review. I'm going to break it down a bit.Atmosphere - Fantastic. My favorite kind, in fact. It's very small, warm, and chill. Generally good music is playing &amp; one time there was a live band. Service - At times the servers are not as attentive as I would like - But they are all very friendly. Friendliness goes a long way in my book.Food - Not typical bar food... which is a good thing. My first visit was the best one for food. I had this veggie wrap I can only describe as orgasmic. SO good. But that visit was at the end of the month... when I returned to have that wrap again - the menu had changed! In fact, aside friom the appetizers- the entrees and desserts change every month. Which is why this place cannot be a dinner staple for me. I want to know I have something I will love. HOWEVER, after all of that - I will say that in all my visits, there has always been at least one vegetarian entree option... and it's a small menu, so that's really saying a lot. Very appreciated.Drink - GREAT wine &amp; beer selection. If you don't want to worry about food -Come here after dinner for a nightcap or 2. You can still enjoy the atmosphere and friendly service. I love Locol. &#160;I went the first time with my sister who lives in the neighborhood, and I've been back countless times even though I live across town. &#160;It's my favorite neighborhood place in town, even though I don't even live in the neighborhood.Their wine selection is stellar; I enjoy their wine service (wine is served in a small carafe, which gets partly poured by the server into your glass and then you get to decide when to finish the pour). &#160;If there's a wine you're not generally crazy about (which, for me means Rose and Chardonnay) you might find a surprise or two on their menu (their current Rose is my wine of the summer... it's delicious).The appetizers are a little hit and miss -- my dining companions have been not stoked on the cheese plate (can't speak to it myself) because of the wacky preserves (a little too exotic for some cheese plate tasters palettes) and everyone loves their Kale chips, and while I love Kale chips, I'm not actually a fan of theirs, but the olive plate and Macrina bread makes a great little snack. &#160;The dinners are what really shine. &#160;I've ordered salads, specials, soups ... and every single meal has exceeded expectations. &#160;Fresh food, perfectly sized portions, delicious. &#160;And I almost said, "for the price" but that belittles the quality of the food, which continues to surprise me each time I go back.If you're served by one of the owners you're in for a treat. &#160;Occasionally the other servers aren't as engaging, but that seems to be improving too. &#160;Aside from all those points, I just enjoy being there. &#160;There's a welcoming neighborhood feel that's really accessible, the music and art are festive and fun but not overwhelming, and the place is great for a happy hour with friends or a nice dinner out with my man. &#160; &#160;All in all, I really love this place. &#160;I wish I had one *actually* in my neighborhood. Plain and simpleCool, hip, awesome service, great ambiance, great live music, yummy food. &#160;I can't say enough great things about this place. &#160;It's a hidden gem along 35th in West Seattle. LOVE.oh, and kale chips and olives, yum!!!! It's casual and classy with warm, welcoming light. Local, West Seattle art adornes the walls of the cozy space. I prefer to sit at the bar to constantly peruse the beer and wine selection to ensue my certainty when asked, "you want another?". Of course, I do. I'll have a....I enjoy being in an establishment where the help is knowledgable and friendly and, well...locals.We tried a variety of menu items, starting with kale chips. We ordered 2 sandwiches, a pulled pork horseradish sandwich and an apple, bacon, gruyere sandwich. Damn, damn, damn those are good! We also had a cask IPA, which I cannot remember the name of with our meal.Finished off the meal with a glass of wine recommmended by the bartender and it was delicious.I will go back here again and again. This an indulgence worth planning for. These people care about providing a nice, neighborhood hang out without any pretention. It's nice to be in an establishment that is bringing back the sense of community we need these days.Keep it Locol, WSEA people! Soo, after months of anticipation, we finally made it to Locol. We really love the atmosphere, and all the thought that was put into the design - especially the hanging lights with the oversize, dim filaments cosigning everyone with a convivial glow. The art on the walls is an awesome touch, and the staff are amazing and super-personable.For whatever reason, i was expecting a menu with more items - not a whole lot to choose from. &#160;My wife ordered the kale chips (interesting and crispy), which turned out to be a bad idea with my red wine, so I ordered the bread and oil. the bread was awesome, good olive oil - but I missed having a spot of balsamic vinegar in with the oil.They have a pretty decent selection of beer on tap, and a nice assortment of wines by the glass or bottle. I can see where this would be THE hangout in the area, a neighborhood bar where you can actually meet and talk with your neighbors - either before or after going out for a real meal.I'd love to go back, especially on a Sunday night for the live jazz, this would be a hoppin' joint for sure. I'm rating for the beer, not the food.Frankly, with how small the location is, I'm surprised anyone is expecting more from Loc&#246;l food wise. They attempt the foodie desire that is ever so apparent in West Seattle, and they do a fairly good job at it I would say(and my GF would probably agree).I'm not into that kind of fancy food personally, so most of the menu items don't apply to me. But with the size and location, it's great for me to be able to walk around the corner and grab a beer from their selection of local breweries.good stuff. I LOVE locol and I am almost hesitant to make that claim because I want to keep this place quite to all the West Seattle regulars. I love the monthly menu rotation and find it hard not to go on the first of each month to check out what is new. A simple food menu that actually has good, in season food. The deserts are often adventurous, but when I have tried them I have yet to be disappointed. My sole disappointment with Locol would have to be the few times the food was inconsistent. We have came early on in the month and been super excited about them menu. We headed back later on in the month to have our favorites again because we figure they would have gotten better with time and sometimes that is not the case. But don't let that distract you from venturing to Locol. AMAZING micro brews and a great wine selection. You will definitely have a hard time saying no to another drink. Another highlight of this little place is that EVERYONE that works there is rad. Keep up the work guys! This place keeps getting better and I find more and more of my paycheck going there each month. I love this place. My wife and I went here for the first time recently and both agreed that we would come back often. They have good local beers (NW, not just WA) and a good selection of wine. The atmosphere is cozy with friendly and knowledgeable service. We had some olives and the cheese plate for a snack and both were delicious. I feel that many reviews on here have unfairly attacked them on the cheese plate issue and all I have to say is go to the store and see how much it costs for really good artisan cheese (not Tillamook or Lucerne) and then you will understand how little money is made off of this dish. Try going to a nice French restaurant and getting even half this amount for twice the price. There, I said my piece in support of my new favorite bar. Have been meaning to make the journey up the hill forever to check this place out - my loss for not getting there before last night. &#160; We were greeted by one of the owners who immediately told us about their rotating tap and add ons to the wine list - informative, friendly and very welcoming!Food: &#160;Delilghtful! &#160;Kale chips were unusual, light, tasty and felt like truly an appetizer! &#160;I had the special sole with couscous which was delicious. &#160;My boyfriend had the pork tacos which were very good. &#160;Drink: &#160;Impressive. &#160;I tired the two Proleteriat cask wine pours - the white and the red. &#160;These are Walla Walla wines which are kept in the cask instead of being bottled - the best way to make sure the wines don't go bad as they never hit the air until they are poured . &#160;The white was &#160; a vigonier /roussane blend and was delicious. &#160;The red was even more amazing - a cab/syrah blend that was outstanding.Ambiance: &#160;Photos of old W. Seattle are projected on a wall - rotating art work, interesting and unusual light fixtures with funky bulbs, cool wood paneling on the walls, candles and an overall great feel. &#160;A bit warm in there on one of our few hot days, but will be cozy and comfortable once our weather turns.Summary: &#160;Shame on us for having taken so long to get to Locol. &#160;Looking forward to our next visit up the hill! Darling little place. Nice to finally have something in my neighborhood. &#160;Food is great, service is awesome, lots of beers to choose from. We went back a month after our first visit and the owner remembered us! &#160;Atmosphere nice, too. I'm definitely a fan. Best place to grab a drink in SWS. Awesome handmade bar made by the owners them selves. Went to Locol twice in a week. Great and friendly staff, good beer and good eats. They just expanded their draft beer selection to 8 taps, and have plenty of wine options. Hopefully they get their hard A license soon! West Seattle needs more watering holes and love the fact that this is not at the Junction like everything else in West Seattle seems to be. The staff is pretty knowledgeable of both the beer they serve and the food that they make. I definitely plan to make it a monthly, if not weekly place to hang! We love this place! Great atmosphere and charm, great service, awesome selection of beverages and food. Very reasonably priced. We love that we can walk here but it's also worth a drive. We will be back soon! Warm little nook with a beautiful handcrafted interior. &#160;If you are looking for a generic drinking hole with a corporate business model and tater tots on the menu, this is NOT the place for you! &#160;They celebrate unique locally crafted beer and wine. &#160;The itsy bitsy kitchen puts out simple but flavorful food. &#160;It's a great place to try something new, celebrate the northwest, and grab a pint with a friend on a rainy West Seattle day.
This is a branch of the Pho Tai that is over in Bellevue. This place took over the prime spot across from Bauhaus cofffe and Chapel that used to be an Asian joint that was too upscale/overpriced and never had anyone in it. Pho Tai fills a need for a pho shop in this neck of Capital Hill. I currently live right around the corner and this is very convenient. The pho is great and cheap. The service was quick and there were no issues at all. They also have some outside seating. I'll likely frequent this place for cheap and quick meals when I'm in a hurry. They also have other asian dishes in addition to pho. Noodles, teryaki etc.... Supercheap baguette sandwiches which I think are called Bahn Mi and come in both the vegetarian &amp; meat-filled varieties. I also tried a bubble tea. I think it was around $7 total. I wasn't feelin' the mayonnaise-y sandwich sauce, tho... it just didn't taste half as good as a Saigon Deli sandwich. Chances are I'd like the pho and probably should've stuck with that.Still, it's good to have a place which is affordable and quick... I'll likely give them another chance.The bubble tea is odd... it's more like a bubble slushy.
I admit it. &#160;I'm a bit too attached to my dog. &#160;I do not carry her in a purse or make her wear outfits (in public), but I do love to take her with me when I'm on the go. &#160;That said, you'd think I would have been to Norm's long ago. &#160;I had heard about the place for some time, but finally ventured in last month. &#160;With my four legged friend in tow, I cautiously entered Norm's. &#160;I have been in other establishments that were once dog friendly, but were no longer, so I asked if I could bring in my dog. &#160;The response was a hearty yes, and off we went. &#160;The food was typical bar fare. &#160;I had a veggie burger that they were happy to add avocado to. &#160;Mmm. &#160;The service was fine, the food was good, but the best thing about Norm's was that my little sidekick could come there with me. &#160;Probably not the best reason to give Norm 4 stars, but for a dog lover like myself, it's reason enough. I've been to Norm's for breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinks. Aside from the ultra-urban-homie-chic coolness of the 40's-in-a-bag, I'd have to say breakfast is my fave. The food is good but the best part is being able to sit there on a Sunday morning with your best 4-legged friend next to you, being treated like just another patron (or maybe even better). I was dog-sitting Gus the Golden Retriever for the weekend and Gus absolutely loves Norm's. So there was no debating our destination, Gus trumped us on the decision. This time around Gus actually got to meet the Norm (another Golden) and they really hit it off. My bonus of the day was being talked into a Bloody Mary by Belle, our server. Thanks Belle! They do their Bloody's right at Norm's, even include a couple of pickled beans! I'm giving this an extra star because it's one of the few places that actually encourages you to bring in your dog. The atmosphere is laid back biker. The food is interesting. I like the chicken chili, which includes as it's ingredients, beer and peanut butter. Hey, it works. And a smile and a kind word will go a very long way with the staff. I found it the perfect forgotten lunch spot when I want to meet up with a business buddy and don't want to worry about trying to be squeezed into a forgotten stall. My friends and I hit up Norm's virtually every Thursday for Trivia Night. The atmosphere is laid back (you'd think they would have to be if they let people bring dogs in), the dogs are usually well behaved, and the beer selection is fair.The trivia is fun ($5/team) and pretty diverse in questions (pop culture, history, sports, etc), but lately I wish they wouldn't do two Grab Bag categories (it's usually broken up into four categories: a specific topic [e.g. recently it was Stars from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the movie], I Love the 80s, and two Grab Bag categories). The food is fine (their mac and cheese is pretty tasty, and I like their turkey cranberry sandwich), but the service is kind of crappy (granted, I am going on busy Trivia Nights, but it still shouldn't take nearly half an hour to get a glass of water); hence, 3 stars from me. There's nothing 'epic' about Norm's. &#160;It's very understated, has the 'new-Fremont' vibe, for the most part. &#160;Being a new dog owner--not necessarily by choice--led me here for the first time, and I've been back a couple times since. &#160;This is certainly not a place I'd go out of my way to head to, but since it's a dog friendly environment, I return. &#160;I've found a number of items on their menu that I enjoy, and all-in-all, it's a pretty decent place with good beer on tap (which is a requirement, in my book). &#160;The staff is pretty decent, and the place can get rather packed so they do a decent job of attending to your needs. &#160;It's a typica 3-star place for me, but the dog-factor bumps it up a notch in the event I want to stop for a beer somewhere and I have canine in tow. &#160;The location of Norm's makes it a hot spot for people en route to other establishments by night, and weekend breakfast there is quite popular. &#160;Shockingly, I haven't been in there when there's been a serious abundance of dogs, but I suppose the day will come. Definitely love any place that lets you bring your pooch, &#160;Although I have not brought Maarten there my friends have brought there dog and I tell ya there is nothing like watching a Seahawk play off game with a big old Rottie waiting to grab any scrap that falls to the ground.The BLAT bacon lettuce, avocado and tomato..........delicious. &#160;One slice bread, one part bacon, one slice bread, tomato, lettuce and oh my gawd more bread. &#160;Served with fresh sliced friend potato chips. &#160;Great location, pooch friendly, a real neighborhood locale! It's fun if you're already drunk (which I was), and it's a nice idea to bring your pets to a restaurant*. I agree with the opinion that it's far too often frequented by the douche-crowd overflow from downtown or the udistrict. It's got OKAY food at best, but by far the best selling point of Norm's is that it is A -next to Roxy's, and B: sells Tallboys of PBR in a can...in a bag. * no it's not First off where else can you bring your dog or your friend's dog to get a pint and some pub grub? Not many... plus if you do, check out across the street at Railey's for a treat for your four-legged friend as well, the dog biscuits and treats are adorable and made of human grade products (if you dare). I went to Norm's last Thursday for Trivia Night which is packed, make sure you go there an hour to an hour and half before the 8 p.m. start time to have a space. They actually sell PBR, but only in 40 form! Which comes complete with a paper bag, you have to do it right!I ordered the chili cheese fries which is the highest point of comfort food in my opinion. Unlike other restaurants Norm's specializes in chicken chili which is less greasy and even more delectable. The only other place that I know that has chili this good is Sully's Snow Goose which has my favorite chili in town (turkey chili made from scratch by Sully himself!). We may not have won the trivia tourney that night, but we did indulge in a victorious "thanks for trying" brownie sundae that we split four-ways. That was victory enough for me!Oh, and yeah again for another restaurant that delivers the take home doggy bags in recycled paper products instead of styrofoam, kudos! Another reheatable treat, it was just as good in the morning. A wonderful chili cheese fries breakfast. =).
Coffee: Tastes better then the corp. stuff up the block or any of the other local shops in the area.Service: Fassil (Hope I am spelling that right) Is Fabulous, Friendly and really just the nicest barista I have had the pleasure of handing off my money to. The regulars are on a first name basis and their orders are in progress as they approach the door. &#160;Wonderful.Problems: Only one issue I have ever had, the first time I came in, I didn't realize this was a Cash Bar :-) &#160;but there is an ATM a block away.Oh and the map on this page is off, the coffee shop is on the corner of E. Olive and 12Th not 11Th.
Two stars for the decor, drinks, and staff. Great little place, yummy drinks, and the staff was attentive and friendly.0 stars for the food, which was absolutely terrible. We had the pork fried rice, broccoli beef, pork bao, and general's chicken. Any flavor that existed was completely off, the food was greasy in a bad way, and all in all awful. A total bummer, because we could really use a great Americanized-Chinese place (especially with delivery) on the hill. I've been waiting for Lucky 8 to open and was excited to try it when the opportunity finally arose. &#160;I was pretty hungry when I went, and had been warned about the small portion size, so I ordered an appetizer and an entree - veggie chow mein and shiitake bao. Unfortunately, the critics seem to be spot-on so far. &#160;The chow mein was suuuuper oily. &#160;I was luckily in the mood for that kind of dish but the grease would turn my stomach most days. &#160;The bao was quite good, but I'd been in the mood for spring rolls. &#160;The online menu says that they have vegetarian rolls but the in-store menu only had them with chicken. &#160; Hopefully they'll get the two menus to match up soon. &#160;I love chow mein, but wasn't impressed with the other veggie offerings. &#160;(I'm not actually sure that there were other options for vegetarians, come to think of it.) There was one tofu dish on the menu...but it had beef in it, and it sounded like the kind of thing that they couldn't just take the beef out. &#160;I would have walked away from the experience and been fine with it, had the meal not been quite as expensive as it was. &#160;I could eat better for half that at a dozen other places in the immediate area. &#160;I'm giving them 3 stars because they're new, and still figuring things out, and will hopefully up the portion sizes or lower their prices. &#160;I'm guessing that if they don't, they won't be in business too much longer. No flavor. Extremely Small portions. Disorganized and confused service considering the small size of the restaurant. Regarding the ridiculous portion size of the plates im surprised to hear they will be offering delivery.... What exactly do they plan to deliver? &#160;Half empty boxes?I ordered a diet coke and was brought ginger beer. When I let our server know,he said it was diet, but it had like 40 grams of sugar! When I pointed this out to him he just said its advertised as diet...ok. Well its not diet. If i was diabetic it would be a problem. My friend ordered iced tea but they do not have iced tea. ?? Ok. We ordered and once again i have to say the portion sizes were super tiny! There was four of us and we had 3 apps. And 4 entrees ( one of them didnt come until we were leaving) and we all left still hungry and disappointed in the entire experience. I always associate chinese food with sharing family style but here we all ordered an entree and it still was not enough. The only saving grace would have been the taste of the food and sadly we were ambivalent.... Not terrible, not good, not really anything. &#160;I felt nothing about this food. Our server said our missing entree would be up shortly and we waited but it just got to the point where we were all a little tired of this place... Check please. &#160;I told the server we couldn't wait any longer and he literally said " ok give me your cards" &#160;excuse me? Can we at least SEE the bill? What is With this place?Everyone at this table works in customer service so we make it a point to be patient and kind. We are not the people who go out to eat and treat everyone like crap. things happen when you go out to eat, especially at a new restaurant, but this &#160;place was really testing us. Our server did not help. You would think after an entree fails to reach a table the owner or manager would visit, but no...so another ball dropped and another opportunity to smooth out the situation was missed. They did comp. one of our appetizers which was nice of them. &#160;I'm sure some people will love this place and they will find their niche, but its just not for me. I realize, as many others have noted, that this is still within a week or two of their opening, so I am trying to keep this in mind with the review. It was "ok" - My friend and I did a sampling of food and it just feels like the recipes are still not quite there. (Which is sad because I was really looking forward to some amazing Chinese food on the Hill.)The General's Chicken felt almost tofu-like to the tongue and very sweet with almost no spice. The bbq pork fried rice needed salt (and I very rarely salt anything) and seemed to lack the taste of the pork and instead was very egg-y. The chow mein was greasy with thin noodles and the beef on top seemed to lack general taste and flavor.I also tried to order a diet soda and was informed they did not have diet sodas. When a place has what seems to be a full bar but only Mexican Coke and no diet to choose from, it continues to make me question the level of detail to their food and drink menus. I mean, the place looks amazing, but a restaurant will live and die by its food (primarily) and drink options. In addition, my friend thought the water we had at the table seemed to taste soapy. I might try again in six months or so - when they have had time to upgrade their menu from where it currently stands. Definitely not "comfort" chinese food and more about throwing up recipes in the air and seeing what sticks. Unfortunately, very little is making the grade for what seems to be a rather inflated price.*One side note for those looking for other options - Pinto Thai Bistro on Broadway has a Broccoli and Oyster Sauce dish (you pick the meat) and a Vegetable Delight (again, you pick the meat) dish that tastes far more like the "comfort" chinese food I grew up with in the midwest. If I need my fix, I'll continue going there. (Plus, it is less expensive than Lucky 8's with a larger dinner serving size.) Ugh. Despite the reviews, I ventured off to Lucky 8 to see for myself what this place was about. Like everyone else, I wanted this place to be great. Americanized Chinese in capitol hill would be great...if done properly. Unfortunately, this place better have some serious changes in order or they'll be gone in a matter of months like the short lived Varro. The decor was nice and the staff were friendly but the food was pathetic. I do not consider myself to be a culinary master or anything but this food really was just plain terrible, there's no other way to describe it...The chow mein, spicy beef noodles and kung pao chicken were all extremely bland. Literally, no flavor. Additionally, the spicy beef and kung pao were soaked in grease. Finally the quality of meat was a huge disappointment to me. I prefer white meat and typically stay away from thigh meat. If this place wants to make it they need an entire new game plan, new menu, or new chef (or all of the above). I hope this place survives because a quality Americanized Chinese restaurant in cap hill (that delivers) would be awesome. One star for the decor, the other for the food.Ok service, terrible food.Pork bao was ok but bland, General's was just plain gross. Tasted like fried grease, and not in a good way.Could have been so much better judging by the menu.Friends got other dishes that weren't even as good.Pork fried rice was too smoky, "spicy" noodles were no such thing.I only hope they'll do better. Overall an excellent experience. The customer service is absolutely top notch and the food is good. I was with a group of 7 and they treated us extremely well. There was a snafu in the time they told us we'd have to wait so while we waited they gave first drinks on the house. They also provided us some apps. The food was good. I had general tsao's chicken which was very flavorful. My bf had Kung Pao chicken which was also very good although he wished there were more vegetables as in green peppers in the dish. Everyone in the group enjoyed both appetizers and main course and again - we couldn't say enough good things about the entire staff- attentive, friendly, accommodating, generous. Definitely will return! Very disappointing.Food: &#160;greasy, and not in a good way. &#160; And the order of 2 "Pork Belly Bao" arrived with one lukewarm and the other ice cold. &#160; If you're going to serve nuked food - at least get that part right!Service: friendly enough until half way through the meal, and then oddly pushy about clearing the table. &#160; Dishes and a not-yet-empty beer glass were taken without asking us if we were done.Adding a star for the fortune cookies. &#160;They were yummy. Boring and flavorless. Skimpy. Nice staff but this is another Chungees. 1 app. 2 entrees in half empty boxes for 40 dollars. Charging for rice is tacky. Do you pay for bread at a non Asian food establishment? Are you kidding me with that general tsao's chicken? Soggy breading, no crunch, no sauce, no flavor but salt. Let's get to the broccoli beef, portion size for one, has no amount of flavor and doesn't really represent what I know and love as Chinese food. Disappointing as I was looking forward to delivery! Who wants to partner up and move Shanghai garden to the hill? Good Christ. Very early to review a place, take that into account. Good: Service was attentive, eager, happy, and pretty good looking. Prices are good. Takeout is available. Delivery appears to be available as well.Neutral: The space was okay: it's kind of nice to look at, but there's not much seating and as near as I could tell it's not handicapped accessible. The kitchen was a little slow, but it was only like their second or third day of being open.Bad(ish): The food was bland. It wasn't actually bad, hence the parenthetical conditional modifier. It was just completely uninteresting. They need to punch it up a little, bring some zest to it. I should probably rate it higher because they were freshly opened and talking about any restaurant that's just opened is a little cruel. The service is top rate, but the servers talked up the food and the flavors a lot, and that didn't help when the food failed to impress. I'm going back again in a week or two, though, and see what might have changed. For now, though, it gets 3 stars for a good effort, and we'll see what they make of it. I tried this restaurant as it has taken forever to finish being built. I have watched it for months from my gym. I finally tried take out last night. The interior is very small. The decor is cool and simple but there isn't an Asian person in sight and for a Chinese restaurant that always raises a red flag. If the situation were reversed ibwould expect a more divorce staff. That being said I thought the staff was nice. My take out took a long time but they just opened on new years. Apparently the owner used to work at La Spega and another place on the hill. I ordered chow mein and I didn't are for the flavor. Chow mein is a basic staple and should be A classic but their flavor had a hint of a couple of things that did not taste very good. In addition my take out container was only 3/4 full. Usually those containers are packed. This one barely feed one person so I feel like the price is too high. The menu is limited and they have one long table for a group of 12 people or so. We have been awaiting the opening of Lucky 8's ever since we heard it was coming - hip, Chinese restaurant on the hill - finally! &#160;We were there on day 2 with a group of 10 and sat at the large communal table. &#160;The ambience is great - simply decorated with a large screen playing Bruce Lee kung fu movies. &#160;The service was friendly, attentive and very capable. &#160;The food was solid. &#160;We ordered egg rolls, pork belly hum bao, hot and sour soup and braised ribs as apps. &#160;The egg rolls and hum bao were good, but the stand outs were the hot and sour soup (not the gelatinous goo you usually get in the ID) and the braised ribs - just the right amount of marinade, just the right amount of heat, tremendous flavor. &#160;For the entrees, we ordered the fried rice, chow mein, broccoli beef, sweet and sour pork and the general tsao's chicken. &#160;Again, the food was flavorful and not overly salty or sweet. &#160;The broccoli beef was excellent, it was tender, cooked to perfection with the right amount of sauce and the broccoli was not mush. &#160;One thing that could improve, and undoubtedly will, is the timing from the kitchen. &#160;Since some of our group is in the restaurant industry, we did not mind, as these are the issues that are easy to fix - especially when you have only been open a few days. The space is cute, the staff is super nice ... now only if they had good food.I went with two friends on a Tuesday. There wasn't a lot to choose from on the menu. My friends both had the General Tsao's chicken and spring rolls; I had the scallion pancakes and pork belly buns. My friends said that the chicken dishes were oily and a little salty. The dough on my pork bun was tasty, but the inside was completely bland and tasteless -- just a little hint of salt, and that's about it. The scallion pancakes were basically just a few scallions and garlic pressed between two hard tortillas. I could have made a tastier dinner at home.I'll only give this place another try if I see that it's starting to earn consistently good reviews from other Yelpers. Oh, Lucky 8, I really wanted to like you. My fiancee and I just moved to Seattle and into the Cap Hill neighborhood, and was excited to find out that an "Americanized Chinese restaurant" was opening up. &#160;Your menu looked enticing enough so we decided to give it a try. I walked away from the experience deflated and un-satiated on multiple levels. We came in on a Tuesday night and had the 1) Scallion Pancakes, 2) Szechuan Spareribs, 3) Sweet and Spicy Beef Noodles, and 4) Baby Bok Choy (I wanted the long green beans on the menu, but it was out.). First of all, the Scallion Pancakes were just two store-bought (or at least it tasted like it) tortillas pressed together, lightly oiled and pan-fried with some chopped scallions thrown on top. I don't even remember if it came with a dipping sauce...I don't think it did. Pancake=doughy goodness, not flat crunchy tortillas. The Szechuan Spareribs were just as disappointing--the meat was tough and bland. The "Szechuan" came in as the store-bought chili garlic sauce/jelly slathered on top. The portion was right, but everything else on the dish was just all wrong. The Sweet and Spicy Beef Noodles was probably the worst of the bunch. The noodles tasted like it's been sitting in a bag on a refrigerated shelf for quite some time. I tasted no sweetness nor spiciness, but instead, I tasted....ragu. The ground beef in this dish tasted like it was rescued from last night's meat sauce from the Old Spaghetti Factory. And the Baby Bok Choy, if it was warm, would have been a 40-degree day (Ain't nobody got nothing to say about a 40-degree day). &#160;Granted, we finished everything because we hadn't eaten all day and was hungry but ended up leaving still pretty hungry. The space is cute (but isn't ADA-friendly, now that I think about it), and I like the kung-fu movie on-the-wall idea. The service was friendly and attentive (overly so, actually, as our water kept getting topped off even when it was already topped off). I like the communal table in the middle of the dining room. Now, if only you'd hire someone who can cook the food deserving of everything else you have right, then you're set.
I grew up in the central valley of California, I am Mexican in mi corazon. I have missed home made Mexican food dearly! I have read about this place constantly, but never manage to make it down to the Market in hours that it is open. My boyfriend and I both had the chorizo y huevos burrito. Which was delicious! I forgot how good real chorizo is. Way better than the stuff I get at the grocery store. We also got some pan dulce(mexican sweet bread/pastry). I was so excited to see them! They are a staple from my youth. If you have never had pan dulce, sure you aren't really missing out on much. For me though, it was all about the nostalgia. We also had some jarritos. I love jarritos! another staple of my youth. My favorite is the mandarin. We got a dozen home made tortillas that were delicious, I just made some soft tacos with them for dinner tonight. I may need to get some more soon! We also got some beef tamales. That were also very good. For store bought tortillas they were pretty dang good. As was the home made salsa they sell. Whenever I need my nostalgic mexican food fix, I will head down to the tienda in pike place. I am still on a quest to find the Perfect Burrito in Seattle.Well first off, they only accept cash. No biggie, i found a Chase ATM next door.Next, they do not serve meat in any of their freshly prepared foods as they don't have the proper permits. Burrito with no meat...eh, this is not looking good. I still got it anyways.It was fine, but it was just not even close to being that perfect burrito. Being from California, I have been spoiled when it comes to great Mexican food. Well I tried, but the search will continue. *sigh*The rating is based on my burrito experience as I have not tried any of the other foods which seem to be quite popular. This place has a lot of essentials for Mexican cooking. But what it doesn't have is great tamales. They're OK, but not the best I've had by a long shot. First, tamales are supposed to be wrapped in corn husks not paper. Come here for things you can't find in QVC, but not for the tamales.
This reveiw is just for their espresso and Baquette.Good espresso maker and good bread.Very calm atmosphere. Good place to hide out...Even from yourself;) This review is for the Cafe-I was stoked to see they have a bakery near my work because the bread (Rosemary Diamante) is some of the best Ive ever had. EVER!Which is why they get only 2 stars right now for my first visit. I love that they are using organic, high quality, product. The coffee was good, the bread was half off, but my $9 sandwich was like eating at a gas station. The Italian is a tasty sandwich. But it would be a really great sandwich if it wasn't sitting in a cooler all day getting rubbery. Honestly not as good as Subway. Until you make your sandwiches fresh, to order, Ill eat at Alki across the street. And Alki is not that great.
Loved the Murder Mystery Dinner Cruise! I had family coming from out of town, so we decided to take them on the Argosy Murder Mystery dinner cruise. If you book a few days in advance, you can nominate someone in your party to be a suspect, without that person knowing! So, we set up my sister. You fill out a questionnaire with funny quirky tidbits about that person. On our cruise, the actors were fantastic and worked the suspects info into the questioning in a fun way. &#160;The actors are from Events on the Edge and did a really good job of including the audience. If you you are looking for some really good deep healthy belly laughs for your group, this is it!This is a dinner cruise, so onto the food. We ordered the appetizer sampler, Pretzel crusted crab cakes, Artisan cheese platter and Pike Place Market vegetable platter. It was okay, we didn't care that much for the crab cakes, so if we were to do this again, would just order the Cheese and Vegi platters. &#160;The main meal is a buffet, for a buffet, it was good, nothing to write home about, but good. The salmon and clams were fresh, the pasta was good, and the asparagus was yummy. We had a couple vegetarians in our group, and they were also pleased with the selections. &#160;They also had pretty good wine choices at reasonable prices.Over all, the view is spectacular, the entertainment was great and it was a good meal. We had a really good time, and would go again for sure!
I've learned a really cool trick. Any time The Boy and I are within 1-2 blocks of this place, I casually say, "Hey, we should go back to MOD pizza someday."To which he replies, "How about right now?"And so we go. It works for several reasons:1. There is *always* time for it. Your pie is ready in less than 10 minutes. 2. They serve $1 PBR in the bottle. 3. You can't get any more economical--no matter how many toppings you add, it's still the same price.4. You don't have to worry about carrying leftovers home, because there won't be any. Not because the portions are too small, just because you're gonna need to eat the whole thing.5. Who doesn't want garlic breath for days after eating the garlic knots? Ah, man! They're at 69 reviews, so I hate to ruin it, but I just gotta review this place.Cheap, quick, delicious pizza! What more could anyone ask for?! Oh, I know: cheap PBRs and good microbrews on tap! Go here, OR ELSE. Their happy hour rocks, too.P.S. All pizza is the SAME PRICE no matter how many toppings you put on your pizza, and you can change the pizzas to be however you want them to be. Oh how I love you MOD! Dont have this in California so I took advantage when i was here. Great staff, great price, fast delicious food, good beer. What more can you ask for? located super close to campus, i always stopped by for a quick PERSONAL pizza! they got preselected pizzas but you can always make your own. the prices range from 6-8 bucks which is cheap if you ask me! definitely filling if you ask me! there is outside seating but i never sit outside cuz seattle weather is oh so pooppy all the time. A RECENT DISCOVERY: my buddy Charles B. told me about their happy hour everyday from 4-7pm which is http://bomb.com by the way!!!! $5-8 PITCHERS!!! that sh** CRAYYY!!! a group of us came in a demolished. each of us had a pitcher to ourselves. You can say we were definitely giggin walking outta the spot. lol Great concept, Good execution.Been there a couple times, always left happy that I went. What more can you ask? I've walked past MOD (apparently, it means Made On Demand, who knew?) several times, and had some time to kill (dang it rush hour traffic!). &#160;The pizza-rific aromas wafted out, the yelp reviews were good, and in I went. &#160;For $6.88 for a personal-sized (but not very small at all) pizza with unlimited toppings, you can't go wrong. &#160;Seriously, pretty dang good!I got the Lucy Sunshine (mozzarella, Parmesan, artichokes, garlic, w/ dollops of signature red sauce) with pepperoni and was pretty stoked. &#160;The pepperoni has good flavor, the crust was thin/crunchy on the edges, and the cheese combination was good. &#160;Not a big fan of the COLD red sauce on top, but it too had good flavor. &#160;It is probably prudent to mention that there isn't any red sauce spread on the crust itself, instead an olive oil is used. &#160;Still, delicious.Also, they have free wi-fi and I was able to score one of the very few few few wall outlets for my laptop. &#160;It's pretty loud for working, but kind of the vibe anyhow. &#160;I think it may get pretty packed during peak hours, but was pretty empty around 4-5 pm on a Monday. &#160;I'll absolutely be back. Mod pizza is pretty darn rad. Cheap as hell - It's $6.88 for a pizza that I can't finish (though I'm pretty tiny).The staff is always super chill and food is ready fast. Plus, you can get all the ingredients you want for no extra charge (including great stuff like artichokes and gorgonzola). Shoot, the whole pizza here costs less than just the price of topping add-ons at any other pizza place for all the stuff I get.I like to come here and get work done. It's not too quiet, not too loud, and smells good. Just wish they delivered. I sort of feel bad for all the restaurants in the University District that don't receive the attention they deserve just because they're not on the Ave where people walking by see them all the time. MOD Pizza is one of those restaurants that I pass by all the time without really knowing it because the location is kind of hidden. It's behind Magus Bookstore, next to the ivy-covered wall. This restaurant is another nice addition to the countless places near UW that offer decent food at low prices. It's not a place I would visit if I were looking for a heavy, filling meal. But for a quick bite to eat, this place definitely gets the job done.I came to this place with a friend who wanted to come here because he had a coupon. That hardly seems necessary considering how inexpensive the meal is here. For $6.88 plus tax, you can get a MOD Pizza here. It's basically your own personalized pizza with toppings of your choice, and it serves just one person. MOD actually stands for "Made on Demand," so that's a clever pun they have there. It reminds me of Subway almost, but you don't have quite as much freedom as you would at a buffet. You only get to tell the guy behind the counter what you want on the pizza, and he'll make it for you; you don't actually get to make the pizza yourself.Because I have a tendency to get greedy at Subway and at buffets (I call it getting more bang for my buck), I asked the guy whether I could theoretically get every single topping on the pizza. He said that while it was technically possible, it also meant that I would also have to get less of every topping; it would have to all fit on there, so I might only get two olives, for instance. Instead, he recommended that I only get seven or eight toppings. Otherwise, apparently it wouldn't taste like anything because there's so much stuff on there at once. Uh... okay? I don't really see how that logic works, but I'm not the pizza expert, so I just took his advice.Service was pretty quick. After making my order, they were able to put the toppings on the dough within a short amount of time. Really, the part that contributed most to the wait was the cooking of the pizza in the oven. Even then, it really didn't take that long. It just got placed in the oven with a few other pizzas and was done in a little over five minutes. From my perspective, the job didn't seem all that difficult, but again, I've only set foot in the restaurant once. After the pizza was done, it was taken out and the guy sliced it in four. He also spent a few moments inspecting it to make sure that all the toppings in the order were accounted for. I don't really see why this would be necessary after the pizza had already been made, but he explained that it was part of his job. Whatever.The pizza is quite wide and actually appears to be a decent size. I don't know why only two olives would fit on there if everything else were also included in proportion, because it looks like there's plenty of room for everything. Oh well. I'm not one to argue with restaurant staff. The biggest problem with the pizza, though, is how thin it is. I didn't take a picture showing it, but the pizza is almost paper-thin. There's really no crust, either; the consistency is more or less the same throughout. And the dough after being cooked is crispy, which I found somewhat strange for a pizza. The vast majority of the pizza's substance (and flavor, for that matter) comes from whatever toppings you order, so it would be a good idea to choose wisely so as not to ruin the whole thing.The good part is that the pizza actually does taste quite good. It's not very often that you come across a pizza that isn't good, so that may not seem like saying much. But when you consider that you're getting a fairly large platter of food for only around eight dollars, it doesn't seem so bad. However, you can get a much bigger and more filling pizza at Costco for just a few more dollars, so this one seems kind of disappointing in comparison. It's just so THIN that it's not really filling. I came here pretty hungry, and that didn't change much after I was done eating. I could have easily ordered a second one, but after thinking about how quickly the price would stack up, I decided against it. MOD Pizza is a great idea, but it feels just like light and quick snack food that doesn't really amount to a full meal. It's certainly not a bad place to visit, but I wouldn't come here expecting to be completely fed by just one pizza. I would give this ultra hip and delicious establishment five stars IF ONLY they would get with the program and acquire some real forks and knives. The plastic things they have currently don't even hold up to spearing a piece of caesar salad, or cutting through an intransigent slice. :-( Otherwise, we love coming here! It's great that you get to pick your own toppings. The pizza is just ok however. I prefer pan pizza crust rather than a thin cracker crust. The food is reasonably priced and it is pretty quick.
As a former morning coffee drinker, there's something very embarrassing about ordering a:'Tall Steamed Soy with Vanilla'Even more embarrassing when the barista yells out 'TALL VANILLA STEAMER' for everyone to hear and doesn't see anything wrong with it... but that was at Tully's and that's another story.I've been to this PCC more times than I have been into any other grocery store b/c I used to work across the street, but I've only ordered coffee a couple of times.The other afternoon while in at The PC,' I reluctantly ordered my steamed concoction. It was one of the tastiest beverages (aside form the Aquavit at Vessel) that I've had in quite some time and I've had this drink elsewhere. None of the others quite measured up.Aside from the coffee, or lack there of, I've always been a fan of their soups, their oatmeal, their salads, their COOKIES, and their roasted yam and artichoke salad (to die for). Their thai steak salad is perfectly spicy and their hot food selection is always decent.Recently, they've added self check out stations where the 'express line' (which was never very quick at lunch time) once was. Good call, I think. It was always chaotic with their two lines, but not really two lines. If you've been in for lunch, you know what I'm talking about.Anywho, when I'm in the area and I need a steamer *snickers*, I'll definitely be getting them from the folks at PCC from now on....There's just something about their steamers *ha* that keep me comin' back for more......I mean, who doesn't love a good steamer? ...Okay, I'm done. PCC? what do these letters stand for? &#160;Perfect Combination of Cheese? Place of Cool, Come on? Please don't Come in here Carnivores? Though I am not certain what the letters stand for, it is certain that their pizza is quite tasty. &#160;You can taste the quality of the cheese, sauce and toppings! I'm not so sure if i'll actually buy any other grocery... since... you know... i'm not really a hippie... i'm sure i'll come here often for their pizza. &#160;BUT i will warn you... DO NOT TRY THEIR CAULIFLOWER CURRY!!!!!! it is one of the most foul things i have ever tasted! (and that includes eating beetle when i was in korea.) seriously. yuck. *Review of the pizza from their deli*So this must be what a natural pizza taste like. You can tell that only the freshest ingredients were used. Best of all, after two slices you didn't feel too bad. The price is a bit steep, $3 a slice, but it is a good idea to treat yourself every once in awhile.Zipzap Zubidy Bop! The best PCC there is! Outdoor seating, low enough prices, hippie-dippie food, the option of self check-out, a deli...puts all other PCCs completely to shame. LOVE &#160;going here for lunch... Its always tasty, fresh food... The only reason I gave it 3 stars and not 4 is that the price is considerably high for a typical pre-made sandwich or cup of soup. If price point isnt an issue for you, definitely swing in for lunch or a no-hassle dinner sometime. I prefer their self serve and deli area whiche is awesome. Perfect for lunch! There soup is always tasty. They have awesome pizza, delicious sandwhiches, and amazing cookies. Personal recommendation - the wheat free chocolate chip cookie. I don't have a gluten intolerance, but I eat them anyways because they are just that good. Fremont is like Whole Foods but with more integrity -- for example, they try to offer a wide array of fresh produce that is actually grown locally. I still love the store, but now know to avoid the "falafel panini" in the deli section. It was bland and very bready and just... not that good. The only things working for it was that it only cost about $3.40 and that I was super hungry and almost didn't care what it tasted like. Whoever planned the "product placement" in the self check-out area is devious. They have us waiting next to a shopping cart filled with discontinued wines (on sale) and also a variety of small chocolates to choose from. I grabbed some lemony chocolate (by Jo's Candies) and it was quite good. The staff were helpful and around, which was pretty important. One of the self check-out machines kept needing "assistance" because it would "sense" some mysterious item on it after it printed your receipt (happened to me and the people who used it before me), so the staff kept having to scan their id's and clear the screen. Spendy? Yes! &#160;Fabulous? &#160;You BETCHA!! &#160; &#160;Organic food is my herion and lucky for me, &#160;I work less than a city block away from my crack deala!!! &#160;Oh Sweet organically(?) grown $2 (each) apples! &#160;For breakfast, from the hot food bar, I get: Tofu scramble and two sausage links or Ham depending and a Gingerberry Kombucha(drool)...that's right!! &#160;PCC doesn't judge. &#160;My vegan cashier doesn't give half a poo about the fact that I'm about to ingest a thick, juicy 'Natural County Beef ' burger. &#160;He still asks about my day AND does the Friday count down with me. &#160; Shop here! &#160;They even painted the place with some non toxic water based hippie paint. &#160;It's for the CHILDREN!! I love PCC. &#160;Since I work in Fremont I eat here often.I don't know what I would do without it! &#160;I love grabbing some brown rice and soup for lunch. Or the brown rice sushi they carry. I love that they always have something yummy to eat that isn't poisonous. &#160;The staff is friendly and helpful. &#160;I wish they'd add one in Everett! I really like this PCC over all the other locations, maybe because its in the coolest neighborhood in the land, or maybe its near Peet's, or maybe its because the layout inside is short and to the point. &#160;I would rather go here over Whole Foods personally since I am supporting a local co-op rather than a nationwide chain (although if I want to be more local, I can always go to Madison Market as well). &#160;I also get to use my Puget Sound Community Card, which offers a better discount. &#160; I also see more organic, locally made, fair trade products in PCC. &#160;Only taking off one star since there is not one in Capitol Hill &#160;): Made a stop here during the little cold snap and got me a chicken pesto sandwich. First, I asked for no cheese, and the girl at the deli took it off before she weighed it so I didn't have to pay for it! Then she offered to heat it up for me, which I didn't even know was an option. It was PERFECT since I was cold and hungry. Lastly, it was DELICIOUS. Really, really good, I want another one!! And this is why I keep coming back to PCC even though it certainly doesn't help me stay within my budget. I wanna try the coffee at some point too... &#160;Skip the pizza though, I've had better frozen pizza!! I really like the idea of having such wonderful food at my disposal, heck that is what got me to walk through the door in the first place. What I wasn't ready for was the price of all of that healthy stuff.My god man! If that's what it takes to be healthy then I guess i'm ok with eating all of the chemicals that were told are so bad for us. I would rate PCC as overpriced and overrated (why go there if you can go to Trader Joe's?) with two glaring exceptions: the deli and the beer selection. The hummus is great, the babaganouj is the stuff of dreams, the 22oz bottles available are local, well varied, and often on sale. &#160;These things alone are worth me making the trip over from Wallingford. Now that I live in Fremont, I can properly review PCC since I shop here at least weekly. The staff is helpful and usually in a friendly mood. They just got brand new self-check out stations, I think there are 5, and its fun to do, but be patient, we are all still learning the quircks, including the staff. If you have coupons or something odd, go to the checker line and save a little trouble and time for everyone (not like I did today...oops!).I still like the bakery and the deli, the fish is pretty good although I still wish there was a little more space so they could fancy up their seafood area like Whole Foods does. I bought a Chinook book and they got some nice coupons in em. I often still go to Whole Foods to get my meat/seafood/poultry cuz its fresher and I can pick it and have em weigh exactly what I want and wrap it and send me on my way as opposed to being stuck with whatevers in the case at PCC - and possibly having to make them unwrap, resize, and rewrap.PCC is also excellent at special orders, they actually call you back if no one can help you right away. Nice! They have a hot food bar now with breakfast stuff in the am and lunch/dinner stuff the rest of the day. Most of the time it is fresh, although they should stir some of it once in a while just for kicks n giggles (ok, and the appetizing factor).I have to also say that most of the time when I go, a guy named Kjell helps me who is absolutely sweet and helpful, good sense of humor and cute to boot! Other staff might want to smile as often as he does. Customers like it. Price not nice.I work in the neighborhood and visit at least twice a week. Their deli is great, meaning, I'm pleased to say, that it's improving a lot. The staff had a recent turnover, and the current crew is really nice.What's not nice, not nice at all, are the prices. The store is arranged with the deli on the east side and the product on the west. Everything between is a "holy shit, you're kidding me" priced disappointment. Let's say you're there to buy Triscuits and hummus. At any store on earth, you'd leave spending somewhere around $4.50. At PCC, the Triscuits are actually something hokey like "Organic Amaranth Revitalizing Squares", and cost $5 for a box. Then, the hummus is another zillion dollars. I'm not mad at them for having only hippie food, but a recent trip to Madison Market on Capitol Hill proved to me that PCC is jacking up prices for nothing. If you were ask PCCers why their food is so expensive, you'd get the typical platitude about not being able to buy in bulk, only having quality products, and how they pay their employees more than supermarkets. If that's true, why does Madison Market crrrrrush them in every department? Bottom Line: Unless you're geographically challenged, expand your horizons on groceries. There are numerous stores scattered around Seattle that do much better than PCC. PCC is one of my favorite places to go grocery shopping, or to go for a quick bite. With all of the ingredients to all of their pre-made food clearly labeled, it is food heaven for an food allergy freak such as myself. From the delicious baked goods to the always delicious (and often creative) soup bar this place is top of the list for urban grocery shopping for me. I frequent PCC pretty often as I live right up the hill. &#160;I stopped doing my regular grocery shopping here because it was just rediculously expensive, so now I make the mile trek to Fred Meyer. &#160;I still come here late night for a snack or wine or beer and if I need a quick dinner I will grab one of their already made salads which are amazing. &#160;I like that everything is local and mostly organic but if you have any kind of budget, this isn't the place for you. PCC is a beautiful store with lovely produce, healthy take-out and a delicious prepared foods department. Although they don't have a big selection of fish and meats, you can be assured they'll be safe to eat. They also have loads of self-serve bins filled with nuts, grains, pasta and snacks. And their assortment of cheeses is very nice too. For a relatively small market, it packs a lot into a little space.I especially like this PCC for it's outdoor eating area. It's generally sunny when the weather cooperates. Plus, it has some decent people-watching; not as interesting as NY or Paris, but hey, I'll take it.So if you're hungry grab some quick drinks and take-out from their wide selection of hot and cold foods. Or just grab a coffee and snack from the bar. From vegan to carnivore, this store delivers. (3.5 Stars) I'm a Whole Foods shopper, so the prices here on some items almost seem reasonable, although certainly higher than Safeway, QFC, etc.Why I love this location: &#160;I try very hard to buy local and organic - I don't have to do much label / sign reading when I'm picking out produce and/or everything else here. &#160;They have a pretty large selection of fruits and vegetables, and I really like that there are some herbs you can actually get in bunches instead of the mini-plastic packs. &#160;The bulk items section is somewhat small, but has a good "normal" stock and they offer reusable containers instead of the normal plastic bag solution.On the neutral side of things, I'm often stumped over the location of items here - often incoherent. &#160;For instance, why isn't the fresh baked bread with the packaged bread? &#160;Why isn't the cr&#232;me fra&#238;che with the sour cream - in fact, where exactly are you hiding it? &#160;I have better things to do than push my cart up and down the isles looking for things.Why I hate this location: &#160;I have never been able to get all my shopping list completely filled here; always caps out at the 75% mark and I find I have to go elsewhere for the rest. &#160;As 99.9% of the time I can fill my entire list at Whole Foods, it can make going out of my way to this location difficult to justify. &#160;Question to PCC: Why do you even bother with the meat section? &#160;This one is better than the Green Lake location, but they all suck. I know that it's local and that's great, but it's also really expensive and has very limited selection. &#160;The produce is very nice, but unlike Whole Foods, they often only offer organics (no conventional alternative if the bell peppers are 7.99/lb). &#160;And when I went there looking for some yeast to make pizza, the only option was a whole big 50 serving packet of yeast. &#160;Umm, I'm not running a bakery. &#160;And I usually opt for the non organic but hormone free milk, because I don't like the taste of Horizon and Organic Valley (my favorite in the NE) has these gross lumps in it atleast 70% of the time (in the NW). &#160;?I would estimate my groceries are about 20% more here than the same items at Whole Foods, and though the profits may go to Texas, many of the producers are also local. &#160;Plus I have about as much loyalty to the NW as I do Texas, well maybe a little more. &#160;They do have some really great unique items - their prepared salads and marinated tofus are usually delicious. &#160;And they have a great, if small cheese and olive selection. &#160;And they do have a good wine selection - if I'm headed to a party I'm pretty confident that whatever I pick up here will be more than drinkable. &#160;I do wish they sold more varieties of freshly baked bread. I have to give this place one more star. &#160;1/2-star for the cute boys walking around, and another 1/2-star for value. &#160;I just purchased a meaty-turkey, cream-cheese wrap for $2.89. &#160;With a drink it came to roughly $4.00. &#160;PCC in three words, healthy, delicious, cheap. &#160;Cheers! I love to haunt the PCC deli in Fremont.Highlights:The delicious chocolate rugelach. &#160;Pastries like pies and croissants don't normally do it for me, but this was chocolate confection rolled in a thin flaky buttery crust. &#160;It was a little like a chocolate croissant (where you know the chocolate is the best part and you just have to get through the croissant) without much of a croissant.The best carrot cake: I'm not a fan of carrot cake in general, but I picked up a giant slice from the deli for $2.75. &#160;It has a delicious cream cheese icing that I could eat by the spoonful, but the cake itself was really moist and on the dense side. &#160;The flavor was not too carroty or spicy, which is the way I like my carrot cake. &#160;This square slice is probably enough for 4 people, so I am ashamed to say that I ate the whole thing in a day. &#160;I had a crazy sugar headache afterward, so I was duly punished.Green and Black's chocolate ice cream: It's a dark chocolate ice cream that has a great chew to it - I'm a big fan of chewy textured ice creams. &#160;I've heard that the "chew" to this ice cream comes from them actually adding real chocolate to it (cocoa butter and all) instead of just cocoa powder. &#160;You can definitely taste the bittersweet chocolate, and it's slow to melt in your mouth, and never really creams or foams up on your tongue the way some ice cream does.Ciao Bella's matcha and white chocolate ice cream: like heaven in my mouth. &#160;Most matcha ice creams taste too bland and creamy to me, like a sweet cream base with a mild infusion of matcha, but this gelato had a smooth, rich texture and strong flavor. A fantastic blend of the bitter matcha and the sweet white chocolate chunks. The best commercial matcha ice cream I've ever had, and it's a gelato.
At the age of 4, I learned to use chopsticksAt the age of 5, I was an expert at the chopstick/soup spoon comboAt the age of 6, I decided my favorite foods are spicy beef noodle soup and Chinese dumplings.How does Szechuan Noodle Bowl's spicy noodle soup rank to my well seasoned taste buds? Pure excellence. The broth is flavorful, spicy, and packs a punch but not overwhelmingly so. The beef itself is slow cooked, juicy, and tender. And last but not least, the noodle are thick, handmade, and cooked to their ultimate chewy goodness.What about the dumplings?The dumplings are also handmade and reminiscent of delicious mom and pop dumplings they sell at Asian street markets. The dumpling "skin" is kneaded thick, wrapped around a nugget of pork and boiled until "al dente". Personally, I loved their dumpling dough but would have liked a little more meat to dough ratio.If you choose to visit Szechuan Noodle Bowl, don't expect any sort of fancy decor inside. The most expensive dish is $6 and it is CASH ONLY. I think this place just made pho a distant memory. Yeah, I said it. I don't even care that I don't get a complimentary cream puff here. For the first time ever, I had a noodle soup that consisted entirely of spicy Szechuan Beef Tendon and LOVED it! Healthy pieces of baby bok choy nestle on top of chunks of meat and hand cut slippery noodles in a dark brown broth that packs a hearty punch. They can cater to any level of spiciness from Weakling to Hades Status (Disclaimer: not the actual names, you know they go by stars). Their appetizers were way too "appetizing" (har dee har har) to overlook so I sampled the seaweed which was divinely reminiscent of whence it came - a little salty, a little ocean-y, Mmmm. And the pork &amp; chive dumplings? You knew some love went into them. They actually came out after the noodle soups since they're hand rolled and come served with a sour, tangy sauce - I had to take mine home since I was so stuffed! I've already made a mental note of what to try next: green onion pancakes and the chicken noodle soup. It's operations like Yelp! that get these little places noticed so they'll never disappear for lack of business. You'll just have to take your place behind me in line. OK so I have been watching the Reviews here for a while nowand I finally sent my Baby a hey lets checks this place out note, so last night he was like what time are you getting home from work I said about 5 am why? &#160;I want to check out the noodle place you sent me the note about, OK cool we can do that So I got a nap in and off we went for lunch today, now I love me some some Pho and I see the reviews saying this is better than Pho? &#160;is it better ? I don't know about that ....it is damn good in its own way, the Base for the soup it totally different, I got the Szechuan Beef Soup or the Hot Soup as they kept calling it, and it was hot I broke out a sweat, but in a good way it has nice chunks of beef, nice and tender like they had been cut off a Pot Roast, nice big pieces of baby Bok Choy, green onions and lots of hot peppers chunks floating in the broth, the best part to me was the Udon Noodles tastes like they were freshly madethey give every table a pot of Tea, I really liked that but if you want water you have to ask for it, they also have coke in a can and diet cokeI also ordered some Pork and Chive Won Tons, I really like them totally different from most places and they came out after the soup as they are made up fresh, this is not a appetiser to share type deal here these can be a meal in there self, you get a steaming plate of won tons and some dip, of course they gave us both plates so we could share them,I think they were just right with the dip my partner wanted the pork seasoned more but hey we can't all love everything as it is Delicious spicy beef noodle soup! Also, they do good handmade dumplings (the wrappers appear to be from scratch too) and green onion pancakes. Service for lunch was very fast, but make sure to bring cash because they're cash only. Don't forget to grab some coffee afterward to ward off your food coma. This place is a little out of the way from the I.D. epicenter that is Uwajimaya, but it's worth the (small) trouble to go find it, and there's nothing like a good spicy beef noodle soup on a chilly day to warm the heart.For vegetarians: there were also vegetarian dumplings that my friend had, and green onion pancakes were also an option, along with a few other things on their menu that were vegetarian (unless cooked with meat broth, but you'd have to ask about that part).P.S. Don't forget to check out the (amateur photographer?) framed photos of toy horses on the north wall of the restaurant. Teehee. I heart this place. &#160;Sweet lady serving, stunningly good veggie dumplings, and cold weather bracing chicken noodle soup with chewy noodles and fantastic broth. &#160;The green onion pancake looked stupendous too, I just let the others partake as I'm pacing myself for the holidays (and a Hawaiian vacation that will require a bikini and good self-esteem.) &#160;The dumplings are ten to a plate, and people, they are big dumplings. &#160;My friend told me that after a dumpling lunch she typically calls it a day. &#160;Personally, I would call it a week. Suckers are heavy although deelicious. Also, it's right next door to Green Leaf, which is always crowded. &#160;It makes for a good default position. &#160;Parking sucks, but what trip to the ID is not painful in that respect? This is one of the best Chinese restaurants in the chinatown/international district area. &#160;It is unique firstly in that it isn't Cantonese which is the predominant style in that area. &#160;It is unique from the other Sichuan restaurants in that most of the items seem more "homemade" and more personal. &#160;The boss lady told us that they make all their dumplings from scratch. &#160;My favorite items there are actually the cold chicken strip noodles and their dan dan noodles. &#160;Their little tapa dishes are very good as well. &#160;Definitely a must-visit in the ID and much better than most Chinese restaurants around the area. PROS: the spicy soup, the tenderness of the beef, fresh dumplings, the priceCONS: slow service (even when it's not busy) The decor is interesting--a mix of framed photos of Breyer-style model horses, Chinese paintings and flowers. The tables are functional, though most are set for groups of three. The service is quite slow, but since I only spotted two women working both front and back of the house, that's probably why. The green onion pancake was delicious! We ate it up in a flash, with the kids asking for seconds. The pork and chive dumplings needed a bit more seasoning, but they were also very tasty. Nice vinegary dipping sauce. For noodles, we shared Za Jiang Mien (aka pork with brown sauce noodles) and the spicy Szechuan beef noodle soup. Both were very good--the beef was spicy and tender. It's not particulary welcoming, in terms of decor but it sure feels like the sort of noodle joint you'd find in a back alley in Taiwan. The service, though as noted slow, was friendly and warm. A group of regulars came in while we were there and they were warmly greeted. I can't think of anything better than some fireworks and a great meal for Valentines Day. &#160;Luckily I got a bit of both when we went to Szechuan Noodle Bowl for the first time on Chinese New Years.We dined on the green onion pancakes, the pork dumplings and the amazing beef bowl w/ broth. &#160;The onion pancake was perfectly cooked and surprisingly not as oily as I thought. Crisped to perfection and exactly what i was looking for. &#160;The beef bowl was out of this world and my favorite of all the dishes...spicy and flavorful!! &#160;The pork dumplings are made to order and was a welcome end to an amazing meal.The women who served us were super friendly and the perfect accompaniment to a near perfect experience. It was around 1215PM &#160;today and only two tables occupied and I was wondering if there was a problem with the food. Thought since I was there I might as well put in a good effort. &#160;Took the table by the door because it had the fan next to it and it felt cool. Promptly I was provided a menu and a glass of water. Was not offered tea (the next group of three were offered tea). Took my cue from those who posted here: ordered green onion pancake and since I prefer chicken rather than beef I ordered the shredded chicken soup. A few minutes later the pancake arrived....yummy. 5 out of 5 stars. Then followed by my soup. 4 out of 5 stars. The broth was clear and light, really nice. Noodles were more like udon noodles. Not sure what to expect but it was great tasting. In my mind I was expecting like wonton noodle or rice noodle...not udon. But it is their recipe and they decide on what to serve with...and it was good. Three more groups showed up and then we almost had a full house. Everyone received tea but I did not. Finished every single drop of the soup and pancake. Call me glutton. Total bill was less than $10. Very well worth the 15 mile drive for a taste of good soup. However, the water tasted funny. Not crystal clear and 'sweet' as is typical Seattle water. Something musky. Overall, I would go back for the green onion pancake and maybe give it a try with the beef noodle or the wonton...next trip.Highly recommend the place. I find it hard to believe that all these people love this restaurant because every time I go there, the joint is empty. I really don't mind, because I don't have to wait long to get some of the best green onion pancakes in Seattle. Oh man, and the chicken soup with noodles has converted me from a long time Pho consumer. The beauty of this restaurant is that everything is very simple. The flavors are not complex. I talked to one of the cooks once, and the broth is made from water, chicken and ginger. BAM. Perfection in three ingredients. Do you know how many ingredients there are in Pho broth? And then you have to spice it up with five condiments, basil and sprouts? Don't get me wrong, I love my Pho....but BAM! Three ingredients and they have the best broth in Seattle. There, I said it. BEST BROTH IN SEATTLE.And the dumplings are the shit. Pork and napa cabbage with hot and spicy sauce...every time. GREEN ONION PANCAKE! &#160;That is really all I need to say. After all the fantastic reviews, I was expecting to be wowed! &#160;Maybe that was the problem b/c my expectations were definitely high. &#160;Plus side, I ordered alot of food &amp; it was really cheap. &#160;Honestly could care less about the simple decor or the smell of grease, I was there for food.. &#160;I ordered the green onion pancakes, pork &amp; chive dumplings and spicy beef tendon soup. &#160;And despite wanting to really like the place, I just wasn't bowled over. &#160;It was good, just not all that great. &#160;Maybe it was an off day, but the green onion pancake was a little too greasy and something was missing from the dumplings for me. &#160;But I don't want to dissuade anyone from going. &#160;I am absolutely certain I am biased b/c I was in Beijing w/a local who took us to a place that made amazing dim sum and by golly the best beef noodle soup I've ever tasted making everything else I taste now pale in comparison. &#160;I would go back for the soup...though not the best and quite possibly a little big for me, the broth was pretty tasty and perfect for a rainy day in Seattle or a hangover. This is my favorite place for dumplings in Seattle so far. Made fresh every day by old Chinese women you can get many different combos. I'm partial to the spicy pork and chives dumplings. I also like the green onion pancake. Don't forget to bring cash or check b/c they don't take credit cards. I read. I went. I ate, and I love.I felt this place deserves justice from "bad reviews".Here are the common things I see about people who does not like Szechuan Noodle Bowl:"Their noodle all tastes the same."Well then don't order 4 different noodle dishes, because they'll all taste the same! I think the main problem is people don't order it "spicy". &#160;Seriously people, this is a Szechuan noodle place, the food SHOULD be spicy, if it isn't spicy, it isn't Szechuan!"I don't like this type of noodle, I like Cantonese egg noodle better." While this is clearly personal preference, there is something to appreciate about the noodle has a unique texture; it is chewy and actually feels dough like - the style of fresh home-made noodle. Many people are used to certain texture and are comfortable with how certain food is (like how many bites to chew certain food), that's fine. &#160;Just don't go and say that they doing the noodles wrong. It is what it is.Aside from all that, they make some excellent dumplings. &#160;I've never seen that type of half-wrapped style of dumplings ever, and my, they are so crispy on the bottom. &#160;This place is a mom and pop place, so do not expect high class service. The parking can be really difficult, and the sitting is limited. If you complaint the menu being limited to noodles and dumplings, well... do you expect great pizza from Taco Bell? &#160;I didn't think so. &#160;When it comes to the noodles and dumplings, I'm a fan.Here's my complaint though, "Cash only, really?!?!" It's easy to get overwhelmed by the options in the International District but don't bypass this humble looking noodle house. &#160;First and foremost I must praise the price. &#160;I simply can't enjoy eating if I can't afford it but here is a place where a group can eat well and pay a little more than $5 each. &#160;The dishes aren't fancy or colorful but the namesake noodles are thick and sublime and all of the items on the menu are worth a try. &#160;Great dumplings, pancakes and of course spicy noodle soup (the spicy broth is spicy so don't go dumping in the chili sauce without tasting it and letting the slow heat to permeate your mouth). &#160;Remember to bring cash because the nearest ATM is $3 charging Bank of America 4 or 5 blocks away. &#160;On a sidenote, someone in the ID could make a lot of money by putting an ATM in their bar, store or on the street. Absolutely fantastic. The green onion pancake was perfect and the szechuan beef noodle soup was really tasty. The soup bowls are definitely big enough to split if you share an appetizer. Service was fast and friendly. &#160;I'm surprised it was so empty on a Sunday afternoon. &#160;It is cash only so be sure to bring enough. &#160;But everything is really cheap so you won't need a lot of green. &#160;Green onion pancake, potstickers and a big bowl of soup feeds 2 and costs under $20 (before tip, of course). &#160;I love this place and will definitely be back very soon! Here's a hint, don't be the white kid who can't wield chopsticks. Basically, don't be me.I got an order of the veggie dumplings with spicy sauce and a green onion pancake. Way too much food! for a grand total of 11 bucks my friend and I were able to share and be more than stuffed. The women here were so nice, bantering amongst themselves while making the dumplings. We were seated right away and delicious tea brought out just as fast.I can't wait to come back and try a noodle bowl, since this is a noodle bowl place. 5 stars for great food at a low price. Loved: the brown sauce pork noodle, the vegetable dumplings (I strongly prefer them over the meat ones), the ground chicken noodle soup, the potstickers, and the green onion pancakes. Also like: the pig ears, the cold noodles, and the various spicy noodle soups (don't usually order them since they're a bit spicy for me). If you're lucky, you'll go when the older women are making dumplings on one of the tables. Yes, the service is pretty barebones, it's cash only, and parking can be difficult, but the value here is unbeatable. warning: this place is ghetto as it getswarning: this place probably violates ten health codeswarning: service is non-existent (it's realllly chinese)Why 5 stars? the spicy sichuan beef noodles are - delicious, and the price is just right. At most noodle places, the broth is the weakest point; either lacking flavor or body - or both (tribute to top ramen). However, the broth here is very flavorful, and spicy too! Don't get turned off by how watery it looks, it packs a punch ;)While I wouldn't bring a date here ( unless she's from the motherland), this is definitely a I-want-something-warm-to-fill-me-up-now joint for friends. About 10 years ago my family was visiting family friends in Seattle and we went to the Szechuan Noodle Bowl for dinner - I remember it being authentic and delicious - with the best Spicy Beef Noodle Soup I've ever had.My Dad, Sister and I were in Seattle over the summer and my dad remembered eating at this place. We couldn't remember the name, but luckily I had YELP on my phone and typed in Noodles in Seattle and this was the 1st place to pop up - after reading reviews we knew it was the right place. YAY - it was the right place, we all ordered Spicy Beef Noodle Soup and some hot Won Tons - it was PHENOMENAL. It's exactly as we remembered it and perfect for our road trip. My dad is originally from Taiwan and he said the food was absolutely authentic. The noodles are made in the shop - fresh, as is the broth, won tons, probably everything.We made friends with the owners and were so greatful that even in this economy they are able to stay open.The prices are absolutely decent, I don't think they take credit card, but nto suprising. The 3 of us had noodles and hot won tons and I think it was only around $22 - NOT BAD! as our tummies were filled and beyond satisfied :) Browsed for cheap food thru Yelp, saw pretty good review and Noodle soup sounds good when you're COLD AND WET DURING RAIN SEASON.Before i came in the restaurant there was a sign that said "NO CREDIT CARD, CASH ONLY". So I had to the bank before I went Inside. Got the cash, went inside, small restaurant with one waitress and one old lady serving and pouring water into the cup. (about 1 large table that can fit 10 people and the rest is 10 tables of 2-4 seats in each).Menu was dropped, gave us 2 minutes, old lady gave us tea. &#160;Order the famous "GREEN ONION PANCAKE" (which is also called scallion pancakes. &#160;Famous Szechuan dumpling, beef noodle soup. &#160;Pancake came in, pretty thick, fried and crispy on the outside, about 2-4 layer of dough with scallions. &#160;Not bad for the price. - Noodle soup came after, Thick noodles with veggies and beef. &#160;Descent portion, filling, and warms your body. - Szechuan Dumpling, Yummy Yummy, but think doug that I don't like.. &#160;Sauce taste good.After all that, it came out less than 20 bucks and a warm filling Tummy!.I would recommend for vegetarians too, or people who like noodle soups. &#160;Dumplings are ok. I'm going to start with a confession. I am not really a fan of noodle-soups. *GASP!*However, I do like Szechuan Noodle Bowl's bean-thread vermicelli noodle soup very much. The crystal clear noodles come in a flavorful clear broth with chunks of beef and baby bok-choy. The namesake noodle bowl isn't bad either--which features thick-cut noodles in a spicy broth, but I just can't ever finish one. My friends and I also always have to have the green onion pancakes, which are THICK and crispy. Yum! This place was recommended to me for their homemade dumplings. First time I went there I tried won ton with noodle soup. The won tons were the best I've ever had but noodles were a little bland. Next time I've ordered pork dumplings and green onion pancake. The meal was so delicious it was hard to put down chopsticks. The portions are big (10 pieces per portion) so it's a good idea to share.One minor inconvenience: they don't take credit cards, so make sure you have enough cash before you order:) It's like eating at my aunt's house.This place is such a hole in the wall. I was reluctant to try it for a while, but I'm SO GLAD I did. I have not been able to find a place that serves better Chinese Beef Soup! The noodles are as long as my arm, I don't know for sure, but they gotta be handmade. On several occasions the ladies here set up a wonton table and all gather to roll out and fill the dumplings... it reminds me of my aunties all gathering together to stuff dumplings and gossip. The menu is pretty short so I've tried nearly everything now. I LOVE IT ALL!Now I live in Denver. The only place I've found here serves everything outa a package. You don't know how good you got it! This place is great. If I ever get back to Seattle... this is my first stop! &#160;Muckleshoot will be my second. lol.ProsGREAT FOODCheap pricesCozy place... (aka hole in wall)ConsParking!!! God Damn ID!!!I don't think they accept Credit Cards (maybe they changed that) Simple restaurant which basically does what it says-- noodle. &#160;Menu is only a handful of noodle dishes plus a couple other small dishes. &#160;Very basic fare. &#160;The noodles are obviously the highlight-- home made and pretty good. &#160;Also cheap. &#160;I had to order the green onion pancakes after the raves, but was kind of ho-hum about them. &#160;No credit cards so I had to run to the nearest ATM a few blocks away. &#160;I see a lot of 5-star reviews here and find myself wondering about that. &#160;I mean, it was simple, good, and cheap, but... &#160;really? Been going to greenleaf for a long time and finally decided to go check this out (since they are right next to each other). The pickled cabbage and pork soup I had was tasty and had lots of chinese broccoli thrown in, but was a bit light on the pork and pickled vegetable side. Despite this, I finished the entire things, including all the noodles - I was hungry. The pancake here is unique - thick and fluffy on the inside with a crispy skin. No sauce is served with it like at other place (e.g. seven stars pepper). Pleasant service. No frills. I might try them again, even if it is just for the pancake. I love thier vegetarian spinach &amp; tofu dumplings with spicy sauce. &#160;They also have a vegetable noodle soup that I haven't tried yet. &#160;Am glad there is a handmade dumpling place that also caters to vegetarians.My mom had beef with rice yesterday &amp; it smelled good (I used to eat meat). &#160;She said that the texture of the beef was perfect.I think the quality can vary a little, depending on visit. &#160;Last week when I went, it seemed better quality &amp; more fresh than when I went yesterday. &#160;It was still pretty good, though. Here is my order (vegetarian/vegan)green onion pancakeveggie dumplings/potstickers in spicy sauceveggie noodle soup (contains only bok choi and fat noodles in slightly peanutty broth, good with chili sauce)boiled paenuts (anise?)Used to be $15, serves 3. The price went up slightly i think, but still more than your money's worth! Ordered a spicy beef noodle soup and a brown beef noodle soup. The chunks of beef were pretty tasty. However, the thick noodles were too soft since they were probably pre-cooked. The soup had a little sour taste which is really different from others I had before. I also ordered their spicy wontons which aren't that spicy and also had a little sour taste in it. Overall the food isn't that bad. Portions are perfect for me but a little small for my husband. It's a small place that accepts cash only so make sure you bring some cash. Their prices are cheaper than similar restaurants. I would go again but probably try something else like their homemade dumplings.
I had avoided this place many times, just based on the exterior. But the inside is a bright and shiny different story. I think the other reviewers had it right--fast, friendly service, the toppings bar is a great idea, and the broth is kind of bland (but you can jazz it up with the plethora of goodies at the bar. Yes, I said "plethora".)I did like the veggie pho because it had broccoli and a couple of other unexpected veggies in it. My husband works in the International District and was satisfied, but a little let down by the lack of flavor.I'd still say I'm a fan because it's quick, cheap, filling, healthy, and the best option (for all of the above reasons) for dinner when we're coming back from Magnolia on a weekday evening. Its wonderful having a great Vietnamese and PHO place in Magnolia! &#160;really appreciate that there are also other great items on the menu in addition to Pho when the family feels like some variety. Korean pho? &#160;They have wifi! &#160;Open til 9
Easily my favorite Thai restaurant in u-district. &#160;I always get the combo special, which contains curry, pad thai, and an egg roll.You get 20% off if you pay with cash.I used to come here often to eat dinner with close friends of mine, so this place has always brought back great memories. &#160;However, a fire in the building has put this place out of business for quite some time. &#160;:(I hope it opens up again soon! Friendly staff and good food. We ordered a pad thai and a panang curry. Both were not overly sweet and beautifully seasoned, and the curry had that nice kick to it. Pad thai noodles were bouncy like I hoped, not sticky or gummy.It's next door to a Korean place and a little underground; I had a little bit of a hard time finding it.We also got the Thai iced tea, and it tasted like a nice Thai iced tea. I don't know much about that...sorry. I used to come here pretty frequently when I was a student at UW and I usually ordered the popular combo which comes with curry, rice, and phad thai. But last night I came here with a group of friends and tried something new:Five Spice Chicken Noodle Soup: Very filling and my new favorite! They use the same noodles as pho and the soup base tastes very Vietnamese. It was def. much more filling than the combo since I was so full and my friends had to finish my dish after they ate theirs. They give you a lot of chicken and it also includes bean sprouts, onions, and cilantro as well. If you like pho, this is very similar and would be a good alternative to all of the pho restaurants on the ave.My total came out to be $9.00 with tax and tip which is cheaper than the combo that my friends ordered (about $10 with tip and tax) and I think it's more filling as well. I've never had to wait for a table here and it's usually always empty, most likely because it's off the ave and a little hard to find. If you're walking down the ave and turn right on 42nd, make sure you follow the signs on the street so you know where to turn! The restaurant is pretty big so this would be a good place if you have a large group. We had 7 people last night and they were able to put a table together for us right away.A reason why I don't give this place 5 stars is because of the atmosphere inside the restaurant. It is quite dreary/dark and pretty old. The restrooms are dark and a little scary as well! But you can't expect much on the ave, right?! This review doesn't do this place justice. Definitely my favorite place to eat on the Ave, even though 95% of the time I get it to go. I've only had the 5-star chicken pad thai, but it's so delicious that I refuse to stray from it...Staff is always friendly, everything is fresh, and the fish tank is always an added entertainment factor, especially when you're with easily amused friends. This place is really nice! I would definitely say that Thai food is my favorite type of food so I've eaten a lot of it. I ordered tofu pad thai (sometimes I get mild, sometimes I get medium... but that's really spicy to me!), you get it quite quickly! The people are very nice. Even though the atmosphere isn't super fancy, it's very good. They took 20% off of the bill if we paid with cash. It's okay...At least I can eat some fried veggies! God! Those asian foods made me feel really &#160;warm, I think I would eat there a lot in the future. This restaurant is a little hidden since it's kinda underground and you have to go down some stairs to get to it, but it's pretty good and cheap for college students! Come with cash and you can get 20% off your bill! I only paid $8.25 for a beef pad thai, tax, and tip! My pad thai was pretty good but I liked my friend's pad see ew even better! That's what I'll be getting next time! Another generally okay Thai place on the Ave. &#160;Nothing great but nothing terrible either. From the moment I walked in I was disappointed in myself for not trying this place earlier. Walking by it a million times it's barely noticeable from the outside being that it's tucked away inside of the building with the korean tofu house next door stealing the show. However this restaurant is quite big and spacious inside and is very welcoming. The manager greeted us promptly and was very cordial throughout the meal. My friend and I ordered the spring rolls for an appetizer. A bit marked up on the price but you can't really blame them. The spring rolls were delicious, crispy, tasty and fresh. I ordered the chicken pad thai and my friend got the chicken tom yum soup. His soup was pretty spicy and sour and my noodles were a bit on the saucy end but I really liked it either way. They also gave us a 20 percent discount for cash and for some anniversary of theirs. Nonethless it was a good experience I really liked it...especially because I wasn't expecting much from what it looks like from outside (nothing). i am sooo so upset that the place is temporarily closed for now. they were celebrating their 20th anniversary since last month until it got on fire, and they had to make a huge renovation to the place. when the place is open again, i will order their CRAB NOODLE dish for sure! i am craving for it soo bad! :( The first two times I went to Little Thai, I thought it was the greatest thing ever in the U District. For as many Thai places as there are on the Ave, not many of them are OMFG MUST DEVOUR THIS PAD THAI NOW BECAUSE IT IS SO GOOD AND IT MIGHT GROWS LEGS AND ESCAPE.But I'm never going back. I'm a vegetarian and I do not eat meat. I specifically ordered pad Thai with tofu and no meat. I always say "no meat" when I order things because I'd rather be redundant than to eat meat.The last time I went, things were just peachy at the restaurant. I got a box because I can never eat the entire plate in one sitting. The next day I am like "I will have pad thai for breakfast."Except I can't - because there is a piece of chicken in my pad thai! I must have missed it as I was putting it into the box or something. Just gross!So I am not coming back. I really wanted this place to work out but I can't take my chances. Fabulous!! &#160;Thank goodness they're open again!! &#160;Everything's just as it should be again... &#160;all the wonderful food, and my favorite dish exactly as it always used to be. &#160;The whole staff is present, and as lovely as before... the beautiful old furnishings all there, but gorgeously refinished. &#160;How I love Little Thai... Never knew this place was here, and it's not like that can happen. I know the Ave like the back of my hand, but this hidden gem was a great find thanks to Yelp. It is in between Brooklyn and the Ave, so I suppose there's not so much foot traffic. Descending downwards to a relative
I remember coming here as a wide-eyed 8 year old -- fresh from just reading the "Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe" and excited to taste this mystical, magical treat. My father held my hand leading me through the market and up to the counter while I stared mouth agape at the pink and orange hued goodies. &#160;I remember excitedly popping a piece in my mouth... and being instantly disappointed. I hated it. It had nuts in it and "tasted groddy." My Dad happily ate the rest and I pouted all the way back home...I'm happy to say my taste-buds have developed since then to actually like nuts and more subtly-sweet snacks. Im also happy this place is still there to offer me so many flavors of turkish delight to keep me forever indecisive and coming back whenever the mood or a particular bout of nostalgia hits me. Towards the edge of Pike Place Market is Turkish Delight. &#160;They're on the Seattle Foodie 100 list.Last December, I had some of the fruit flavored Turkish Delights. &#160;They were delicious! &#160;We went back to get some more a couple of months later, and they only had ones with nuts in them. &#160;They were quite tasty too, but I have to say I prefer the fruit ones.I decided to stop by again this December, and I found out that they don't make the Turkish Delights in house. &#160;Wait, what? &#160;Your signature dish that your business is named after -- they're not made fresh and in house? &#160;Odd... But, whatever. &#160;They're still awesome! &#160;They have a Turkish friend who makes them offsite and ships them in. &#160;Apparently he got really busy over the holidays, and he didn't have time to make the fruit flavored ones. &#160;Boo! :(They definitely earn their spot on the Seattle Foodie 100 list though. &#160;They were delicious! &#160;They run about $17/lb, and a whole pound will last a long while.Bring cash. Good food but rather expensive for lunch! You're looking at $10 per person at least. That being said, the portion sizes are hefty. I ordered the Chicken Kebab sandwich and watched in awe as the lady behind the counter started carving chicken off the rotisserie and didn't stop for a long while. The chicken was flavorful too! I skipped the pita bread as it wasn't that exciting. It was better and more filling (and healthier too!) to just eat it as a salad. The Turkish delights were interesting but not my cup of tea. Good to try though. I've wanted to see what all the fuss was about since I heard about it from the Chronicles or Narnia. Good but not enough to enslave myself to the White Witch for, that's for sure.They were out of beef items and also their lentil soup which was a pity. I wanted to try their beef pastry as it sounded really quite yummy. Guess I'll have to try again some time! The chicken doner kebab was DELISH! I was expecting more of a kebab but it was a pita wrap with was good! $11.75 per wrap was a bit pricey but it sure was good! With the location this is for sure aimed at tourists, but it was a solid lunch offering with good food. First time and will go back...best part was talking with the lady behind the counter about Turkey...lentil soup was very good and the borek I had was good...the Turkish delights are a little on the "perfumy" side for me but nicely ethnic. &#160;My first real Turkish coffee and really enjoyed it. &#160;Cost rating is really $$, not $ but it's still fun and interesting for the price.
****HAPPY HOUR REVIEW**** &#160;Sazerac has the best happy hour times, going til 8 at night, which is unlike most others that typically end at 6. &#160;We went on a Saturday night, for a pre-funk and quick bite to eat before going out to a club for my birthday. &#160;Get the wood fired pizza, fried chicken livers, and bacon wrapped dates with balsamic reduction. &#160;One of the few places in Seattle to find fancy fried chicken livers, and these do not disappoint.The drinks came out fast and were strong and tasty. &#160;The atmosphere is open, plush and swanky. &#160;The Happy Hour/Bar area is not like sitting at a restaurant, but more informal, but still high end; like eating in your rich friend's living room.Although I've never eaten here for a dinner, this is one of the best happy hours I've ever experienced. GO GO GO!!! Before we went to a show at the 5th Avenue Theatre last Thursday night we grabbed dinner at Sazerac because it's right around the corner. My husband and sister hadn't been there before but it's one of my favorites because the food is delicious and the happy hour menu is available in both the bar and the restaurant daily from 4pm to 8pm. It's also usually relatively easy to get a table without much of a wait.My sister arrived early and got us a table by the window so we could people watch and chat while we waited for my husband to arrive. Our waitress was incredibly nice and accomodating about the fact that our party kept arriving at different times. My husband found the menu to be a little "fancy" for his taste and instead of ordering small bites from the happy hour menu he decided on the Special Grind Burger with cheddar and crispy bacon, cabernet onions, housemade pickles, and hand-cut fries for $16. My sister and I opted to share a few things from the happy hour menu... Deviled Eggs with smoked ham and jalapeno: $4, Crispy "Truffles" with yukon potato, truffle cheese and truffle aioli: $7, and Little Cheese Burgers "Deluxe" with cheddar, lettuce,tomato and garlic aioli: $5. I really liked sharing the small plates because it left just enough room for dessert... Watermelon blackberry house-churned sorbet - $6 and Ooey gooey chocolate cake with pouring cream - $8.We really went all out with drinks, food and dessert so we ended up spending about $75 before tip for three people. Not the cheapest happy hour in the city but the food is so delicious, happy hour goes late, and you never have to wait for a table, which keeps Sazerac pretty high up on my list of favorite Seattle happy hour locations. Yum. My friends and I were lucky enough to dine at Sazerac a few times because we were staying at the Kimpton Hotel. &#160;The hotel gave us breakfast tickets to use at the restaurant. &#160;Lucky for us, we were able to combine tickets if we missed breakfast one day!Service here is usually slow, &#160;the first time we came here we all got the continental breakfast ($11) which came with croissant, jam, and butter along with juice, coffee, or tea. &#160; The croissant was pretty big when it came out, and it was good flakey and buttery without even needing any more butter or jam added to it. The second time I came here and ordered their Two Eggs Any Style breakfast ($13) . &#160; This came out in a huge plate with a ton of food on it. &#160;In addition to that, I also ordered a very well made B-52 which came with Kahlua, Bailey's, Grand Marnier, and coffee. ($8).Out of everything that was ordered in our group, the B-52 came out super last. &#160;:/So... the food here is good, but expect to be here awhile because the service is slow.. like molasses. Food is so-so, atmosphere is pretty good, prices are a bit high, portions are underwhelming.Andouille sausage - not much food therebeet salad - girl's tend to like itsweet potato fries w/ cheese sauce, tartar sauce and ketchup - YUM!Sangria - terrible!If you want to impress a girl by taking her somewhere hip and a bit overpriced for happy hour, this may be your place. &#160;If you want quality food, I'd go elsewhere. We came here for happy hour after getting terrible service at Elliots. Their happy hour goes until 7! Woo hoo! The service was fab, we got to sit out on their little patio and the food was DELICIOUS!Things you must try:The mushrooms in sherry in garlic-best thing we got! Order a little bread to sop up the extra sauce after you finish the mushrooms-you won't be sad.Grilled Cheese bites with tomato sauce-you can't really go wrong with grilled cheese bites.3(4?) Cheese Pizza-SOOOO good and vegetarian!Love this spot-will be coming back! Sazerac is much more than just Happy Hour! &#160;Sunday evening quieter than a typical after work crowd provides wonderful dinner experience. &#160;Fresh halibut with seasonal vegetable mix with a hint of dill and fresh lemon was just perfect. my companion enjoyed a quail egg pizza that was a delight. Dinner at Sazerac is a treat, thank you to Eric and Harold. We were a large party with out of town guests and thought to try this restaurant. The service was pleasant but forgetful. Could not remember who ordered what. Wrong food and drink orders came out a few times.Drinks were fine but I have had way better mojito's elsewhere. Food was OK to very average. The extra orders of fries were exceptionally salty which the server acknowledged with a shrug of his shoulders. Cold food merited the same nonchalant response. A simple replacement would have been appreciated. Salmon season is now in Seattle but none on the menu.I don't know if my experience was different than others. Did they just have a bad night? Who knows. Overall I am not sure I would be back. There are many other places with the same price where the service and food are better. Went with a party and we didnt even order that much and by the time the bill came it was well over $150. None of us were full and the food was okay but that not amazing. We ordered some cheese with bread, fried rice balls, some sweet potato fries, 2 salads along with various drinks. I cant really recommend anything because I didnt love anything here... The place did look gorgeous though. Sazerac is within walking distance of many downtown hotels, so it's a good place to hang out if you're in from out of town and want a relaxing environment. My family and I came in here for pre-dinner drinks and snacks, and were directed to a very comfy couch past the bar. The staff was lovely, and I really enjoyed the Spire Cider they had. The boyfriend was also a fan of the Mac &amp; Jack's darker ale. I think the drinks (their drink menu is massive) and the staff was the best part of Sazerac. We were all unimpressed with the food, for the most part. We got the charcuterie sampler platter ($15) and I thought that the meat was equal to if not less than the quality of something I'd buy at the supermarket. Also, I wish they'd described their olive dish ($5) on the menu as being different from your general mediterranean olive in oil. They were dry and kind of sweet and almost looked like grapes. None of us had eaten olives like them before and nobody seemed to like them very much. At least there were a lot of them? I do have to say though that, while a little pricey, their kumamoto oysters were very fresh and tasty!So, overall, a very good place for drink on a cozy couch and a taste of some good oysters! The atmosphere was really cool so I had high hopes. The service wasn't very attentive and even when our server came around to our table, we weren't offered another drink despite my empty glass. The appetizer we ordered was good but small and overpriced--$7 for 3 very small dates stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in bacon. The entrees were presented nicely but were overcooked. The drinks lacked complexity and just tasted like straight up booze (around $12/drink). This place has potential but is definitely lacking in quality. There was nothing fundamentally wrong here... &#160; the prices for what you get is a little out of wack for the food. &#160; The wife had a few appys for a meal and the appys were quite small... so she was left a little hungry... &#160; I had the stuffed dates for an appy, and the burger which was good (shared out a lot of fries and quite a few bites of my burger to keep her happy) but again... not stellar (nothing really to complain about though). &#160;I had a drink (the special one of the day) which was ok... but not great.In the end when the bill showed up... we were over $100. &#160; The next night we went to the Brooklyn Seafood, Steak, and Oyster bar... and it was around $140... &#160;AND DEFINITELY worth that. &#160;So... for $40 more... &#160;just go to a better restaurant I guess. Sazerac is a decent option if you are trapped downtown for business, and their happy hour has generous hours. It is fairly spacious and there is a private dining room for special events. It is not, however, worth the trip unless you're looking for a place in the area.Few of the dishes really stand out. The dates were obscenely stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in bacon. The cheese and bacon really overpowered the dates, and not in a good way.Wifey and I also shared two other appetizers. The chicken liver "mousse" was mousse in no way, shape or form. I'm not really sure how to describe it, other than that it appeared to be a fried chunk of liver. The beer tartare was actually quite good and had a nice array of spices in it (although it was not spicy). It was probably the star of the dinner.As for entrees, there was a grilled mahi mahi special for Wifey and I got the small portion of the fried catfish. &#160;My small portion was probably just as big as her normal one, and neither was particularly impressive. The catfish was good, don't get me wrong, but the jalapeno-lime butter sauce sort of took over the dish after a while. The mahi mahi was relatively bland.They were out of the apple-rum-raisin crumble (dagger!!!) so we opted for the chocolate cake, which was more like a molten chocolate cake and was pretty good. Best happy hour in downtown seattle!HH menu: http://www.sazeracrestau&#8230;If you like brie cheese, i'd recommend: warm oozing st. andre which is baked brie cheese that comes with grilled bread. Two I liked are FLORENTINE (ricotta, spinach, roasted garlic and bechamel) and ANDOUILLE (sausage, onions and etc) wood-fired pizzas -- they are delicious! My fianc&#233;e and I had the four course dinner menu and overall it was pretty good. The grits were a bit cheesy and the portion was very large the scallops were a bit burned on one side however the dish overall worked pretty well. The beet salad was quite delicious. The beef tartare starter was a bit spicier than I thought and I didn't know why there was an egg on top of it since it didn't add whole lot to the flavor. It had a very light flavor but they could've maybe been seasoned it differently. The staff were very professional and I thought our waiter was very courteous. I wouldn't mind going back again to try the other items on the menu. I went to Sazerac a month or two ago for an aids benefit thingy. It was during happy hour, which, I must say, was fantastic. I had the Marguerite pizza and fries and my friend had the beef tartar and pork sliders. The tartar was great, for what it was (we didn't know that tartar is raw meat) and it tasted even better when we cooked the left overs for tacos. The fries were fries so nothing special there. The pork sliders were juicy and seasoned perfectly, the pizza was amazing!!!All in all, i would go again for happy hour :) Perfect service at all times of the day may be found at Sazerac. &#160;Amazing food. &#160;At lunch, be sure to ask for extra cornbread. &#160;It is like cake. &#160;Slather it with butter.The happy hour has great specials. &#160;This is a place to take a visitor when they come to see you in Seattle. I was in Seattle for a week for work and my boss recommended this place. &#160;I went with a co-worker for happy hour on a Wednesday. &#160;We were seated at the sou chef counter which was really cool because we got to watch them making all our food. &#160;We ordered the sweet potato fries, Caesar salad, Florentine pizza, pork sliders and garlic clams. &#160;My favorite were the pizza and clams. &#160;Service was really great, the food came out quick and hot. &#160;We both ate and had a cocktail for about $50 including tip. &#160;This will be one of my regular stops whenever I'm in Seattle. Sazerac is my go to suggestion when people are asking for a new restaurant in Seattle. &#160;It amazes me how few people have heard of it.Funky decor, friendly service, never seems to be as busy as surrounding restaurants (I'm looking at you Purple).Must trys are the truffle cheese potato ball things, bacon wrapped dates, and the catfish. &#160;I hate catfish. &#160;Theirs is delicious. Also, they've got a great happy hour and wine prices are pretty reasonable for Seattle. How have we not been here before?!? &#160;Great location to 5th Avenue Theatre (pre-show dinner).I love the open space and the natural light pours into this restaurant. &#160;We loved the dirty rice fritters, the crispy "truffles" (fried potato goodness), and the grits.The happy hour menu looks great... we will be back. Love the Happy Hour here! It's from 4-8pm Mon-Sat..how convenient. I hate how most happy hours end at 6pm when most people are just getting out of work. The food &amp; drinks are just fabulous. The wood-fired pizzas are delicious. So are the fries, pulled pork sandwiches, crispy truffles, and artichoke dip. My friends love their Manhattan. Their watermelon white sangria (housemade) is so refreshing! It's always busy here! I only got turned away once on a Friday night. Sazerac is fun. Working nearby, this is a usual pick for lunches with friends or colleagues or vendors, and the happy hour sucks a lot of us in with a frequency. In fact, the only reason they don't get the 5th star is that their food quality - lunch and dinner - seems to have slipped of late.Breakfasts here are odd - you get the standard stuff you'd expect for a restaurant attached to a hotel, but also an egg dish with red beans and andouille sausage or pain perdu smothered in bananas foster. Their wackier entrees are great, though, and there's always seating.Lunches are brisk and tasty. Rotisserie chicken related things are usually good (although the chicken has been on the dry side last few times I've had it, so I don't know what's going on there), sandwiches are tasty, and the apps are well done and great to share around the table. Dinners are good too, although there are occasional execution errors (cooking food to a requested degree of doneness seems to be the Achilles' heel). The reason to come, really, is happy hour. The HH list has a lot of good wine and food at fairly low prices, and the cocktails never fail to please. It's comforting to know that on those nights when you give up on producing any kind of real food to feed yourself, and especially on those nights when you've given up before leaving the downtown area, these guys have your back. I had to rack my brain a bit to recall this one, but I believe I dropped in here about a year ago with fellow Yelpers Becca L and Sara S for a happy hour, with what I recall being a somewhat extensive menu.We ended up sharing bacon-filled dates, sliders, sweet potato fries, and a pizza, along with a margarita for myself. While the sliders were tasty and the dates weren't bad, the pizza was just okay, and the sweet potato fries were pretty subpar. The margarita was pretty good though, and a fairly strong drink at that too.And, unfortunately, that's all I had in my notes. It probably isn't saying much that I can't really remember much more about this place (I usually remember minor details about any restaurant I've been to within the last few years, so...). At least the company was good - this, I remember still! Swung by here on a Sunday night - the place was basically empty. &#160;I had a decent old fashioned and my wife had the saskatoon which was interesing - rich and warm - sort of like a smokey Manhattan. Like I said, interesting, but I don't know if it's a repeater. &#160;We had the dirty croquettes (yummy), with a blah parsley aioli - the color was more interesting than the taste. &#160;We also had the crispy truffles. &#160;These potato balls were cooked perfectly and had a wonderful, rich truffle flavor. &#160;Service was attentive. &#160;It was good - I think it might be better on a night with a more full menu. The scene here is happenin' for sure! &#160;It was the middle of the week, 7pmish and was totally packed. &#160;I think this is one of those restaurants you will always need a reservation if you need a table. &#160;I sat at the bar and noshed on a caesar salad. &#160;The appetizers all sound delcious, but totally fried. &#160;I didn't go too crazy and ordered a vodka cran. &#160;The drink was really watered down, and despite sitting right at the bar, they were understaffed. (Either that, or I felt a bit ignored.) &#160;All &#160;in all, an alright experience. I checked out their HH on a Tuesday night around six. First of all, parking is terrible but we all know this is true downtown. Their HH is from 4-8pm and includes a pretty big menu but their wine by the glass menu was pretty blah. Cocktail menu looked pretty extensive, though, and Seattle DOES love its cocktail bars, doesn't it?? I had the Truffle Balls and a few oysters. They were serving Virginica and some other type that the bartender wasn't too sure about, accompanied by the normal shallot vinegar and a subpar cocktail sauce.... Buuut I adore horseradish so its probably more my fault than theirs. As for the truffle balls, I'm a sucker for truffles and they were pretty awesome. Yukon gold mashed potatoes surrounding a truffle cheese bit, then fried with love. With truffle aioli to boot!I love finding the elusive later running HH, so I very well may be back, but it wasn't a stand-out experience. Prawns are a delicious tapas treat. Catfish is fantastic --love, love, love it although a bit on the salty side. Somewhat pricy, precious lunch place, but good. &#160;They know how to cook catfish, I'll give them that. &#160;And my companion raved over the scallops: best ever, she said. &#160;I don't even like scallops but I tried a bite, and yep, it was good. Upscale New Orleans style appetizers and meals. &#160;Not the place for a good ol' oyster po'boy; but their carrot and parmesan grits are delicious. A great selection of drinks, including alcoholic coffee drinks, at the full bar. &#160;Not a place I might go to on a regular basis, but when out of town friends are in downtown, i might just go back to try the gumbo. Ok WOW! I love this place! I've been here twice now, once for drinks and the second time, technically room service at the Hotel Monaco.The bar has a really cool, hip vibe with an eclectic atmosphere. Which, with a name like Sazerac, I suppose that's to be expected! &#160;Sazerac means: cocktail made with rye or bourbon, bitters, Pernod, and sugar, stirred or shaken with ice, strained and served with a twist of lemon rind.For me, anything with bourbon automatically has my attention! But I digress.... My meal from room service was AMAZING!! If all hotels had Room Service like this, I'd ditch my mortgage in a second! (speaking as a Realtor, that's saying a lot!) I ordered a cup of the "Rooster, Shrimp &amp; Andouille Gumbo" with the "Cider Chile Glazed St. Louis Style Ribs" which came with cheddar baked grits. &#160;A shot of Makers Mark 46 to wash it all down and you end up with about as perfect a meal as you could want! The Gumbo had just the right amount of kick with perfectly cooked meats and fantastic texture. The ribs....OMG THE RIBS!!! Fall off the bone tender ribs with an amazing chili glaze. &#160;Had I been eating these in the bar and not the privacy of my room, I probably wouldn't have taken the grits and swished em' around in the extra glaze... But I wasn't in the bar and boy was that a nice combo!!! I can certainly mark gluttony off the list of 7 deadly sins after this meal.AND being a Makers Mark ambassador, it was sure nice to find someplace that served 46. And having it all whisked to your room faster than Dominos? Sublime! This was my first meal at Sazerac in years, and I was very pleased with just about everything. &#160;My wife and I are vegetarians, and there was a decent amount for us to choose from on the menu. &#160;My wife had told me that their cheese plate was the best in town, and I believe she may be correct. &#160;The 3 cheeses were served with wonderful grilled bread, crisp sliced pear, and a wonderful fruit compote that contained berries. &#160;The other notable dish were the grits with roasted carrots and spring vegetables. &#160;It was a very unusual but wonderfully tasty concoction. &#160;The service was very good, the waitress was delightful, and the room was casual, warm and very tastefully decorated. Finally, it was very reasonably priced for the quality and amount of food served. &#160;We can't wait to go back. Could we have a better happy hour (with a teenager) than at ivar's? &#160;Yes!!! &#160;Sazerac, which is attached to Hotel Monaco, is cool, busy, and delicious, plus their happy hour is from 4-8pm, and they gave us a table for three (a teen). &#160;She was the only one there, but no problem. &#160;The well Gin and Tonic was just fine, as was the draft local. &#160;The highlights were the plates, all way bigger than you would normally get at happy hour: &#160;a Caesar with a whole, home-cured anchovy &#160;a bubbling iron skillet of mushrooms &#160;a beautiful composed dish of at least 8 cured anchovies over thinly sliced cucumbers and a salsa-like chou chou &#160; tasty thin cut fries in a tall milkshake container (not crispy though) with three dipping sauces &#160; personal, thin-thin pizzas &#160; a giant artichoke spread with foccacia (almost like a mac and cheese, without the mack) &#160; &#160;a goat cheese-stuffed, and bacon wrapped date (my favorite)Only regret is that we didn't come here the first night in town! &#160;Service was efficient and friendly. 5 stars!! the service, the food, the bartenders, the cocktails. Everything was outstanding! We started out stay at the Hotel Monaco by having drinks and apps at the bar. They made me a personalized pizza that had no garlic and lots of mushrooms, the meat on it was so juicy. We loved every bite. We had the sazerac of course and a dirty martini - both was so tasty. The next visit we had breakfast I had the diablo scramble and ryan had the egg whites with tomatos. Really tasty. The only downfall was the price of the bloody mary bar, for the amount of vodka and for the options I think they could make it cheaper. Good place for a quick business lunch, great happy hour. &#160;Good vibe overall. Went here for a happy hour after work on a weekday. I like the ambiance of the place, and it was a pleasant experience. It was pretty busy, but we ended up getting a table (for about 12 people). The staff was good, and food was reasonable. Drinks got a little expensive, but that's pretty much how the area goes. It was a good place to stop in and sit down with co-workers. I'm used to having superb meals at the restaurants next to Kimpton Hotels. During a recent stay at Hotel Monaco in dowtown Seattle I had a few meals at Sazerac and was somewhat disappointed. The menu is cleverly written but lacking...especially for breakfast. If you hapen to get two different chefs you will get different looking meals. We got the Eggs in Hell on two different days and had two different dishes. It was strange. There really is no kid freindly breakfast. You'd better want a sandwicj for lunch because that is really all they offer. There really isn't anything I'd reccommend other than the decor and atmosphere.
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The food here is fantastic -- and yes, there is more to Vietnamese food than pho! &#160;I love the vermicelli dishes, especially the one with charbroiled chicken -- definitely rivals the awesome Vietnamese food found back in my home base. &#160;The Vietnamese style iced coffee is good too -- not too sweet and wonderfully strong.Now what I really love about this place is the folks here are SO UNBELIEVABLY NICE and make you feel so comfortable. &#160;It is such a treat to come here...I feel like part of the family! &#160;In fact, they call me "Sister" here. &#160;I love it! &#160;Do they know my name? &#160;No, of course not silly bean! &#160;But that's ok. &#160;I know my name. &#160;I've heard it lots of times before. &#160;And quite frankly, when I'm hungry, I can be called ButtFacedGimp for all I care.Thanh VI is such a contrast to the other pho places on the Ave. that are pretty impersonal. &#160;Granted I have never had the pho here. &#160;But like I said, there is more to Vietnamese food than pho, just as there is more to Gilligan's Island than the Skipper and Mary Ann.Oh, and the Banh Mi (sandwiches) are the best on the Ave. &#160;You can actually sit down and they will serve it to you on a PLATE and CUT IN HALF! &#160;OHMYGOODNESS imagine that. &#160;Yes, Sister, that's right.
When your friend says, "Have I got a place for you..." and then he follows it up with, "thier specialty is toast", you have to wonder if your friend has spent too much time drinking his dinners or he's a little short on the carbs. &#160;That being said, we tried it anyhow.The food was great, the service comfortable and the ambience very well put together. &#160;I will tell you to try out this unique place for a warm and well displayed meal... plenty of food and the toast was quite good too. We went last night to the Sunday Supper. The menu theme was Tuscany.We started off with an antipasto plate consisting of salami, marinated mushrooms and onions, some sort of tapenade, and toast with chicken pate (I think it was chicken)2nd course was a salad which I enjoyed, and I'm not a salad person.Main course was braised sausages with white beans. Dang that was good! I kept dipping my bread into the broth that the sausages were cooked in til the serving dish was dry!God I love coming here. It's nice to have pre-set menu where you have no control over what you get. I find this to be a great way to step out of my culinary comfort zone and try things I would probably balk at if I saw it on a menu.Thank you Dinette, for a wonderful Sunday evening. Ok, I like Dinette, but for HAPPY HOUR ONLY. &#160;We went for dinner and we were very disappointed, mostly in our server. &#160;Her first greeting at our table was, "I have to take away your specials menu because we are out of it." &#160;Um, Hello. &#160;How are you? &#160;She was not very friendly and almost seemed bothered by us. &#160;We had a couple of the "toasts" which were great. &#160;Then we were going to order a large order of the risotto to share, but we asked her if we should order 2 of the smaller orders so we could try both the meat and vegetarian. &#160;Mistake! &#160;My husband had the meat risotto and I had the vegetarian. &#160;Poor guy's risotto did not even fill the bottom of his bowl. &#160;We asked our server about it and her response was, "Well everything is pre-packaged in these baggies and pre-weighed." &#160;Um, really, that's the response when we ask why the $18 risotto doesn't fill even the bottom of his bowl? &#160;How about, "Let me see what I can do." and get a little more risotto from the kitchen?! &#160;I mean, come on. &#160;It was annoying and we couldn't believe it. &#160; The dinner is too pricey for what you get, and while it is good food, you can get just as good items from their happy hour menu. &#160;JUST DO HAPPY HOUR AT DINETTE. My first Capitol Hill restaurant experience. See below for my observations:1. I like the ambiance. Cozy, warm, rustic and hip. I observed that this restaurant looks like it's catered for "lovers" ha! People are dressed up so sharp in here - is it because it's Valentine's? Not sure.2. One of the best rib eye steak that I've tried. I'm kind a picky with my steak so this is really good. One of the best. Parsnip cake is awesome. The fig and anchovy spread is also good. Their chef did a good job.3. Waiter is attentive and friendly. Big plus.4. Why 4 stars? Everything is just great but I think this place is expensive. It's good when you come here when you like to impress your gf or wife etc. or maybe come here for Birthday, Valentines or Anniversary. I can't imagine coming here anytime I want to.I'm going back again maybe next year ha! Dinette has been our favorite neighborhood (Cap Hill) &#160;eatery for the past three years. Yes, Spinasse, Quinns, Smith, OddFellows Cafe, Volunteer Park Cafe and so many others are good, but something about Dinette just feels right. It is not as loud as the others, nor as expensive. The portions are just right, and the menu has a nice balance of dishes. The ricotta gnocchi is our favorite in town.The service has been friendly, efficient, and professional. None of this "keep your silverware for the next course" attitude so prevalent in Seattle. We have our favorite waitperson, who is wonderful, but we aren't revealing a name as we &#160;don't want competition. Our only gripe is that when we have taken other people, it has fallen a bit flat, usually when a special is ordered. On the other hand, the stuffed cabbage rolls turned me onto stuffed cabbage rolls. The decor is simple enough that the designer in me is happy. But it is simple enough that I know that the place is not burdened with unnecessary decor debt, and that it is not trying to impress me with grandiose decor (Cascadia). You will not see many 5 stars from me, but because this place has been able to make me so happy over the years, I do give it five. For everyday (er, night) eating, Dinette is tops. I wouldn't call the food "fusion", but they do play around a bit with conventional dishes. What Dinette absolutely *excels* at is their sunday suppers, family-style placesettings on two long tables. Whenever they're in the mood for it (unsure about the frequency) they will get confirmations for interest in a certain region's cuisine, and once they have enough reservations plan a menu for all. The food is authentic, delicious, just delightful.The food prices are fair for the quality of the chef, the wine prices are also fair, the crostinis are hit or miss depending on what's in season. Really tasty homey food.Came here on a Thursday evening with some guests out of town. Everything we ordered was delicious and unpretentious. I got a smoked pork chop with brussels and canneli beans. Mmm.. so good! The bread pudding was also frickin' amazing! It was amazingly light! Environment and food made me feel super comfy. I'd love to bring more out of town guests here. It was a bit pricy for an everyday restaurant. We had a $50 gift certificate from the stranger mart, but even so the bill was pretty hefty between the four of us.We lucked out with street parking, but I could see finding parking might be difficult here at times. The toasts and soups are superb. Delightful, unpretentious food at a fair price. Every dish our table had was spot on. The smoked pork chop was perhaps the most delicious piece of pig I've had in a long time. it had a subtle, sensuous smokiness paired with a tender, juiciness that goes all the way. Oh yeah!Also, the flatware was cute and mismatched silver. Love it! Dinette is that cute little restaurant you'd never think to drop in unless recommended by a friend, but I'm glad I did. The d&#233;cor, ambiance, and servers were all warm, friendly, and inviting. This is a perfect place to break open a glass of wine and just relax for an evening of good food and conversation.Between my friend and I we ordered: salame toscano toast, tapas plate, Penn Cove mussels, and the pork and duck rilletes to start. I had the tagliatelle and she had the Idaho trout.If I were to return, I would try more of their toasts. I scoffed when reading toasts on the menu, but the salame toscano was absolutely delicious. Salty salame and creamy fontina, topped with roasted garlic and a roasted red pepper, which was the star of the dish and helped bring everything together.The tapas plate and mussels were yummy but nothing worth writing home about. The rilletes? Interesting. I don't know if the taste and texture is for me, but it was good.The tagliatelli was cooked well but lacked a certain oomph. Maybe a bit more salt or a salty element thrown in there to give it some liveliness. Overall the dish was a bit muted with the lentil and mushroom ragu, which was tasty on its own.The prices are very reasonable and I would definitely make an effort to head out there to eat at Dinette again. Maybe next time I'll scale back on the amount of food, but it was all so delicious. It's always a sad thing when you go for a three (or four) course meal and everything but the main course is outstanding. Such was the case at Dinette this Saturday. The salmon toast was amazing: simple and unique. The pate appetizer was classic French yummyness. The chocolate terrine for desert was very impressive. But the main courses.... were just ok. I had the trout and my fiance had the trofie with clam sauce. They were both good, but honestly I could have made them pretty efficiently in my own kitchen.The main courses were disappointing as a whole because of the lack of variety. Of the five dishes, one was fish and the rest were pasta. There had been a duck special but they had ran out of it. I would expect there to be something else on the menu other than pasta, considering this is mostly 'rustic' fare.But the ambiance was great. It was awesome watching the smartly dressed hipsters, leather clad gay couple and neatly done up tranny walk on by. It was pretty fun people watching. In the end, we decided it would be a spectacular place for happy hour ( toast! toast! toast!) though I don't know that we'll come back for dinner anytime soon. Especially on the hill right now, there are just too many other places to try. I love this happy hour, especially that they do it on Friday and Saturday nights! &#160;Delicious toasts, soup, wine and pate. &#160;I only wish there were more seats. &#160;Sometimes it is very hard to get a chair. &#160;Dinner is also worth paying (non happy hour) full prices. &#160;Service is friendly and attentive. My friends and I were wandering around Capitol Hill last weekend around 11 pm searching for a decent karaoke bar, and stumbled upon Dinette. &#160;Right at the entrance is a cozy victorian-style bar with an amaaaazing bartender who can not only serve some one-of-a-kind cocktails, but also a mean cup of french-pressed coffee for the designated driver. &#160;The kitchen had closed, so we weren't able to eat, but my girlfriend's drink (something with lemon and rosemary in it) was amazing. &#160;The atmosphere was nothing like what we had been looking for that night, but we felt at home at the cozy bar and stayed until they closed. &#160;Definitely going back a little earlier to try the food. &#160;Great place to take your girlfriends to. &#160;Wonderful bartender who knows a lot about the city, whiskey, and scotch if you want to bring your boyfriend too. I really love you Dinette. Who would've know you'd take the old shell of the vegetarian Green Cat and make it into something as wonderful and special without the foodie pretense. As winter comes soon, I will keep warm thoughts of your cassoulet with duck confit and your meatballs on polenta, and of course chicken liver toast!
Good standard breakfast food. &#160;Nice fun environment, very friendly staff, fast, not expensive. You wake up at 9:00 on a weekend to the sound of your stomach screaming at you to WAKE UP ALREADY AND EAT SOME FOOD. So, you open the pantry. No way you're having soggy freezer waffles or cold cereal today. You need an actual meal. I think you know where to go.Luna Park Cafe has a pleasantly quirky atmosphere and an old fashioned presentation. The staff is witty and fun and are always on the ball when it comes to seating you. Though some may find it a bit tacky, I love their 50s decor, mostly because I know that most of it is really from the 50s. Tons of Items from the actual Amusement Park flood the restaurant. Remember to bring lots of quarters --especially if you have kids-- for the little machines, the jukebox, and the unforgettable bat mobile ride! The food is classic diner cuisine, but not boring at all. I love their hash browns, and you CAN'T leave Luna Park Cafe without having one of their rightfully famous milkshakes (Keep in mind that they're very filling, so don't be getting three large milkshakes all for yourself)! I recommend the Mickey Mouse pancakes and the chicken strips for kids, and the burgers for everybody. &#160;All their food is great, and reasonably priced!I love Luna Park Caf&#233;, and I know you will, too! Give it a try! this diner has a super friendly wait staff. the food is a-ok for the price. the eggs are HUGE and it reminds me alot of eagle rock part of los angeles. amongst the flurry of post veg pre vegan nut and oats eater style restaurants located in the seattle area, &#160;this place will always hold its own. This is one of the few places where you'll hear me say that the wait is worthwhile. &#160;On busy days it takes a little while to get a table, and it can be a bit crowded and loud at times, but for some reason I don't mind it here (I mind it very much most other places). &#160;The food is always a good value (not great, but good for the price), and the coffee is refilled consistently. &#160;That's all I really need to keep coming back for more.Oh, and the menu has some excellent variety as well. I've visited Luna over 4 times in the last month and I've been hooked on The Works. The flame-brolied flavor along with the juiciness of the burgers is amazing. And the thick fries are great! &#160;Oh, and the milkshakes are to die for!!!!!I love the look and decor, along with the pin-up-like ladies working the joint. The food has always been awesome, but the service on the patio has been a bit in the slow side on occasions. Its the best burger in West Seattle! A Seattle Gem! I love the laid back, vintage Seattle scene at this location. The waitresses have that rocker ,pin up look and the inside is very vintage.I ordered the Fairburger...flamebroiled awesomeness. The ranch sauce..A+ and there fries are thick. &#160;psss...the parking lot is tiny. We really love this place. We first started going for breakfast during the week and have been once for dinner now. The service is always great and prompt. The food is delicious! We have many favorites. The mint shake with chocolate chips is possibly my favorite milkshake. The atmosphere is really fun. The table-side jukebox is an awesome touch.Parking can be a bit tricky close-by, but I've never had any problem finding a spot within walking distance. I've driven by this place dozens of times on the way into West Seattle for Thai food or a drink or whatever else people do in there. Initially attracted by the Coney-Island-looking sign and drawn in further by their claims of having the best mlikshakes in Seattle, I put it on my mental list of places to try. The time finally came on Sunday afternoon...After a long day of looking at rental houses in neighborhoods I'd never even heard of under the imposing shadows of the Blue Angels, I was hungry and a little desperate for a chill place to sit and eat. We drove around for 20 minutes as I ran through the usual suspects on my phone to see if any place was open on Sunday. Only Luna Park and a pho place were nearby and I figured I might as well cross LP off the list. We walked in and were seated on the patio (our preference) as it was a decent sunny afternoon, around 3pm. We got waters and menus and then.... waited. And waited. Someone finally came by to take our order 15 or 20 minutes after we sat down, which was fine because we were talking and didn't notice too much. I ordered a milkshake and a sandwich and my date got a few of the appetizers on the happy hour menu. Another 15 or 20 minutes went by and I finally saw my milkshake. Small but not really, minty and delicious. I enjoyed it for another 15 or 20 minutes and we finally saw our food, having been assured just once in the span of almost an hour that our food would be out soon, but that there was only one cook so things were a little slow (to be fair, it was packed). Our food was good. Typical diner food, but everything tasted a little fresher. The fries were hot, and the happy hour plates were each big enough to stand alone as a small meal - five or six chicken strips with dipping sauce on one, and a bowl of hummus with plenty of pita and veggies on the other (and they were only three or four bucks each!). We waited a little longer for our bill and then again for it to be returned - all told, the lunch process took almost 90 minutes. A long time by most standards, but on a sunny Sunday afternoon, not the end of the world. The waitstaff were nice and also all unnaturally cool looking. The other diners seemed like a decent mix of people. The parking lot next to the building was full when we pulled up, but a good size and nice for this part of town (which seems to be primarily street parking). Very close to the West Seattle bridge, so it's not far from downtown. The bathroom was clean and the decor was cheesy but not terrible. There are a confusing amount of "Please wait to be seated!" signs with no actual hostess podium to wait at, so we kind of wandered around for the first few minutes.I'd go back if I really wanted a burger and milkshake and I was in the area. I've heard the breakfasts are good, and saw a few plates come out that looked eggy and appetizing. Still, I'd prefer Coney Island to Luna Park. Lunch and dinners here are consistently subpar. The burgers and french fries taste about the same as those from Burger King, and for more money.Breakfasts and milk shakes at Luna Park, however, are pretty darn good. I definitely recommend coming in before 10 for breakfast, as the french toast is some of the best I've had in a restaurant.The wait staff is friendly (or a little too friendly, in the case of one waitress whose breasts spill out of her top) when they actually pay attention to you. The last time I was there, it took a good 20 or 30 minutes to have a check brought out.Unless I'm awake early enough to breakfast, I don't plan on going back. Our walk with the Emerald City Wanderers Volkssport Club took us by here so we decided to have lunch after we finished walking.They have a small lot but there is tons of street parking (free for 2? hours).We were seated immediately and took in the place.. there is just stuff EVERYwhere. They have several machines for quarters (Batman ride for the kids, button/magnet machine, sticker/tattoo machine, etc). The servers were a very eclectic bunch but very nice and genuine.The food was typical diner stuff, but not greasy spoon. They had a whole page of breakfast fare and the other side was lunch (sandwiches/burgers). And of course, their milkshakes!I ordered their waffle combo (1 waffle, 1 egg, 2 sausage or bacon), but I really wanted the pancake or French toast combo, however they stop serving pancakes/French toast after 12p..probably to make room on the griddle. Anyway, the combo was ~$10 and the milk shakes were ~$5 for the regular size (a cup and then the leftover in the metal container). Food was good, just the right amount. The milk shakes were really 'the best' and I couldn't finish it.Anyhow, the place is pretty cool...I don't know all the history of it, but their website has the info. We also got free stickers when we paid. Score! Look for the crowds once you drive over the West Seattle Bridge and you know you've found the right place. :) Luna Park Caf&#233; is located close to where a carnival and boardwalk once proudly stood. And in homage to this turn-of-the-century amusement park, Luna Park Caf&#233; is a...... 1950's themed diner? It's best not to think about the connection too hard, in the same way that it's best not to critique the anachronism of finding 1980's era Stray Cats songs in the jukebox.If you can get past that, the atmosphere has some entertainment value. They have a number of old advertisements, posters, giant guitars, etc. lined along the wall. Again, taken in total, it's overwhelming kitsch. But it is fun to point out to kids some of the finer points of old advertisements festooning the walls next to your booth. ("See kids! That's what cigarette ads look like! Smoking really is cool!") As an added bonus, there is some nice outdoor seating for nicer weather.As for the food, it's pretty much basic diner fare. It is nice to see that breakfast is served all day and the milkshakes look interesting. But while I was killing an hour between meetings, it was already mid-afternoon and so I figured I'd try a burger. I had the Western burger which comes with fries, saut&#233;ed onions, bacon, and barbeque sauce. Also note that the burger comes with side lettuce, onion, pickles and tomatoes. Since in essence this burger comes with a double down on the onions, I can't recommend it if you're on a date. Unless it's the Kate Hudson "How to lose a guy in 10 days" kind of date, in which case bon app&#233;tit! So overall it's basic diner food with some novelty appeal, although the milkshakes look appealing (and may be worthy of an update at some point). Service was a bit slow although within reasonable limits and there is a small side lot for parking. It was full when I arrived, but there's a fair amount of street parking within a short distance. Luna Park Cafe in a nutshell: good but not life-changing. Decent enough. My sister was told Luna cafe gets great reviews, so what better way to test the rumors than with a midweek brunch? Tuesday morning we were seated and served promptly. The inside of Luna is decorated somewhat antique, somewhat random, and a few weird tidbits. I can't put my finger on what exactly they are going for, but they call themselves "a family place". Whatever you say, Luna. We both went with the "eggchiladas" which is just a really cute name for egg burritos. They were, again, decent but not outstanding. You can make them at home really easily (and in fact, I do often). The hashbrows were okay, and my sister's "fiesta" style eggchilada added a lot of oomph with the green chilies, onions &amp; tomatoes (for $1 more). Also, you pay for the side of sour cream that should come with it for free (I mean really now). With all that complaining, I will say that sister &amp; I could easily have shared the plate and walked away full. All in all, it was a relatively inexpensive and decent meal. 3 stars. I am a huge fan of their "pile" =) I love their food. My mom loves their Luna eggs. &#160;Service could totally be hit and miss. It's perfect on a Saturday morning or Sunday to sit outside and chat and have a delish breakfast. I never had to wait for more than 15 minutes but I usually get there before 10:30am. Most times before 10am if I don't want to wait at all. I've never tried anything but breakfast here so I'm not sure about the other foods that they have. I have to say I came here grudgingly. I don't often eat breakfast at 11, like ever. &#160;I &#160;really don't want to after nine am because it feels...wrong. Somehow. But of course their breakfasts are just right and at 10:20am ( prime lunch time for me is 10 am -12:30pm) &#160;it was the only side of the menu I could order from. &#160;So squelching my less than desirable personality traits I ordered a hobo. And it was delicious. The spinach in it was SO clean. *heart* &#160;Ah. &#160;I highly recommend the hobo option. *reads back* Ah- I recommended it before. Well its still good, and they have very nice iced tea. Luna has it's own unique atmosphere; the walls are covered in an array of carnival equipment and 50's kitsch and it's the perfect compliment the colorful wait staff who attend to your every need with wit and humor.When I lived in West Seattle, I took all my visiting out of town friends here for Sunday brunch; a.k.a. Hangover recovery. &#160;I recommend the Earth Pile or the Biscuits and Gravy, both will stick with you and get your through the rest of the day. &#160;I haven't been for happy hour but have heard good things, and the Milkshakes are just as good as advertised. The atmosphere is definitely fun. &#160;But you can tell that the establishment is going on their atmosphere and tradition, rather than focusing on the food. &#160;We had just landed in town to visit friends and were starving!! &#160;It was 11:30 and I wanted a burger so bad (if you read my other reviews you will see I am a burger enthusiast!), but they serve only breakfast till noon. &#160;That kinda bummed me out. &#160;But, go with the flow I say, so I tried a pile. &#160;It was ok. &#160;The edges were good, but the inside was not done. &#160;The ingredients were really fresh, so it had the potential to be a really great dish.The service was good, the food came out fast, the staff was friendly. &#160;The price was a bit high... 3 adult and 1 child breakfast was $50 before tip. &#160;I probably would eat there again just for the atmosphere, but I would like to try something else. Amazing milkshakes and a cute atmosphere! The food is above average for a diner. Go for the happy hour deals, or late night for breakfast or milkshakes.My mushroom and swiss burger was just okay, but definitely made from a frozen patty (not, say TGIFriday's calibre burgerness). The fries were meh. The hot chocolate came out looking very decadently delicious, but the fancy whipped cream and chocolate syrup was just covering up your usual swiss miss mixed with milk. The nachos were pretty good, and a pretty good deal during happy hour.I heard this place was retro, but it was not the classy retro styling I had imagined, more kitchy, but probably a good late night hangout for greasy breakfast foods and milkshakes. I have to admit, I did not try the milkshakes, advertized in the window as "best milkshakes in seattle," so that's what I might (remotely) go back for, or for the happy hour deal for a bucket of corona.Parking: there's a small lot! Unheard of, and useful. This place is pretty darn good. &#160;The waitress was fab, the food was good, and on a sunny morning, eating breakfast out in their patio was just awesome. Typical and traditional diner food. &#160;Cute theme with the oldies decor. &#160;Parking can be a pain during peak hours. &#160;Milkshakes are good (made w/real ice cream). &#160;Sometimes inconsistent when there's a different person making them every time. &#160;I guess they don't really have a formula down. They have this Elvis Presley sandwhich o' death that to be honest kinda freaked me out when I read the ingredients so I went ahead and settled for a traditional breakfast which was well prepared. I grabbed lunch here as well and it was pretty good. In general it's just a good place. They have quite a bit of outdoor seating and very little decent parking. Cute interior, with the kitsch and all. The milkshake exceeded expectations -- We asked for the small and it came out in not one, but two frosty tall milkshake glasses. When asked for clarification, the waitress said, "Yep, that's the small, we pour the extra into another glass for you." Nice, real nice.And even though they were packed, our food came out fast.However -- and this is a big however -- when the food came to the table and my partner lifted up her burger, there was a long greasy hair stuck to the plate. When we told the waitress about it, she was like, "Oh, ok. I'll let the kitchen know." and she WALKED AWAY. WTF!? No offer to get a new plate, a fresh meal, a discount, nada.Weaksauce, Luna Park. Not too sure why I like this place so much. Perhaps, because it's the last building of its type from the Luna Amusement Park era, circa 1910. You know, the one that was finally torched because its owner was heavily into prostitution &amp; orgies with his WA state politician buddies and their ladies of the night; that someones wife, or other pious, prude, noble citizen(s) decided it was time to put an end to all the debauchery. "The Seattle Post-Intelligencer added fuel to their ire. A January 31, 1911 newspaper article contained accusations that at 'Sunday night dances at Luna Park ... girls hardly 14 years old, mere children in appearance, mingled with the older, more dissipated patrons and sat in the dark corners drinking beer, smoking cigarettes and singing.'"Yeah, we have a place like that now too; it's called Capitol Hill.History of the surrounding area I think is what makes this place so intriguing. Burgers, fries, shakes -everything is pretty damn tasty. Staff are a bit strange; young and attractive, but odd. Like they're all from a different time long ago.If you go after closing hours, take a seat outside then peer into the vast darkness, While there, try to imagine images of ghosts in pre WWI attire strolling the pier, their heavy shoes clapping the worm infested planks amidst faint sounds of pipe organs and Ferris wheels, laughing women, and the scents of cheap perfume, decaying saltwater taffy, popcorn and hot dogs.Holy crap. It's haunted.
This restaurant is such a breath of fresh air! &#160;Beautiful view with linen covered tables. &#160;Our waitress was very attentive without being too overbearing. &#160;All the food we had was unbelievable... until the last course... &#160;All of our dishes came cold! &#160;We should have sent them all back but it was my brother's birthday and we were on to the next spot. &#160;I would come back again and give it 5 stars for properly heated food! Quiet little place just off crowded Pike Place Market with a view of the water. Great ambiance and menu. I was just a bit disappointed that our Dungeness crab was served cold. Not as good as it has been in the past, but still worth 4 stars.Quality dishes, though it seems like it used to be more French Bistro. &#160;Now, more eclectic and middle of the road on originality.Beautiful view of Puget Sound, very friendly waitstaff.I have taken friends from out of town, and my Mother-in-law. &#160;All my guests rave!Solid intimate dining experience always. Unbelievable. One of the most magical lunches of my life, from the staff to the tasteful French decor to the way they filed the bread basket, to the mussels, which were stunning. Really, I am still thinking about the mussels &#160;- they were out of this world! An excellent start to our vacation in Seattle. When I suggested we grab lunch in Pike's Place Market, what I had in mind was just grazing at the stalls, not sitting down at a restaurant. But the market was really crowded that day, so I'm really glad Vince spotted this place behind the fish market and suggested we go here instead. It was really the only truly spontaneous meal of the trip, as we knew absolutely nothing about the place before deciding to try it. We don't normally drink cocktails, but it was vacation, so we decided to indulge. We got a champagne cocktail, a bellini, and a corpse reviver, all expertly made with fresh ingredients. Next up was a plate of sister's point oysters with a nice white burgandy, which we enjoyed outside with a view of the ocean and a nice breeze (on a fortuitously sunny day in Seattle). Next up was a lyonnaise salad and escargot, which we all shared, followed up with crab cakes and a "stratta," which is a sort of savory bread pudding. Still hungry, we got some more oysters and some more wine before finishing up with some espresso. It was an excellently decadent lunch to set the tone for our trip. Between the menu and the wine list, we'd certainly consider trying dinner, and we'd definitely come back for lunch. Yum. &#160;I cannot get over the mussels and the French onion soup. &#160;Their Washington wine selections are great (how amazing is it that we live on this productive west coast), and today, we had a lovely Viognier-Rousanne blend. &#160; As I've said before, the understated French-Pacific-Northwest cuisine (simple, yet bursting with flavor) coupled with the view? &#160;Unbeatable. &#160;I love Seattle. We went here for lunch after seeing the onion soup in Seattle Magazine. The view from our table was great. The waitstaff were very nice and helpful. The soup was tasty, very cheesy. I got the bowl. I think next time I will opt for a cup and a salad as all that cheese was a little heavy for me. I filled out one of those cards you get with your bill and 4 days later I had a nice note-card in the mail from them thanking me for coming in with a business card for a free appetizer next time I come in. If that isn't good service, I don't know what is. I can't wait to go back! Full disclosure: My friend's husband is the sous Chef here. Thankfully he's really talented, because otherwise I would have to withhold my review and lie to my friend - two things that I hate doing. Now, on to dinner!Actually, before I get to dinner, can I just say that it was my first time here and wow....the VIEW! I know it's been said before but, really, breathtaking. Sitting by the open window at dusk, watching the ferries make their nightly runs as the sun sets and the city is illuminated - it was one of those moments you know you'll remember fondly and always look to recreate. It was easy to fall in love with this place. And, if you're a history nerd like me, you'll like it even more after looking into its seedy history as the Lotus Inn.Ok, NOW to dinner. We started out with the mussels ( I know, how original) but the yelpers have spoken and we had to try them. As expected, they were amazing. The broth had Bacon, shallots, and some balsamic, and my only complaint is that I ate too much bread sopping it all up after the mussels were gone. Our main course was so original - we were trying to come up with a way to describe it and decided on "Choose your own adventure." I think it was fitting. Here's what was on our plate: Seared petite filet of Washington beef, fregola and sultana risotto, lump crab oscar with sauce charon, piquillo coulis and pine nut and local arugula pesto. And somehow it worked. I recommend eating section-by-section to really appreciate each individual food. For dessert we had some sort of bread puddingy berry concoction with a ricotta/chevre blend on top. I was too full from the meal to really enjoy it so I took most of it home and my husband wolfed it down. He gives it four stars.After dinner we sat and had some wine and listened to some Ella and appreciated the cool breeze off the water. A perfect Seattle evening. Charming little restaurant at Pike Place ... definitely a great romantic atmosphere for couples. &#160;The wait staff is friendly and the bar has its regulars (many of the patrons were on a first name basis with the staff). &#160;As for the food, you MUST try their french onion soup. &#160;By far and away the best french onion soup I've ever had. &#160;Place Pigalle is definitely a restaurant I will be going to every time I visit Seattle. First off the mussel bisque was quite simply the best bisque I've ever had in my life. The view of Puget Sound was lovely at sunset and the menu was pleasant without being extremely overpriced. Our waiter was awesome, the fresh oysters were great and but for the moment when the we were accidentally charged for the wine from the table next to ours the experience was perfect. Of course of bill was promptly adjusted and I would suggest Place Pigalle to all who venture to Seattle and like sea food. You must, MUST try their mussels! &#160;It was so delicious and different from mussels I've had elsewhere. &#160;it's cooked in creamy balsamic sauce with bits of bacon. &#160;The sauce was to die for and I licked the bowl clean. &#160;Mussels were cooked perfectly and I loved how the bacon pieces added some texture and flavor but did not over power the dish.I also got their bouillabaisse. &#160;It was ok. &#160;The sauce could have been hotter and it was slightly on the bland side. &#160;Seafood in it was cooked perfectly though.The view of Puget sound was gorgeous, great service and a great meal. &#160;Can't wait to come back and have some more of those mussels. My Qu&#233;b&#233;coise girlfriend and I wanted to celebrate our anniversary with some simple French food. Place Pigalle exceeded our expectations. Our waiter was engaging and thoughtful. Every choice on the prix fixe menu was delicious and authentic, and the atmosphere was perfect for a romantic conversation. I wish more people knew about this place because it is absolutely fantastic! Very friendly employees. Welcoming and willing to recommend great dishes. The drinks were amazing and the creme brulee was among the best I have had.Even spending what I did on the vintage port was well worth it. With baby on the way hubby and I decided we need to make more of an effort to do things we had been planning to do but putting off. &#160;Trying out Seattle's many lovely restaurants was definitely at the top of our list. &#160;We asked around for recommendations and this place came up on top for many.I've been to Pike's Place many many times and never knew this place existed. &#160;It's a quaint/cozy space tucked away in a corner behind a fish stall. &#160;Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable. &#160;This place seemed family-run and everyone seemed very helpful and pleasant. &#160;We got a table for two by the window (romantic!) and hubby was excited to order Absinthe from the bar and drink it the authentic French way (with ice water and sugar cube). &#160;I stuck to water. &#160;They are the only restaurant I've been to that uses filtered water instead of just tap.For appetizers, we ordered the special of the day, duck confit, and mussels, on recommendation from friends. &#160;The duck was amazing...the meat was succulent and the skin was so crisp! &#160;I was a little surprised by the mussels. &#160;I think I was expecting your typical mussels cooked in a soupy broth but these mussels were loaded with bacon bits, little bits of celery, and a creamy vinaigrette-y sauce... they were delish!For dinner, I ordered the sea scallops and hubby ordered the prawns. &#160;The sea scallops were huge...tender, moist, just the right amount of chewy, served with a light and refreshing salad. &#160;The prawns were served with a peach salsa and jasmine rice. &#160;Hubby loved the prawns. &#160;They were grilled to perfection but he did not like the rice. &#160;I'm not sure what it was seasoned with but it was served cold and I think that's what threw him off. &#160;Still, we both savored every bite of our dinner.Would we go back? &#160;Heck yes. &#160;It might be a while though since we only have three months to try out a huge long list of Seattle's best restaurants. &#160;;) I still wanted another glass of that good ol' Washington State vino...Pinot, I thought. I wandered out of the Mayflower {..."good evening Miss Kelly..." said the doorman} and towards Pike Place Mkt. Well, as Place Pigalle is the most famous red light district in all of Paris and I am a solo lady dressed all in black (Seattle Style, of course), it behooves me to... it is almost mandatory that I stop in for (ahem) a big, fat, juicy, GLASS OF WINE, thank you.The bartender let me try almost anything that I wanted until I found something that I really really wanted. After all that tasting, I actually wanted a cabernet from California and nobody faulted me for that.I had already eaten at Whole Foods. I wish I'd only picked up a few items for the hotel mini-fridge and eaten at Place Pigalle. The food looked and smelled so good. From my seat at the bar, I could see all manner of mussels, scallops, fish, asparagus, salads, potatoes, etc. Ah, some other time. Some other time. I don't think I'll double back to this place, but if I could, I would. I'd LOVE to look out of this wimdow by day to catch the view. But, I sat there with my cab and the day's newspaper...dang...someone else already did the crossword....
After my last review, I got an email from the owner of Trago expressing a sincere apology for the experience that we had and a desire to make it up to us. We agreed.We went back on Friday evening, a week after our initial experience, and were pleasantly surprised with the difference. The restaurant was full but, by all appearances, it was better staffed. There was even a hostess in place to seat patrons. We had made reservations and were greeted with water and chips and salsa already on our table. Our waitress was helpful and was able to make recommendations. We ordered the artichoke dip appetizer (delicious) and Carne Asada and Enchiladas for our entrees. We also had margaritas and Spiced Rum and Ginger Ale (my favorite). The fact is, regardless of other experiences at Trago, their food is delicious--some of the best Mexican food I have had in this city. At one point during the meal, I declared to my husband that we would be returning here. The food is just too good to pass up. The owner stopped by our table while we were there and apologized again for our previous experience and thanked us for giving Trago another try. I was impressed with his concern and effort to make things right. Not all restaurant owners would go out on a limb like he did and I really appreciated it. It gave me a completely different perspective.I feel like service is still a bit slow and the fact that they are a new restaurant is sometimes recognizable in the mistakes that they make, but after this second experience at Trago, I would recommend it. The food is delicious, the staff was friendly, the owner is genuinely concerned about restaurant patrons. Trago is worth a shot. I hope you won't be disappointed. I'm always in the mood for mexican food so I was really excited when someone suggested this place!The food I thought was great. &#160;Chips were crispy, I had the chicken quesadilla and they didn't pull the signature Seattle move of dousing it with some weird red sauce which I highly appreciated.The service on the other hand was terrible. &#160;The restaurant was pretty empty, and we stood waiting for probably 10 minutes until someone came and told us to sit wherever. &#160;Once we sat, we ordered our drinks pretty quickly but it literally took them 20 minutes to bring us drinks and chips. &#160;We finished our chips in 5 minutes, and they never brought us another bowl!I would go back cause I liked the food, but they need to get some new staff! This whole little corner of SLU confuses me and sort of makes me sad. I think this used to be an Outback Steakhouse though, so at least a partial star for a major upgrade in offerings. I think?This place is huge.. I mean cavernous. If I wasn't going here for the express purpose of singing British New Wave in front of a bunch of strangers I might have not known where to go (luckily, it is easy to follow the warbblings of karaoke singers). &#160;The karaoke was hosted by Absolute, so always a good time -- even though I felt like I needed to wash my brain after a mother and son sang a duet about getting together in sexy-time ways. &#160;Since I couldn't cut open my skull I had a drink instead, and it was thankfully strong.Nachos were ordered and they were.. nachos. Not the best, but not the worst by any means. And I think they were HH priced so we got a LOT of them for a reasonable price.But, as Clover has mentioned -- the view is the winner here. There is something magical about looking out over at Lake Union and seeing the Armory all lit up and glowing in the darkness. Then again it might have been shiny cuz of the booze... The first thing that I thought before I entered Trago's doors was I hope that the place doesn't have the same luck that has befallen Outback Steakhouse and Bonefish Grill. The owners put a lot of work to turn the place into what seems like a restaurant and bar/dance spot (they have a live band and a little dance floor). Trago is a big place - the whole downstairs was closed with curtains and there signs directing us upstairs to the main dining area. A sign told us to seat ourselves even though there was an awkwardly placed hostess desk near the stairs. My three friends and I sat down and weren't helped for almost 15 minutes, which was due to only 2 servers for the entire Friday night dining crowd. The inside of Trago reminded me of Peso's restaurant on Queen Anne ...think low lighting, orange walls, metal light fixtures, and loud music. The only difference is that the food at Trago's wasn't as good. The food was OK and the portions were big, but I'm going for quality. Our two apps were the Anejo wings (sweet chili-glazed wings with cilantro) and the nachos. Our mains included the fajitas and the chicken enchiladas with traditional red sauce. The highlight of the meal was the anejo wings - perfectly fried and sweet and salty. With nachos, most of the time, you don't get enough toppings, but the Trago nachos actually had too much toppings that it was out of control. They were good, but nothing I haven't had before. The fajitas were definitely lacking spices and salt. The chicken enchiladas with red sauce was average. &#160;Their house margaritas were syrupy sweet due probably because of too much triple sec. Although there aren't a whole lot of Mexican restaurants in the SLU/Eastlake/Belltown area, my experience at Trago didn't convince me to go back anytime soon. We went here with a livingsocial coupon, which turned out to be a great deal. &#160;We were expecting a limited menu and small margaritas, but we were pleasantly surprised by strong margs and a full menu of options. The cerviche appetizer was awesome and well-portioned. You can tell that the restaurant is pretty new and they are still trying to work out the kinks. Example- we had to ask for silverware and napkins. &#160;However, the waitress was aware of the shortcomings we experiences and even comped a drink after a long wait for one of the entrees. If you are coming here for a casual dinner, be sure to be out by 10pm because they turn the music up and it becomes a club, unless you're into that sort of thing... I really like this place for the dancing. I really don't like the drink prices, table policy, and rude bouncers before closing. I felt like we were getting roughed up on the way out from the staff yelling at everyone to get out. There was a huge line and I wasn't leaving without my jacket. I paid for them to check it and it's not my fault they only have 2 girls giving out coats to 50 people on the way out. I really don't like the waitress downstairs on Saturday night the 18th of February.I would probably go more often and bring more girl friends, but don't want to have a bad experience after referring them to this place. I was already surprised we had to stand all night since you need to pay to sit at a table. I made reservations and got a call back letting us know after 10pm the tables are reserved for $175.00. WTH?? Are you serious? I think the bartenders did a good job. What are those Trago cards that the locals have anyway? My wife and I went here for the living social deal and had an excellent time. They accommodated gluten free meals without any complaints, even double-checking the ingredients. During late night the central area became a dance floor with overly loud music. Despite the loud music, the waitress was great, the food was delicious, and we felt like they appreciated our business. What in holy hell is happening? &#160;How does this even work? &#160;You open a bar and staff it with a single waitress on a Friday night? &#160;Your CO2 is out so no draft beer? &#160;Yet you remain open because you've also forgotten how to lock the front door? &#160;Help me to understand.I went there on a Friday night with a few friends, we couldn't hold a buzz to save our life because the (the one) waitress only came by our table every 30 minutes. &#160;She looked at me strange when I ordered the next round when I ordered the current round (I actually considered ordering all our drinks for the entire night). &#160;It was Friday, all I wanted was a draft beer, instead I was drinking Heinekens and my friends were drinking kool-aid based margaritas.Our food wasn't horrible, but everything else was. &#160;The only fun time we had was watching everyone come in with smiles on their faces all happy and what not. &#160;Then as they sat down and began their dining experience, their smiles turned to frowns. &#160;I even saw one patron crying, although a baby, I'm sure it was for the same reason.My friend's girlfriend actually used the men's restroom since there was no soap in the women's restroom. &#160;Which is not a bad thing necessarily but thought I would mention.EDIT: &#160;I've since updated this to 3 stars from 1 since the owner responded and explained the circumstances of that night. &#160;It's good to see that the owner is responsive and responsible. Great nachos...cool atmosphere...and Joy was awesome! restaurant by day and club by night. This place was crackin on saturday nights....FULL of Mexicans as expected...with great Spanish music! Downstairs u get more traditional spanish music the older crowd dances to with a full bar and everything. Upstairs is super packed...nearly impossible to walk through but if u can force ur way through spaces its not too bad...they got a full bar upstairs as well but its kinda hard to flag down a bartender to get a drink....upstairs is a mix of spanish hip hop and all sorts of remixes....great to dance to ESPECIALLY if ur hispanic and got that rhythm in ur blood already.....anyways....6 bucks for a beer? damn.....but oh well when u go out u gotta play hard! hahaha.....not too much drama which is good although a drunk guy tried to fight me in the bathroom because I touched him on accident on my way out....then we witnessed a fight break out outside the club after closing....really entertaining! great music and good dancing...it was a wonderful night indeed :)
I wasn't impressed. I came in tonight for dinner, impressed by the exterior and interior, super hungry and hoping to get a quick dinner. Instead, I got ignored by the waitstaff, overpriced and very mediocre food, and an atmosphere that was dominated by an already overserved, intoxicated bachlorette party. My mom ordered a pot of green tea which came out tepid (you could stick your finger in it and it was barely warmer than skin temperature) and strongly cut with mint tea- I know some people like their green tea cut with mint, but if I wanted mint tea, I would order mint tea. When we asked for a new pot, after numerous attempts to get the wait staffs attention, we were given a new pot with an armful of resentment. The pot was also chipped and really dirty- call me picky, but I've worked in enough kitchens where dirty and chipped cutlery wouldn't be used by back of house, let alone allowed to be left the kitchen. My Moms steak salad was... meh. Iceburg lettuce, mint, tomatoes, and steak. It was easily a third tomatoes, not bad, but my Mom can't eat tomatoes due to dietary reasons. $12, and she couldn't eat a third of it, which was disappointing for her. My massaman curry was boring. There was absolutley no spice, was mostly potato, and had four pieces of chicken, and for $14 ($2 for a side of rice, $16 total just for entree), I was pissed. I'm all for paying for good quality food in smaller portions, but I'm not kidding when I say Dicks Drive In leaves me more satisfied. I've heard good things about people who liked the phad thai, which is mixed table side, but again, my experience in kitchens made me wary: I saw both waiters use bare hands to tear up green onions, some flowery looking garnish, and lime. I'm really hoping their hands were clean and they washed their hands after wiping down tables, handling other food, and handling cash. If phad thai is your dish of choice, that looked good, but we weren't happy. My Mom wanted to come here, as she had come before and had exceptional food and really good service. We were both really disappointed. We got here early and marched upstairs to the dining room....hello, hello? &#160;Are you open? &#160;It took a bit of walking around for someone to come out and greet us. &#160;Seated by the window on a rainy day, we ordered some tom yum and the papaya salad to get something going quickly. &#160;The tom yum had lots of goodies inside and was pretty tart. &#160;My friend going back for the broth so it received a thumbs up from her. &#160;The papaya salad was sort of skimpy and disappeared in a few bites. &#160;The highlight of the evening was the pumpkin curry. &#160;Big chunks of kabocha and tofu swam around in a rich yellow curry. &#160;Tasty. &#160;We also had a seafood dish that had huge scallops in it, along with some squiddite rings and a few shrimp. &#160;Not bad, but bland in comparison to the curry.Not worth a special trip out to here, but not bad. &#160;It's not that inexpensive, which surprised me a bit. There is an understated quaint charm hidden here under the pitched roof and at my last lunch visit, it was revealed even more so than my previous visits.The food is good, not better than many of the other thai places, but definitely good. The prices fair but not low. The service was good but not outstanding.The atmosphere though, tucked in a booth in the middle of a rainy day for an intimate tete a tete, was definitely just what I was looking for. Food served in bar unitl 1AM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This little bit of new information is going to change my boyfriend's and my life!;-) How did we never know this until now! We love their Phad Thai so this is amazing to us.:)Best Chicken Phad Thai food in Seattle I've decided. &#160;I've been to a few different establishments, and I have to admit that I mainly only order Chicken Phad Thai, so I feel I can safely say that to me their's is the most delicious. I've had multiple dishes at May and they are all amazing as well! Their Panang Curry is great!The service in the bar area can run a little hot and cold. Upstairs the ladies are always very sweet though. Love this place. Green curry is amazing. They recommend it and you should eat it. Pad thai id delicious, they mix it for you at the tablr. Absolutely delicious... No damn ketchup in the sauce. They have an eggplant dish that is also amazing. I recommend the lychee cocktail too. It can get a bit crowded since its not to big but trust me its awesome. In the summer its perfect to have dinner upstairs at sunset Driving up front, you see a sign "happy HOur" &#160;and we go upstairs to grab some thai food and a beer. &#160;Come to find out, the happy hour is only downstairs....darn! &#160;Oh well we ordered our beer and food. &#160; &#160;The food was a-ok, but I must say the veggie dish and phad thai was extremely overpriced in comparison with other thai restaurants coming in at $14 a dish.....Higher than I have ever seen it. &#160;Atmosphere was nice. &#160;Vegetarian menu was not clear, and the waitress actually had to go back to see if an item could be made without fish sauce....sigh. &#160;Service was good, but higher priced than makes me happy.... so I probably won't be back. may is, without a doubt, the best thai food around. it moves thai food out of the $5 hole-in-the-wall category (which is awesome for sure!) into a whole new level. the only other place that might be similar in terms of thai interpretation would be indochine in tacoma, which is not only more expensive, it's not as good. Food was great (I got the Beef Phad See Ew)! They used quality ingredients, especially the beef; it wasn't the usual cheap, fatty cuts of beef from fast food thai places. Me and my best friend went on a Thursday around 5:30 p.m. and there was no wait and no one there, which made a very nice, peaceful environment. I love the decor inside and outside (on the top floor), it gave the whole experience a better vibe. The only downfall was that even though there were maybe 7 other people there, it took our 2 entrees a total of 20-30 minutes to come out and the waitresses lagged to come over even when we caught their eye. The Pad Thai is AMAZING and the service is very fast. &#160;I've eaten here many times and it's always delicious. &#160;I've tried a few things on the menu, but I always come back to the Pad Thai with fried tofu. &#160;It's the best Pad Thai I've had in Seattle. &#160;They also have a nice lunch special if you eat downstairs. &#160;Highly recommended! Best thai ive had in a long time. They mix the pad thai at table too!Got a 2 (out of 3) hotness and mouth was on fire, but im sensitive to hot food. Food tasted so good, the pain didnt matter!! Yum! &#160;5 star Phad Thai, delicious pork satay.The Curry was nothing special and kind of bland.Great comfortable ambience, and some unique presentations of some of their cuisine. &#160;Will be back to see if the average curry was a fluke or not.Will also have to get a closer look at the happy hour next time. Meh. I love garlic, but their dishes were just excessive with it.... so excessive that it kind of took away the flavors. Their food is also a little bit on the hot side, so maybe take it down a notch and get one star below what you would normally get. I probably won't come back.
Went today and ordered the Miso Charsiu Ramen and a side of Gyoza.I am giving 3 stars because the Gyoza where tasty and crispy. &#160;The Ramen on the other hand was not so tasty, the broth was bland, noodles where a little Soft and the Charsiu pieces where small, thin and not very flavorful. &#160;The Ramen and Gyoza together where 11.00 so a little on the pricier side for lunch. &#160;The Mongolian Beef Bento that my friend was eating looked good and she seemed to like it. &#160;It was a nice clean establishment and they had a nice selection of condiments. Unlike the dirty outside surroundings of the ID, the restaurant is remarkably clean and well kept. You wouldn't notice that from just walking by or looking in from the outside.Food - We ordered the Mongolian Beef, Spicy &amp; Sour Chicken, Won Ton Soup, and pot stickers - all for about $23 w/out tip. The Mongolian Beef tasted like Beef Stew and nothing like the Mongolian Beef I am used to having in SF or NY. Not bad, but I wished that it didn't taste like beef stew. The Chicken was better but I wished it had a bit more kick to it as far as spiciness and tanginess goes but the dish was pretty good otherwise. These two "bento" Chinese boxes for lunch came w/ salad, two curry wontons and a scoop of white rice. Overall, a good value for the price. &#160;I did not care for the Won Ton Soup. Tasted like the broth was just made w/ lots of soy sauce for flavoring and I couldn't taste anything else.Service was excellent. The staff here speak both Chinese and Japanese. Came back to try the ramen...afterall these cold Seattle days pretty much beckon you to get a hot bowl of noddles. &#160;I ordered the Tonkotsu Chasu Ramen with a side of gyoza. &#160;The soup was good but not as rich as its competition down the street. &#160;The pork was sliced thin but had an off taste...they must have marinated it in some seasoning that made it taste a little sour to me. &#160;The bamboo shoots were also odd tasting...the right texture but the wrong taste. &#160;The gyoza were good as usual and would come back here in a second for more. &#160;I think next on the list is to try a lunch special here to see if that offsets the inconsistency in their food, for me at least. Did I mention hole in the walls have some of the best food ever? Fu Lin is one of these great places. Unfortunately I have not experienced anything else but the ramen and gyoza, but dammit they do those both right! Fu Lin is a hole in the wall place near Wajis in Seattle. This place has a large menu of food primarily Chinese, but since I found this place with a friend of mine all I have ordered is the ramen. They do ramen right here. It has amazing broth with all the pieces. The staff is always friendly and attentive. If you are in the international district and you'd like a light lunch I recommend Fu Lin for sure! Great place for ramen and gyoza! Each time I come here I have been really happy with the food. The ramen is large sized and really filling and the gyoza is some of the best around. Can't go wrong with this place, just don't let the outside persuade you from not going in, its a little run down, but the inside is clean and nice. Service is friendly and attentive and the pricing is nice too. All around good place to eat! The ramen here is my favorite in Seattle and that says a lot because I've had some good ramen in this city. &#160;I ususally go between the miso and shoyu ramen, the noodles are always cooked perfectly and the broth is perfectly seasoned as well. &#160;I usually get a side order of fried rice and I think its only like 3.99 extra for a huge plate which is a crazy deal. &#160;Although I usually only get the ramen I have tried a few of their other dishes, which is all Chinese, and haven't been disappointed either. &#160;Their general Tso chicken is amazing. It can be busy during peak lunch and dinner hours but normally its not too bad and its very cheap. &#160;In fact writing this is giving me the craving, I guess its ramen for dinner :-)
A for effort. If you happen to be stuck with some vegetarians - coming here will satisfy them since EVERYTHING is vegetarian. But if you can, avoid this place! I (half-heartedly) recommend:- Tom Yum noodle soup- Yellow curry noodle soup- Fried wontonsCould pass on:- Tamarind stir fry noodles (did not balance tamarind well with dish, ended up more sour than I would've liked)- Yellow curry stir fry noodles (was not a standout like their curry noodle soup)- Thai iced tea/coffee (too sweet) Grub! &#160;Score a window seat for the fresh air and weirdo-watching. &#160;Good food, delicious, spicy and friendly staff. &#160;Clean, but small dining area. &#160;Walked up here after the gym on a perfectly sunny day. &#160;Conveniently located nearby the cool Starbucks and a stroll from Top Pot Doughnuts! &#160;Monkey do:FINDING ANGEL - peanut sauce over soft tofu with spinach and brown rice. &#160;You can have your choice of soft or fried tofu, choice of spinach, bok choy or (i think)broccoli and brown or white rice.EGGPLANT CURRY - spicy, flavorful veggies and brown rice. &#160;Your choice of hotness and rice. &#160;Can't wait for our next visit! Love any of the 'noodle episodes' here! And my favorite 'accompany buddies espisode' is of course, the vegan chicken nuggets. oftentimes when I'm hanging out next door at The Bus Stop (bar), I'll sneak over to ITB for a nostalgiac snack.Their veggie beef is the shit. I usually forget, when taking newbies to In the Bowl, to ask the newbie what their spice tolerance is like. That is pretty pertinent here at ITB. I've been coming here for years, so I'm unphased by every bite being covered in chili flakes, however I can see it being difficult for some unaccustomed to the experience.You kinda gotta speak up for service here from time to time. It's pretty casual so they're not going to notice you twiddling your thumbs--waiting to get your check/more water/napkins/etc. say something and you'll get that something!Anyway, I love this place! I only docked a star because I do see a lot of people frustrated about 'service' every time I'm at the restaurant, but a word to customers of any kind-- the only change you can make is with yourself--not others! I'm so happy to have tried this place... been a while since I get that excited about a new restaurant! :)I came back twice within a week...I tried the fish and the tofu (but not crazy about the prawns). I can't wait to try other fake meats. The noodles dishes are amazing, awesome selection of sauces and type of noodles. The Bangkok fried rice was also pretty good. I haven't yet tried any of the appetizers but will do next time, soon!! I do like this place, but I am not head over heels for this place.I do enjoy the garlic mania because it is filled with garlic and noodles, but for the price, I could get better quality vegetarian stir fry noodles at buddha ruska in west seattle. I wish i could give this place a 3 star because it is good, but not amazingly great where I'd drive to this place.but I would recommend the tom yum style noodle soup and the garlic mania In the Bowl is my go-to restaurant. I have ordered at least 10 different dishes, and all of them have been fantastic. The veggies are so fresh, the sauces just light enough, and the spices fantastic! My favorites are probably the Spicy Noodles, Royal Noodles, Tokyo Noodles ... okay, I could actually list the whole menu.They're also super fast with the food. A warning - if you don't like spicy, order 1 "chile" (star). They make them spicier than most are used to. I usually order a 3, but my parents thought even 1 was a tad spicy (they hate spice, so that explains a lot). I love meat and the best part about this Vegetarian joint is that it doesn't focus on making the fake meat. Fresh vegetables cooked well. Do note that though the food comes fast once you order, it's sometimes difficult to 1. get their attention to order to begin with 2. to pay after you're done.I'm usually a huge fan of Tom Yum soup but there was just too much mint for my taste. I did, by yelper's suggestions, try the melting culture and it was DELICIOUS. Get that food out of the bowl and into my belleh! REALLY SPICY - start off with a 1 or 2!Got the Pineapple Curry and Soy Protein tofu plus the Tamarind and Peanut Sauce Noodle chicken. Really confusingly good menu and quick presentation of food.People come in/out quickly and the service seems even speedier- which is great, because there are only a few tables. Worth a try, but not worth being a regular. In many other cities (I'm looking at you, middle states), vegans/vegetarians are like unicorns or the chupacabra; mythical, elusive creatures that people have heard of but never seen. Ask a restaurant for a vegan option and they'll tell you they can make a grilled cheese sandwich and the story ends with you nibbling on a leaf of lettuce. Joy.In Seattle, vegan sightings are like seeing zebras on a safari. They walk amongst us mere mortals with their rice milk lattes, kale chips, and super-human self-discipline. They also give very good restaurant recommendations.One such recommendation found me sitting at In The Bowl with a steaming bowl of Melting Culture (some sort of coconuty curry dip with ground beef-like vegetarian 'meat' &#160;and delicious roti triangles to scoop it up) in front of me. First bite, heaven. Second bite, delicious. Third bite, "this has quite the kick!" I thought to myself. Fourth bite, my face felt like it was going to melt off. Like other reviewers have mentioned, this place is spicy. But I may be slightly (**cough, cough** VERY) biased on the spice factor since I am notorious for ordering things 'zero star' spice level. The burn didn't stop me from gobbling it all down though and, boy, was it GOOD! The Melting Culture dish was phenomenal. I followed that up with the phad see ew which, while also very good, was a pretty standard dish. Seeing the magic they worked with the Melting Culture, I sort of wish I had been more adventurous and asked what they recommended/what other unique plates they had available since I feel like they likely have some truly awesome gems on the menu. Come Monday, I'll be thanking my vegan co-worker for the wonderful recommendation and will be being a bit more ambitious with my tobasco/sriracha:food ratio to prep for my next trip to In The Bowl so I can roll with the big boys. I wasn't so thrilled with my first visit here (mostly due to the cactus I stuck my arm on). The second visit, we thought we were going to a different restaurant (they must have hired a really good photographer for their website, because we didn't recognize it!), but we didn't have time to change our plans. We noted that the cactus had been removed, and enjoyed our meal.Between that visit and the next time we came to Seattle, I began to crave the dish I'd ordered at In the Bowl both times (N 10. Spicy Noodle with wide noodles and 'chicken'). Soooooooo, now we go there EVERY time we go to Seattle, and dream of it in-between. I now consider myself impressed. I agree with other reviewers: servers are attentive, and food is received VERY quickly! One of the male servers always wears athletic sandals with bare feet, which could be a turn off for some diners. And the interior is indeed "unfinished," which is why we didn't recognize the fancy photos on their website. This bothered me on my first two visits until I decided that the awesome food trumped the dumpy atmosphere. It is WORTH IT. Love love love the food! Cheap, spicy, and delicious.In The Bowl reminds me of the great little cafes all over Bangkok. &#160;It's small, jam-packed, and appears to be furnished with decades old toy furniture.Everything on the menu is vegetarian (even though this is not clearly indicated). &#160;I'm not a fan of fake meat, but their fried tofu was yumyum. This may have been one of the best places to eat within Seattle. &#160;I'm quite picky when it comes to vegetarian food. &#160;The place is awesome. &#160;I believe the restaurant is owned by Thai Buddhists. &#160;The won't even allow you to bring in anything that has animal products in them (e.g. coffee with cream or milk). I was really craving noodles in soup and curry. &#160;Luckily, they had that - sort of similar to that of laksa (but no fish). &#160;I had the vegetarian fish -- absolutely delicious. &#160;The only problem was that the vegetables weren't very fresh. &#160;Otherwise, great atmosphere. &#160;Very calming. It is not a bad place. The staff was friendly and smiley. The food was plentiful but definitely not the best. Of all the items on the menu, my boyfriend and I somehow ended up with dishes (stir-fried green bean with wide rice noodles and spicy eggplant with brown rice) that turned out to be extremely similar, which was rather disappointing.The green bean dish had barely any of the namesake vegetable. It should have been called "carrot" instead.I appreciated the complimentary dessert though. So yummy! Sadly, they don't do delivery anymore. Yum! Went here on the recommendation of a fried looked over their menu on-line and it looked good. &#160;Although we though when it said chicken etc it meant chicken not 'chicken', even though there was vegetarian in the name. &#160;I went with tofu because of the language barrier I was unsure if their fake meat had wheat in it, it is soy-based though.Anyways on to the food. &#160;The yellow curry was amazing the best tasting yellow curry I ever had. &#160;The pieces of tofu were a little too big for me and were difficult to half, but if that's my only complaint I'll be back!This place is really small eat early or not on the weekends I could see them getting packed. &#160;Not sure if they take reservations. &#160;They do have a lot of people ordering to-go. This is such a fun hole-in-the-wall! There's an overall grooviness and a relief for vegan folks who are tired of limited choices.It can be a bit drafty, but the food is amazing, the service friendly, and there are a great many options on the menu. The portions are fine; one entree will fill a hungry hippie, but not more.I've loved all their curries, especially the Yellow Curry. Also, the Spicy Eggplant is delicious. I've heard good things about their soups as well. My friend took me to this restaurant a couple of months ago and now I'm ruined for all other Thai restaurants. I'm a vegan (at least 99% of the time) so Thai is always a good option for me when eating out. The yellow curry noodle soup here is so good I can't eat anything else...although I always try to convince someone else to order the pad see ew so that I can share some. The yellow curry soup has a blend of sixteen spices which they mix themselves. I prefer fresh tofu with my meals, but I've tried the "chicken" and was really pleasantly surprised. I haven't had anything that I didn't like, but that soup is like the song of the sirens.... Teapot closed, so in desperation BF and I revisited this place. I stuck to the least fuckupable option: garlic noodles (udon) with fried tofu. The vegetables were actually cooked. The waitress was very nice. An improvement. OK, so everything may taste the same there, but if you stick with certain safe options it's possible to have a yummy dish there.The bathroom is still the main attraction, though. While general enjoy my eating experience at this restaurant, but horrible services.. As I finished eating but still had half my noodles left. The waitress came over and didn't even ask if I was finish took my bowl away. I thought she had boxed my leftovers but instead had thrown it away. When I asked did she boxed my leftovers she said "you didn't ask for a box". Not even an apology and now it's my fault that I didn't say anything. I really hate it when folks plays the victim..... Being happy and comfortable in my status as an omnivore -- Im always pleasantly pleased when I come across places like In the Bowl. While I have no intentions to eschew meat anytime in the near future, the possibility of doing so seems easier with places like this around. Needing to kill some time and realizing we were hungry -- we popped over to In the Bowl to share an appetizer and an entree. We were sat in the front corner (which &#160;sadly resulted in us being forgotten/neglected a little more than the rest of this tiny restaurant) and placed an order for their Garlic Mania Noodles with "duck" and their fried vegan wontons. &#160;The wontons were crisp, flavorful -- and dare I say I like these way better than normal crab &amp; cream cheese iterations? Yes I dare -- cuz they were effing good and served as a good "coolant" for the noodles we ordered at a crazy 5 star heat level. Im not 100% sure it WAS 5 stars, considering they say they are spicier than other Thai places around town -- but the heat built up nicely as I ate my meal and I drank puh-lenty of water. The fake duck was hardly duck like in taste or texture, but provided something interesting and yummy among our thin rice noodles. The broccoli was cooked perfectly in our noodles dish as well and I may have stole all the pieces of it. Oops! Overall the flavors were great, and the portion sizes just right for &#160;a filling but not gut busting meal. And even though we were sharing an entree they brought us both forbidden rice pudding. The prices seemed a little higher (a dollar or two) than comparable cuisine, &#160;but as far as Thai food goes this is some of the better stuff I have had in the city limits proper -- vegetarian or not withstanding! So definitely worth a wee bit higher price tag in my opinion. I will happily go back or order for delivery when a noodle or curry craving strikes. This place continues to have the best fake beef!! I love the melting culture and their monthly specials. This is a great place to grab a quick bite. &#160;The portions and prices are perfect! Very solid vegetarian Thai food - most things are delicious.Standouts are the Melting Culture appetizer, and brown fried rice. &#160;Best of the faux-meats is the beef. &#160; Service is fast and price is reasonable. &#160;Hurray for In the Bowl! The first time I came here, I got horribly sick afterwards, and yet I'm still giving this place four stars. &#160;That should tell you something about their deliciousness, my poor judgment, or both. I'm done with this place, too.The food is all right, but the staff is rude. I could care less if a waiter is nice to me, but to be blatantly hostile, time and again, without reason, that's just not something I'm comfortable with. Surprisingly delicious! I was extremely skeptical when we first arrived and we froze sitting so close to the door, which continued to be opened by patrons and staff, but the food was SOOOOO GOOOOOOD. I absolutely adore perfectly fried tofu and In the Bowl knows how it's done well. Yum yum! The vegetables in my dish were fresh and delicious. Just thinking about that awesome meal is making me want to go to Seattle! Definitely check it out, especially if you're vegetarian or vegan! NOT 100 % VEGANAfter eating here for several years I found out that most of their faux meat contains whey. The two protein choices for vegans at In The Bowl are tofu or faux shrimp. Absolutely a must go. I used to live right next to it. Since I have moved away, I miss it so bad. I think I have tried 80% of the menu, and you cannot go wrong with anything here.Parking is a big problem around the restaurant. The food here was delicious. I tried three different appetizers, and all were awesome. So much vegetarian fare! My only caveat would be: when you're ready to place your order... BE READY! The servers do not have time for you to be making decisions while they take your order, so be ready to rattle off your order and related options. I am still really pleased with the food (if you are careful about ordering). However, the service is pretty spotty.I order for delivery on a regular basis, and the delivery guy is extremely nice!!However, the women who answer the phone can either be very pleasant or very rude. Today, she was very rude. When I called to place my order, they were out of three different appetizers that I was trying to order. I was 50 cents under the minimum for delivery, and really didnt want anything else that was on the menu. I offered to pay the 50 cents as an extra part of the delivery fee, or could get a side of peanut sauce ($2) which I think is pretty nice considering they were out of so much of their menu. The woman just asked me if I wanted spring rolls and was quite shrill when saying "It is a $20 minimum"- which I guess is a passive agressive way of saying no. I ordered the spring rolls and will tip the nice delivery guy as usual. I just wish that they could find someone nicer to answer the phone - maybe someone who is at least apologetic when they are out of 3 different items that I try to order. I've been coming to In The Bowl for a few years - alone, with a date, with five other people (not necessarily recommended). It's small, bright, bustling, and full of sparkly gold decor, probably a few maneki nekos.Everything I've tried has been consistently delicious, but two things I keep coming back for are the veggie-filled Garlic Mania Noodle (with beef and udon -- but you can get whatever faux meat, tofu or noodles you want) and Yellow Curry (which has potatoes, cherry tomatoes, and roti on the side). My go-to sick food at one point was their chicken and vegetable soup -- add noodles for a bit extra.I've only had one disappointing experience here, when they had just changed their hours from 9:30 to 9:00 and were trying to hurry everyone out whilst hastily serving half-assed versions of their normally wonderful curry. I assume they worked it out.When pumpkin curry is in season, totally get that. Or the faux chicken nuggets appetizer, or the green curry, or the pad see ew, or y'know, anything on the menu. The duck is remarkably better than the chicken, so order that if you're feeling spendy. And don't forget a thai iced coffee or tea!The free dessert is actually not sticky rice; it's warm cooked adzuki beans with what appears to be some corn and coconut milk (not condensed milk! Neat.) In the summer they serve orange slices instead, which is not nearly as exciting. If I used Foursquare and weren't broke, I'd probably be the mayor of this place [pushes up glasses]! Tasty food and cheap as can be! Great food to get delivered, but the restaurant is adorable too! Everything is really spicy though, so don't be afraid to order a 1 or 2 unless you're really into getting your taste buds burned off. :P &#160;Such a tasty place! Love In the Bowl. Don't need meat when you cook food this good.
I sincerely believe Homegrown has/had the potential to knock my socks off, and if I stopped by at a random hour to buy a sandwich I might be happy. As it was, I stopped by for lunch on a weekend and it was my worst food mistake in MONTHS.I waited nearly an hour, AN HOUR, for a cup of soup and half-salad. I want to be forgiving because they appeared to be training someone new, but one of the cooks kept shouting for a time-check like it was Top Chef, and shouting at other staff in general and it just felt weird to be there with hordes of annoyed customers. I watched them get at least 2 orders wrong, and they must have been averaging 5-7 minutes per sandwich, making them one...at...a...time.The soup is made ahead of time, and the salad consisted of arugula, beets and goat cheese. The turkey lentil soup was really tasty, the salad kind of meh (I expected roasted beets but had slices of boiled beets, not necessarily a deal-breaker)-- the food definitely did not warrant an hour wait. I'm giving 4 stars for responsiveness to feedback.I returned to Homegrown to a surprisingly affordable and enjoyable lunch. &#160;Seems like they've added "small" sandwiches on the menu, and this has upped the value of their lunches in my book. &#160;I had a $5 small pork loin sandwich with apple butter on potato roll, along with a $2 white bean salad. &#160;For $7, this place has seemingly responded to requests for bigger value (given the economy and local competition right around the corner) with some aggressive values along with interesting sandwiches. &#160;Kudos for reading your Yelp feedback, and working to improve the value you provide the community. Used to be 5 stars, but now the crab sandwich is gone. &#160;Apparently some of you were complaining (whining?) about prices, my suggestion is that you should go buy your own crab and make it at home, will cost you at least $7-8 on your own with all the toppings!I came here specifically to buy unique things that I wouldn't make at home but they appear to be moving downscale in prices which limits them to be like most other delis. &#160;Sad.Should have a fast to-go (read made each morning) menu for the speed people who want lower prices and 2nd, longer wait-while-it-is-made menu for people who were hoping for high-end, local cafe food. Let me start by saying this place would be a 5 if they did 2 things:1. Expand the sandwich menu2. Drop the prices by 2 dollars per sandwichOtherwise this place is fantastic. &#160;Great sandwiches, amazing meat, and the rosemary fries are to die for. &#160;The only problem is, they only offer 3 or 4 sandwiches so their lunch menu is pretty weak. &#160;They do offer an awesome looking breakfast but I've yet to try it. &#160;The best sandwich is the Turkey, Bacon, Avacado. &#160;It's real turkey and not that crappy processed stuff. &#160;Also the bacon is bad ass. &#160;One other note: &#160;They serve beer. &#160;Yes, that is awesome. &#160;A descent selection of 3 or 4 micro brews to wash down that sandwich.Because of its location, I love going there on a Sunday for a short walk in downtown Queen Ann. Not a kid friendly menu, service is slow for a take out place, seating is microscopic and sandwiches are over priced enough that I won't go (without my kid) but every once and a while. Seating is limited which would not be so bad if the service was fast so folks were not waiting around in such a cramped place for so long. Waited an hour for 2 sandwiches for over an hour. &#160;The PB sandwich for over $5.00 was not worth the price. The peanut butter and marshmallow sandwich for a 4 year old was burned on the inside (attempt to toast the marshmallow I guess) and the bread was toasted to it's death on the outside. There was so little peanut butter that I did not see it over the burnt marshmallow. Regardless I returned it. And asked for an untoasted pb sandwich for my kid who does not like to eat black food. The menu did not state that the sandwich was toasted or we would have ordered it untoasted. The staff very reluctantly made an untoasted one. They seemed insulted that we returned it. My po boy was okay. Nice and spicy. The slaw was hardly "south carolina style" but tasty none the less. The vegetarian options are limited and everything comes with bacon. A few more non-bacon options would be nice. Oh Homegrown you have made an attempt at something good but missed the target unfortunately. First experience was when you first opened and we had to wait for around 1 hour for a sandwhich I could have just made at home. Why do you cut your fries into extremely small pieces? Are we supposed to use a fork to eat them?Second experience was today and what prompted me to actaully sign-up for Yelp. I use other peoples reviews all the time but this is my first review. Your clam chowder was a sad attempt. Not only lacking in flavor but it was completely watered down. The meatloaf BLT, really? The slice of meatloaf was so small I almost thought they left it off. Sorry HomeGrown I wish you were better, maybe I need to try it one more time?Sad Foodie Stumbled on this place looking for a spot on upper queen anne with wi-fi besides boring Starbucks. &#160;Loved the concept when I walked in. &#160;My veggie sandwich was okay, but needed salt. &#160;The noise in here is distracting, and sadly for me, the wi-fi was really slow and dropped me a few times. &#160;The fries look really tasty, may have to try it again for those! Sloooow. Even with a long line, the staff will stop and talk to each other about gossip. Go to the Fremont location instead. I want to give the place 5 stars and beyond for their mission of local and organic...BUT...I felt a little cheated. The food was good but pricey.I understand the price reflects the attempt to be sustainable but if you're going to charge $8-$10 for a sandwich, the execution needs be stellar. We didn't get that.My husband's catfish po'boy fell apart because the roll got too soggy from too much sauce. Plus catfish tasted 'off'.My Reuben was small and on the cold side. &#160;Maybe I got the end of the loaf of bread. &#160;As for being 'cold, it was warmed/grilled/toasted just enough to melt the cheese but that was it. In the minutes from making it to my consumption, it was cooling off and the cheese was no longer warm and melty like a reuben should be and the meat was just room-temp.I doubt I will go back. Good but not great. It just wasn't memorable outside of being overpriced poorly executed sandwiches. Im giving this place 2 stars not for the food but because they always mess up my order. When they first opened in Queen Anne I looked at the menu online and was stoked to try the BLUFFERNUTTER make no mistake this is the grown up version with bacon. I ordered it to go and it was awesome. I grew up eating the plain old fluffernutter as a kid, but this was way better. We always get our sandwiches to go because it's a little spot with not a lot of seating which is fine I live close by. The first time I order the Bluffernutter is the ONLY time I have gotten what I have ordered. Which sucks because I raved to everyone I knew about how awesome it was. Usually when we order we get home and I have the kid version with apples. What gives I paid $7 for my awesome Bluffernutter sandwich with bacon on Pullman bread but I got a kids sandwich, which is not the same at all. So yesterday my family was in town and having heard me say how awesome the Bluffernutter was my dad wanted to try it. To be fair I blogged about how awesome it was! I was hesitant to let him get it as I wasn't sure what he would get. We went there ordered our sandwiches to go and saw the guy write down BLUFFERNUTTER and paid the price for the adult one but when we got home and started handing out everyones sandwiches we were left with a kid fluffernutter sandwich with apple slices! This time the bread was over toasted almost burnt and it had little marshmallow on it and it was just a lame version of a sandwich I could make at home. Which I ended having to pull out the marshmallow fluff so my dad could salvage his sandwich. YOU ARE KILLING ME HOMEGROWN!
This place is an experience to say the least. &#160;It's located in probably the shadiest part of town and is pretty sketchy from inside and outside. &#160;But the food is pretty darn good. &#160;I had the chicken kebab plate, which came with 2 tasty, tender, well-spiced kebabs over seasoned basmati rice, a little salad, hummus, and fresh pita. &#160;It was a huge plate of food for not a lot of money. And the owner even gave us a pitcher of fresh squeezed mango juice!
I said it before and I'll say it again: Il Fornaio has the best chicken salad ever. The black pepper and celery really does wonders.I very recently learned, however, that Il Fornaio is now sells boxed lunches. For $10, you get a mini fruit salad, a bag of chips (and not those nasty ass Tim's chips but Ms. Vicky's chips from Canada), and a whole sandwich. The sandwich that I choose is the chicken salad, obviously and it's easily my favorite sandwich downtown. The bread doesn't tear or leak making it the cleanest sandwich to eat while at the office. I'm pretty sure this is all I'm going to eat for the next week.I wish the packaging was a little more friendly though. The boxed lunches come in a giant plastic container, which is bulky to carry back to work and just goes straight to the recycling because I'd rather eat on a plate. we had the daily pasta and the pizza contadina and both were excellent selections....wasn't expecting this to be such a scrumptious Italian treat in downtown Seattle Ya know...just 'cause it is a chain...doesn't mean it don't do good... Seriously am here almost once a week...usually sit at the bar; or one of their bar tables. They are consistently very, very good; and the bartenders are AWESOME. Il Fornaio has one of the best Beef Carpacchios in the city. Thinly sliced; with Grana Parmesan, capers and truffle oil. OMG. Heaven. On more than one occasion...have ordered more than one... Another bene of sitting at the bar is the Olives...they are spiced; and served in the aforementioned oil...yummmmy! Their specialty cocktails are always very good. Currently, cannot stay away from the Ginger Mojito. So...for just a chill place; great atmosphere, awesome appetizers and cocktails downtown, this is one of my favorites. (But avoid it at Happy Hour; it may be free; but it is frenzied with people that are trying to get free food; and while it is free; it is very pedestrian...kinda like a Vegas buffet)(I also avoid the downstairs...a bit of a cafeteria atmosphere) I was here last week celebrating a birthday. I would give this place 3.5 stars.Service: Awesome. Our server waited patiently and continuously check in on all. &#160;He was attentive and friendly. 5 star here.Food: &#160;I had the seafood pasta under the house specialty section and the food was nothing to brag about. &#160; I was somewhat disappointed relative to my expecations. &#160;2 Stars.(5 + 2)/2=3.50 It's been a long time since I've been through the salad line. I used to come through all the time till I got burned out. Saturday afternoon, I realized, once again, &#160;how really really good and convenient it is. Grab your choice of greens, tell them what you like in it and poof! You're out. I love the way each salad gets a fresh bowl and tongs to mix it up; there's no threat of cross-contamination between veggies and meats. Plus, all the employees are fast, efficient, and really nice. I still have yet to find better Cannelloni. I have tried at many places to find a replacement but it can't be done. I'll keep coming back for more as long as they have it. Service is usually good but occasionally your waiter seems distant; luckily the food makes up for it. Had the seafood pasta and grilled seafood skewers. &#160;Seafood on the skewers were fresh but over seasoned. &#160;The pasta was a mish mash of sauce, overcooked pasta and seafood. &#160;The dish lacked distinct flavor, just salty and saucy.We ordered what we thought were two iced tea/lemonade mix. &#160;A few slurps and the glass was empty. &#160;It turned out there are no refills so we were charged repeatedly for what would normally be refillable drinks (that were mostly ice anyways) at over $3 a pop.The waiter was not particularly attentive, stopping by once only when I flagged him down.With all the other restaurants in the area, I think I will be spending my money elsewhere. &#160;Especially when I paid for a full dinner when happy hour was in full swing. &#160;Very disappointing since I had a much better experience in previous visits. Stopped in the morning for a pastry and coffee in the atrium - no complaints.Went again to the bar for happy hour after shopping. Food and service were good. However, the bartenders did not know a fairly simple drink and we had to look up the recipe for them. Convenient and a great stop for a bite when you're shopping! One of my favs for happy hour! This is a great place to buy lunch. Located in a very great area, Pacific Place in downtown Seattle. I always get the the salad bowls. You pick the lettuce in a bowl. An employee takes it and you get 5 choices of ingredients to add. For less than $10 smackers, you get a full meal and very quick lunch. Nice atmosphere, friendly and convenient. Would recommend to any one on the go. Oh yeah, good fresh food. Love it. I came here for a post-shopping lunch with my mom today and really enjoyed my meal! Delicious food, great service, nice vibe. The pre-meal bread w/olive oil and balsamic is soooo tasty. I ordered the Tagliatelli alla Bolognese pasta dish. It was amazing- fresh, hearty, flavorful, with fresh Parmesan grated on top by the waiter at the table. My one peeve is that the sauce was scalding, like mouth-burning hot, and no one warned me before I dug in :-/ Ouch! No worries though, I will for sure go back. I also loved the Blackberry Lemonade!Oh yeah - it was really reasonable too. Just $35 total for the two of us! I'd like to thank Spencer, my server, for the excellent customer service I received. I made dinner reservations since it was Seattle Restaurant Week. I went with my co-workers. We were seated on the west side of the restaurant near the window. The linens and tableware were clean. We were greeted by Spencer. He gave us food recommendations on the restaurant week menu as well as the regular menu. He was very friendly and maintained a professional attitude. The bread selection was tasteful and went well with the olive oil/vinegar combination. I chose the Caprese for my appetizer. Delicious. I chose the Salmone alla Griglia for my entr&#233;e. I only ate half because I wanted room for dessert. I had the Tiramisu. Heavenly. Spencer noticed that I didn't finish my food so he asked if I wanted it boxed up. I did and he boxed it up for me. I really liked the ambiance. Open. Not crowded. It's a great place to celebrate a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary. This update is for the Happy Hour only!I wasn't the biggest fan of this place during my first review when I went for regular dinner. &#160;The Happy Hour is a different story. &#160;between 430pm-630pm &#160;they have free appetizers! Yikes!The caveat is you are either at the bar which isn't so bad or the tall tables which sits two. &#160;As you can imagine things get filled up pretty quickly. &#160;The 'Free-ness' was a suprise to me but dove in with gusto. &#160;Tonight they featured a variety of appetizers: chicken wings, caprese, brushetta w/ olive tapenade, crab cakes, mini-chicken salad sandwiches. &#160; You have to buy a drink of course, I got a diet coke for I think $2.50? But with that you can pretty much serve yourself as much as you want! &#160;Insanity! &#160;The stuff was okay, not the greatest either but the price really is hard to beat. &#160;Service was very friendly and the free eats was replaced pretty regularly and with a decent variety. &#160;Definitely decent choice for a happy hour in the downtown! I went to Il Fornaio for dinner last night with my boyfriend and a couple of our friends for Restaurant Week. 3 courses for $25 = a pretty good deal, if you go for the more expensive restaurants. However, the food here was mediocre at best, and I might have given this place a two-star rating, if it wasn't for the friendly waiter who gave us complimentary bruschetta. Extra points also go to the ambiance and friendly staff. But the food... Eh.... I've had better from Cheesecake Factory.For appetizer, I chose the caprese and the boyfriend chose the calamari. The caprese was pretty standard. Not bad nor terribly delicious. The calamari, however, was very bland. I think someone forgot to season it. Even with the marinara dipping sauce, it was still very bland. So far, not so good.For entree, I opted for the "Tagliatelle alla Bolognese" (pasta ribbons with meat ragu sauce) and boyfriend got the salmon. Unfortunately, both were mediocre. The meat ragu sauce was not very delicious, and the meat was very dry; I ended up scraping off the meat sauce. And the salmon was also bland and dry. I can cook better salmon than this! On the plus side, the roasted potatoes that came with the salmon were tasty, though I can't imagine how anyone can mess that up.For dessert, I got the chocolate mousse, and boyfriend got tiramisu. Both desserts were pretty tasty, though I couldn't finish my mousse because it was a little bit too chocolate-y for me. However, I helped the boyfriend devour the tiramisu. I think you can tell I'm a big fan of tiramisu.In conclusion, only the desserts were tasty, so we shall not return again. If I have to choose between Il Fornaio or Cheesecake Factory, I'd choose Cheesecake Factory, hands down (though I admit, I do love Cheesecake Factory--I'm a fan of their pastas). Oh, and the complimentary bruschetta was actually pretty good. So if you must dine here, at least get the bruschetta and the tiramisu. Holy delicious foods, Batman!We went to this place before checking out A Christmas Carol at the 5th Avenue Theatre. There were 6 of us, so we all got to sample each other's dishes. The seasonal mushroom risotto was probably the best. The seasonal mahi mahi was the worst - too much tomato sauce and not enough real flavor.. and the fish was overcooked. :( One should NEVER overcook fish! The canneloni was also delicious. The wine list is to die for.The service was impeccable - I really couldn't ask for better. Their challah bread is ridiculously good. I probably ate way too much of it. The tiramisu was phenomenal, as was the zabaglioni, and the gelati. How often can you really go wrong with dessert?It's spendy, for certain, but it's honestly not that much more than a junky food place like Red Robin.I've never been to the cafe in the middle of the mall, but that'll be next on my list, as well as the Happy Hour. I came here for lunch today, but I wish we had come later for dinner instead. The entrees were big, and it felt too early in the day to be eating such heavy foods. But anyway....The bread was delicious. Il Fornaio takes its bread seriously. After all, it is a bakery after all! It was sweet and fresh and soft on the inside, chewy on the outside. I wish they served it with olive spread as well as olive oil/vinegar, though. It would have been amazing, I'm sure.We got a grilled seafood sampler-thing with parsley sauce to start. It was alright. Seemed like it was almost a little bit undercooked, which was worrisome. I felt like the parsley sauce was meant to be the oomph of the dish, but maybe if it had a tinge of spiciness it would have added more actual oomph instead of just falling at average.I ordered the lasagna, and it was huge. I wouldn't have been able to finish it, even for dinner. The taste was good, but nothing surprising or mouthwatering. Just lasagna. I guess as comfort food it'd hit the spot, but it wasn't something I'd want to order at a restaurant. Our orders took a bit longer than usual because of "technical difficulties with [their] printer" so we got a few coupons for free drinks/desserts. We used one on tiramisu :)The tiramisu was creamy and tasty. I'm not sure if they do this everywhere/all the time, but instead of chocolate powder on top of the tiramisu, there were chocolate shavings on top and inside of the cake. Each bite was soft with the lady fingers and cream, with a bit of a crunch because of the chocolate. It was definitely satisfying and I could've eaten the entire thing myself twice over. Overall, I'm not that impressed. Maybe my hopes were too high for some superdelicious Italian, but because my entree was just okay, I'm giving it 3 stars. Wasn't amazing and wouldn't be a top choice if I had an Italian craving. But maybe I'd come back and just get the tiramisu. Came here at lunchtime, and everything was good but not amazing. Service was fine, and we each had one of the risottos. The portion sizes didn't look consistent. I had a very large portion, while one of my companions had a much smaller one. Strange. Service was a tad slow, but we had overheard two servers talking about being short-handed when we walked in. It is possible they weren't talking about that night, but the staff did seem light. Our server did check in often about bread and water, and told us that our food would be coming out. One friend had a pizza, which was HUGE for one person, another had the 4 cheese gnocchi, another had the gnocchi with a tomato-cream-pesto sauce that looked amazing. I had the seafood risotto. I'm not experienced with risotto and I did find it a bit crunchier than I expected. Portions for our three pasta dishes were not huge but were satisfying. I really want to go back for something classic like Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken. Il Fornaio at Pacific Place is divided into three sections. &#160;They have: 1) cafe at the first floor of Pacific Place; 2) non-reservation-able booth area on the lower level; 3) dining room area that accepts reservations, first floor.Calamari, good yummy. &#160;Ahi ... don't order the Ahi. &#160;Dessert, very good.I been to Il Fornaio in the past, always had the lobster ravioli, so thought I try something new. &#160;Alas, the ahi came out to be tasteless lump of fish. &#160;So, don't order the ahi! This review is for the happy hour food. This is an incredible happy hour for the hungry. Their appetizers are $5 (much less than the usual 12 or so) and they do not make the plates smaller for happy hour. I had grilled prawns, scallops, and squid. The quality was excellent. For the hungry and budget minded - what's most impressive about this happy hour aside from generous portions of quality food is the happy hour table full of complimentary bruschetta and small pastries. This may very well be the best happy hour eating spot in Seattle. Starts at 4:30pm Yes, I know. I have eaten at the chain restaurant despite the amazing food offerings downtown. Peer pressure, proximity, whatever is the reason, this ended up being a great choice for several reasons. This said, I will NEVER miss the opportunity to enjoy their Carpaccio- raw slices of beef, with shaved grana cheese, capers and wild arugula drizzled with lemon olive oil. As you take a bite you taste the sweet, gamey, thick flavor of the meat itself, cut with the bitter tang of lemony arugula and capers add the hint of saltiness. These flavors complement each other absolutely perfectly and go to create a party in your mouth; one that you will not soon forget.Endless bread basket is amazing. Four kinds of bread ciabatta, rosemary roll, whole wheat roll and baguette. Calamaretti fritti looked pale and tasted like tasteless pieces of deep fried dough with something chewy inside. And the title and description were so promising, but dish itself major disappointment.Insalata Cesarina with housemade Caesar came with no dressing whatsoever, but enough for me to tell that they are anchovy friendly. However, this is lovely since most of the place overdress the salad so for a change it is nice to see this mistake reversed. Original.Pizza Vegetariana &#160;comes with mozzarella, tomato sauce, sliced artichokes, zucchini, eggplant, sliced tomatoes, mushrooms, fresh basil and it is probably the best veggie pizza I had in a while. Pizza Fradiavola also had mozzarella, tomato sauce, but was loaded with Italian sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers, red onions, spicy peperoncini oil. Careful this is really spicy, 2-3 stars. Great family style place with great cocktails, extensive wine list and fast service; chose a spot closer to the windows to avoid major traffic as hostess brings the new eaters. I am definitely going back to get some Carpaccio, the cheapest food item that evening, but the one that made it all worth it. My work group went to Il Fornaio after working a long week at the Washington State Convention Center. We were looking forward to some comfort food and "drinking to excess."We had made a reservation well in advance of 7:45pm in the private dining room for our group of 11, but we ended up waiting 30 minutes after arrival to get seated. There was a group in the private dining room that would not leave (which is their right), but the restaurant planned that poorly. We waited 30 minutes and were finally seated in the general dining room. I guess it took that long to set up tables even though by that time of night the restaurant was only half full.The waiter did bring some complimentary Bruschetta to make up for the wait, and that was good.The drinking commenced, and based on the state that we all left in, the drinking was good. I had a (couple) double vanilla vodka with diet coke, and the bartender did right by me.Our service was a bit slow at first, but our waiter did put up with me screaming about his pompadour hair style and touching the fake desserts, so I have to give him props.I ordered the lasagna, which was one of the house specialties. The portion was freakin' huge, and since I did not want to soak up all of the glorious alcohol, I only ate about 1/3 of it. It did have a slightly bitter taste, which was explained by the burnt cheese on top. Just meh.Even though my order was just meh, everyone else around me had great food! Since I was slightly drunk, I felt it was OK to eat off all the plates around me. The calamari was fantastic! Not rubbery or chewy at all. The SO had the Conchiglie al Pollo, which was really good and fresh tasting--not overly saucy. My boss has the Butternut Squash Ravioli (I skipped the fancy name this time), which was delicious and creamy. My favorite though was the Pennoni alla Vodka (Penne with Vodka-Tomato sauce). The bacon flavor in this just puts it over the top. Once my co-worker was done eating, I finished it off for him.We then finished with the dessert sampler (Dolce Trio) for the table (this is after I manhandled the dessert tray). The gelato was very good, but everything else was just average. Since I was in the mood to drink my calories rather than eat them (that is a rarity for me!), I didn't chow down here. The desserts were very light, but not necessarily in a good way...maybe in a kind of bland way. One of my co-workers wanted a brownie, and our waiter brought some fudge-like thing that was not on the menu. Now THAT was good.We ordered a round of Limoncello, since most of us had never tried it before. It was way too intense for me, kind of like lemon Pledge cleaner. Others liked it, so I'm sure that was a personal taste thing.Our group closed down the place, and we had a great time. Ok, so we went here for restaurant week. &#160;The service was good, replete with silverware replacement and other such pretentious nonsense.However, I need good food. &#160;Here's a breakdown of what we had:The caprese was very standard. &#160;Cheese tasted a bit processed, but there was basil, tomato, blah blah. &#160;I've had worse.The calamari was lightly breaded with no seasoning. &#160;It was tender, but so bland I didn't care. &#160;I had to overpower it with the spicy marinara they gave me to dip, but that was pretty one note too.The anti-highlight was my girlfriend's bolognese; I could tell the ingredients were of better quality than canned pasta, but the flavor profile was the same. &#160;At least the pasta was cooked well.My salmon was juicy and the potatoes that came with it were nice. &#160;Probably the best part of the meal, but there wasn't anything distinct about it. &#160;Give me a QFC, 30 seconds and a 10 foot radius of room to work with, and then I've gathered the ingredients.The tiramisu was good. &#160;The mousse was good, but the lemon flavor in the cake at the bottom gave it this weird, almost metallic taste.I'm being kind of nitpicky, but the point I'm trying to make is that a place that puts on the kind of air it does, and charges the kind of prices it does, can do better with its food. &#160;If you make your bottom line more about net revenue, I'll go somewhere better, somewhere privately owned where the food is constantly being reinvented and improved. &#160;I guess I shouldn't have been so surprised, given that it's a chain. &#160;But that bolognese was terrible. &#160;No excuses! This review is based on the Risotteria section of the restaurant. I'm choosing to slightly ignore the Main Restaurant because my rating would be much lower if I include it. I was enjoying the Risotteria section so much that I decided to try the main, fancier, restaurant for a change. Expecting a really good meal, I was flabbergasted at how much I disliked the meal I ordered. I had some kind of fish ravioli, with flavors and ingredients that did not mix well at all. It was like a traffic jam of flavors. The plate quickly became challenge for me to eat, so I walked away disappointed. As much as I disliked the main restaurant though, I adore the Risotteria. I must have stopped by there at least twice a week during my recent 2 month stay in Seattle. I liked every single Risotto I had, always looking forward to what Risotto was on special for the day, or trying again one of the excellent Risottos on the regular menu. A risotto is a simple yet just about perfect meal to me, with its creamy and starchy versatility. The ones done right are among the top of foods I crave the most. Il Fornaio does it right. When we have FREE movies at Pacific Place. I usually set a meet up here for Happy Hour. How can anyone say NO for FREE appetizers. Jerky Chicken, Mini Pizzas, Bruchetas, Pasta, crab cakes. everyday is different. Buy a drink and fill a plate. Micro Brews $3 or glasses of Wine for $4. &#160;Come with a group and fill multiple plates. &#160;It fills up fast so come early. &#160;If we have another preview movie come join us ..We will be there.
Out of times that I've been there the place is usually empty or theres not many people in there. The place is alright, the staff is nice, and the food is okay. I've had better alfredo at other places, it just tasted kind of dull. Their breadsticks are only okay. Their chicken parmesean is good.
We love this place! We eat like pigs, but it's such good food that we don't feel stuffed and bloated! My 7-year-old niece said she gives it 12 out of 5 stars. And my friend and sister, who both LOVE 5 Guys, say Burgermaster is better than 5 Guys! Burgermaster is the best burger in town, and the staff is always very friendly. Just visited the North Seattle Aurora location today. The "burgermaster" burger (w/ no cheese) was fantastic and with their locally purchased beef, always makes their burgers stand on their own. Service is fast and friendly and I look forward to going back again soon. Eat up. P.S. Their french fry's are legendary! Me and the missus go here about once a week, park, throw up our headlights and wait for the car hop to come out. I cannot get past just ordering a burger, fries and shake because it is always the same amount of incredible each time that I'm NEVER wanting to mix up my order one bit.The food quality is always at a high standard, fresh and cooked right. If you know the difference between good meat and standard you know on your first bite that what they use is top of the line. Staff is friendly and always willing to do the extra requests (wife will not drink a shake you can't skate on first, and they understand). When I want a real burger there's not one place I can think of that even comes close to this joint. Grilled Cheese sandwiches dipped in Tartar Sauce. &#160;I know it sounds gross, but I love it! &#160;The fries are great too-especially dipped in more Tartar sauce! &#160;Been going to this location for 30+ years and it's always great. I've also been to the Bellevue location.
I used to really love Bento sushi. &#160;It's not expensive, the fish was fresh, close to home, fast take out. &#160;My go-to take out sushi place. &#160;But I'm downgrading my 4 stars to 3, because of the following:- the sashimi smells a little too much like fish. &#160;If it's fresh, it should smell like nothing or just slightly sweet- they routinely forget at least one thing from our order- they do not have horenso (spinach salad which I LOVE)I will still probably get my sushi there, because there's not really a better option in Ballard (there's Sam's, but it's too expensive for being just slightly better in quality). &#160;So I hope you'll all come eat there when I open a sushi place in my 'hood since we clearly need a good one! &#160;Horenso for all! Overall, I love Bento Sushi, as the food has always been tasty and affordable, and it's close to home.However, the last time I went there, I was a little disappointed. It was the middle of the week, and early-ish - in other words, not a time that should have been super busy for my order to get as screwed up as it did. I ordered several items, including gyoza, tempura and sushi, among other things. Yes, it was a large order, but not outrageous.When I got there a few minutes after the amount of time I'd been told it would take had passed, i waited as the girls behind the counter kind of frantically tried to put it together. When it was all ready, i had no reason to think anything was amiss, as there were plenty of containers.Upon arriving home, I first discovered two containers of tempura, rather than just one. Both orders had lots of veggies, but only 3 shrimp between them, even though I had asked for a dinner order of shrimp tempura. Then I realized that there was no sushi at all, which is when I called. They had realized their error, and told me to come back for the sushi. I asked them if I should bring the extra tempura back, and they said no, understandably. When I got there, I asked them about the lack of shrimp in the tempura, and they said they gave me an appetizer order not a dinner, and only charged me for that, not the dinner. I explained that I asked for the dinner, and I didn't mind paying, but I really wanted the shrimp (it was for someone else, he asked for shrimp). They kind of argues it, but then agreed to get it for me, as they should have, as I offered to pay. I had to wait several minutes for it to be prepared. They didn't charge me, so all in all, I got everything I ordered and more, but it was pretty inconvenient.This is the first time I've had a problem, hopefully it will be the last, and I can give them more stars, as I would have before!
Kona Kitchen has become my go-to Seattle spot for 808 comfort food. &#160;I'm from Hawai'i, so I'm sorry if this comes off as snobby. &#160;First, the menu! KK has a HUGE menu of awesome food including all 808 fan favorites and other stuff for the uninitiated. Among the fan favorites, the portuguese sausage breakfast is standard (good but hard to screw up), the fried rice loco moco is solid, and the kimchi fried rice with eggs is killer. &#160;I also highly recommend the sweet bread french toast, but holy crap, watch your blood sugar. &#160;Unfortunately, their corned beef hash is from the can, so nothing special to speak of there. &#160;(TIP: You guys should totally come up with an original recipe for a HI favorite like this.) &#160;Second, the service. &#160;Great service. &#160;This place gets busy (for good reason), so sometimes, it takes a minute to flag someone down. &#160;Still, without exception, every server I've met there has been friendly and polite. &#160;When he's around, the owner Yuji sometimes come's out and chats with customers too. &#160;They also occasionally have live ukulele music, which is nice. &#160;So thumbs up there. &#160;Third, the atmosphere. &#160;In my experience, island peoples are obsessed with authenticity. &#160;Everyone wants to know who's "actually from Hawai'i" etc. &#160;The owner has Hawai'i roots, and many of the staff and clientele are from Hawai'i. &#160;In fact, I run into people I know half the time I go. &#160;So it gets my stamp of approval there. &#160;I gotta deduct a couple of points for the bit of touristy kitsch, though (ABC Store mugs, e.g.). &#160;I realize a theme is important for business, but it's not my style. &#160;Kaua'i Family Restaurant gets my top score for authentic 808 atmosphere in the 206. &#160;There, I actually feel like I'm in someone's house on a neighbor island. &#160;Last: value. &#160;The portion sizes are gigantic and you pay for it. &#160;A breakfast entree and a coffee will run you $16+ after tax and tip. &#160;I'd be satisfied with a smaller portion for a little less. &#160;Overall, Kona Kitchen is awesome. &#160;Mahalo and keep up the good work, Yuji. Can you keep a secret?...me either. That's why I have to tell you about Kona Kitchen! It's my favorite Hawaiian joint in Seattle. Its unassuming exterior boasts nothing of how incredibly yummy their food is...tender Kalua Pork, tasty Mac Salad, value-friendly lunch specials, all day breakfasts, crunchy Mochiko Chicken, juicy Huli Chicken, flavorful Kalbi...even the meatloaf is good! I've been making my way through their menu, and I have to say that nothing has disappointed me yet. However imho, the crowning glory of this humble place has to be their FRIED RICE LOCO MOCO! It's so freaking good...there are no words...just go try it!And if you're a fanboy/fangirl, the owner of this joint is Yuji Okumoto. ;)http://www.imdb.com/name&#8230; So I've come here a few times now and every time I go, I enjoy the food and experience even more. The huli chicken is my current fave, it's 2 large bone in chicken breast. Its flavorful, hearty, and always moist. I've also tried the spam fried rice which is quite addicting. The loco moco is also good, you can get it over fried rice (do it). The mochiko chicken is sooooo tasty. Another plus is that they are great at accomodating large parties. &#160;You pay at the front which makes it easy to split bills. Service is always great. To be honest, Hawaiian food isn't my favorite.But what made this night interesting was that the waitress got every single one of our orders wrong, but bolted before we even got our incorrect orders.It's a relatively casual restaurant with friendly service. Decent food. That's about it. Had dinner here and we ordered spam musubi, loco moco (on the breakfast menu under classics) &amp; mochiko chicken with the mac salad as our side. The mac salad was a tad bit on the salty side and grainy. Loved the sauce on the spam musubi. The mochiko chicken was just fried chicken. I was expecting something similar to Hawaii BBQ in the U-district's which is really crispy &amp; seasoned well. Loco Moco gravy was really buttery and heavy. The food was pretty good and portions are plentiful! We had a lot of leftovers so I recommend sharing. &#160;Service was excellent! We were seated right as we walked in, given our ice waters and they came back a few times to check up on us. Kona Kitchen is pretty far out there for someone coming from downtown Seattle, but would stop by if I'm headed to Greenlake. Came here cause I was craving Hawaiian food n I heard this place could ease my hunger. Side note, I never really craved Hawaiian food when I lived in Hawaii for pretty much all my life but now that I'm not there I crave it more n more. Anyways back to the review, I ordered the Hawaiian plate which consists of pork laulau, kalua pig n cabbage, lomi lomi salmon, Mac salad, n 2 scoops of rice (only available Sunday-Thursday). This meal brought me right back home with the fat in the laulau n the salty kalua pig....mmm mmm good!!! Gave this place 4 stars only cause they don't serve poi...WTH?!?!?! Other than that this place is pretty legit on serving authentic Hawaiian food, my other half said her loco moco was bomb too but I didn't eat any....definitely coming back to try some of their lunch specials. Arrived on a Saturday afternoon after golf, so in the middle of the lunch and dinner crush. Service is prompt and friendly, but the food was not all that grand. &#160; The order probably hit the kitchen 2 minutes after 4:00, so I missed out on the spring roll that comes with the lunch plates. &#160;The Waimea Plate comes with one piece of katsu and a small pile of overdone beef. Kind of orange tinged (the carrots??) mac salad and two scoops rice. &#160;Either I wasn't that hungry or it wasn't that great since I normally would have wolfed the entire plate. Friend got the Korean Chicken, which were little nubbins deep fried and dressed with a spicy sauce. Meh. Made me think of Aiea Bowl's Tasty Chicken, in a miniature version. &#160;Since she had more money to spend from a gift certificate, she wanted to try the fried rice. No such luck on an a la carte order, she had to order from the breakfast menu and skip the eggs. &#160;It was good and homey, but had that special "restaurant mouth feel." &#160;MSG? Tough to compare to joints over in the 808, but if you are headed out to the Lake City area, stop here, though you gotta make an illegal left turn out of the express lanes... Love the island vibe. We moved and we miss the kona family. If you really enjoy Hawaiian style food this is the place to come!! &#160;I have yet to try anything I didn't really enjoy! &#160;Killer Loco Moco and other Island favorites!! &#160;Great breakfast as well. &#160;Good food and good prices! Had the Konack Attack for lunch. It's a great way to get a sample of almost everything they offer on one plate. Delicious! Love this place! My Boyfriend lives only blocks away and it has definitely become our go to spot! Delicious food and wonderful people working there! I love the Hawaiian French Toast! Highly recommend!! I have been there 6-7 times over the years and have always had good service. &#160;You will not pick up a date there, but a great place to go with friends for a low key night. &#160;I usually go there with a very large crowd. &#160;The food is pretty good. &#160;It is not that expensive either. Kona kitchen has some of the best food! The staff is amazing. I've been coming here for years now and the food is always great. It's true comfort food. Their loco moco is actually alot more enjoyable than on the islands. Hawaiian fried rice is a must try! The only downside? This place is becoming more and more popular by the day. Friday-Sunday are some of the busiest time of the week. But it is worth the wait. Trust. Perfect pseudo-Hawaiian feel, without being tacky. Simple, no-frills comfort food is all it is and they do it very well! Great place for Hawaiian food! Their best dish is the loco moco fried rice, which I order every time I go. The wait staff is friendly and they are pretty efficient at preparing the food. I've never had to wait too long for my food to arrive.
Even 10 hours later, I am still undecided on this place... looking at the logo/signage/website, I expected a pretty classy spot - but what I found was a muddle of an old Outback steakhouse and sleazy Belltown club. There was nothing really authentic or chic about it - as I had imagined.Pros:Good food (even for a "soft opening" and incomplete menu).Service was rocket fast.If you score a table by the [what they call "patio" - but is actually] open window upstairs, that is nice.Cons:You are still inside an old Outback Steakhouse, I feel like they updated some things - or rather, they added some elements, but there is still an obvious Outback floor/carpet/tables, etc... maybe even staff?Beer and wine selection was really "meh" - you might find better options at an Outback ;)At approximately 8pm, the restaurant area turned into a club... the music was turned WAY up, and people stopped sitting in their tables and just started milling around drinking cheap beer. Weird. All in all, I still have 3-4 Mexican restaurants that I like MUCH more in Seattle... so, I will only be back if I am in the area, and maybe not even then... They still need to get their stuff together. The decor is good, it's a two story building with one bar downstairs and one bar upstairs. Great view of the lake from upstairs.The good: The food is decent. The burritos are huge, you might want to share. BF liked his carnitas tacos a lot.Lots of open spacefull barseveral tv's for sports, etc.outdoor patio downstairsThe bad:the location SUCKS. between limited parking and construction, you're better off walking.There's only one set of bathrooms and they're downstairs. Bring your sunglasses, because that bathroom is like a white, bright ass operating room compared to the darkness of the actual restaurant, with none of the character of the restaurant. It's as if they ran out of money and said "fk it".Service is "ok". Instead of taking care of the patrons, several of the servers and bartenders sat there and chatted with each other. The bartender was nice though.I'd go back, I do want to try the tacos, but I'll wait until they get into their grand opening.Some Victoria Mexican beer would be nice too :) I've been to Trago twice since their soft opening &amp; I'm very happy to placate their egos &amp; state that I was far from dissapointed. &#160;This is a nice addition to the options available on Lake Union &amp; offers a great view, cool breeze, tasty food &amp; comfortable atmosphere.My first visit was during their soft grand opening. &#160;When you first walk in it is somewhat confusing on where you're suppose to go. &#160;At first glance the place looks empty but as soon as the hostess came back down she directed us upstairs where you quickly discover that's the place to be for the evening. &#160;The patio windows were open given a nice view of Lake Union &amp; a very comfortable breeze which as the crowds gathered &amp; booze started flowing was an extremely welcoming change to most. &#160;The bartenders looked a little overwhelmed during the first night by my second visit last week showed a terrific improvement. &#160;The music was solid &amp; the atmosphere was fun. &#160;There were multiple places to sit down, chill out &amp; have a normal tone-of-voice conversation without having to compete with the DJ. &#160;Our entire group had a great time.My Second visit was for their recent Taco Tuesday. &#160;Again...all the positive statements above still apply but many of the shortcomings they had from their first week had been solved or had made huge progress. &#160;The place looked more complete, staffed seemed a little more at ease &amp; everything seemed to run like a well oiled machine. &#160;The tacos were awesome!! &#160;Very tasty, good flavor, right size &amp; the price was perfect; $2 a taco, I think. &#160;The carne asada was a little dry but the sauce that came with it compinsated. &#160;Our server was very attentive &amp; we never went long for a refill on our drinks or offers for more food. If you use Facebook then you should like their page as they constantly advertise specials for the night, like the Taco Tuesday, Sounder Ticket giveaways for any buying Coronas, special on beer buckets, etc.They serve food until 1am which is a plus.They have salsa dancing downstairs on the weekend.This will be a premier spot &amp; once the construction around the area is finished parking will no longer be an issue to those struggling to find it. &#160;I personally never had a parking issue &amp; was able to find street parking within 30 seconds of getting there. &#160;I'm sure as the days &amp; weeks pass you'll see awesome updates to the lounge, better asthetics &amp; any of the new business kinks will be completely worked out. &#160;Definitely go check this place out, bring your friends, try the tacos &amp; have a good time. &#160;If you feel pissy about anything order a couple shots &amp; dance it off by the window. &#160;That'll help This place is OK. The outdoor view/patio area is an A+ type eating environment for Mexican food on a sunny day. The service is OK. Maybe a tad slow, but no biggie. The food came out fast and was slightly above average.I had the Al Pastor, which I have at most Mexican joints. The pork was pretty good, although a few 'fat' pieces in there. Pineapple was OK, but would've preferred more juicy/fresh. Rice and beans were average. Margaritas were pretty good, but that aint a tall order.These guys may be on their way to something special. But not quite there yet. Overall good food, it's a nice place to go right now for lunch as the outdoorish patio seating is a nice touch. &#160;As far as lunch prices go it's a bit pricey, it appears the same menu is used for both lunch and dinner which means the prices are the same. &#160;Our server was very nice, the hostess was very nice, and the atmosphere was very nice. &#160;Food was good, but it was also what I'd expect. &#160;The carnitas were not crispy, but the flavor for both them and the carne asada were pretty good. &#160;I thought the salsa was above par. &#160;I would prefer a menu item with some protein and vegetables that I could order for lunch that wouldn't cost $18-$20. &#160;As far as places to eat around Dexter avenue goes, this will be one of the places to venture to. &#160;I will have to check out their $2 taco Tuesdays, and hopefully they put a few cheaper items on the menu for lunch. Service was great. $2 taco Tuesday is an amazing deal. Atmosphere was happy and the upstairs was fantastic on a sunny day with the whole wall open, facing the park. Service was fast and friendly, music was nice. What a great spot for happy hour. Just what South Lake Union needed!Great food, strong drinks and a beautiful view of Lake Union.The setup is great and the open air bar is amazing. It's a great way to enjoy the weather without baking in the sun. Even though it was packed on the 4th of July the staff were on point and never left me hanging.Definitely coming back again! &#160;(Also... I hear they have a late night happy hour. Going to check that out for sure.) Awesome downtown location near Lake Union. &#160;If you go, make sure to go upstairs during the summer with the open air dance floor. &#160;Great view out to the water with a good dj and stiff drinks.Our server was Denise, she did an excellent job and made sure we all had an amazing time. &#160;I'll be back again for sure, highly recommend it! I came here with my boyfriend and his parents.Since we live walking distance from this place we had to come try it, but I was really disappointed. I understand that this was a SOFT opening, but even still, this felt like an EXTREME soft opening or something.We came in and sat upstairs in a booth. The decor is really nice, a little upscale feeling (imo). It seemed a little busy, there was our group of 4 and at least 3 more families? It seemed that there was only 1 waitress and 1 bartender working.Our waitress was civil. Not nice, not mean, just blah.For drinks my boyfriend's dad ordered a Del Sol and I ordered a margarita. The waitress carded me which is fine, but at the end of dinner I never got my margarita. (Couldn't the bartender bring me my drink since he wasn't doing anything?)We ordered 3 appetizers, (the prawn ceviche, beef quesadilla, and chicken tacos), chile verde, and the grilled asada.First problem here is that our food did not come out hot. When I come to a Mexican restaurant I usually except the plates to be super hot and the food to be hot. But when all the food came out it was just warm.The prawn ceviche and beef quesadilla were good, but everything else was just bad. All the meat was really dry and didn't have any flavor.I'm hoping to come back again in a couple of months after they have got everything together. Hopefully this was just a fluke and this place will be better. I went here for Taco Tuesday's! It was exciting to go, and the view is great since it's right next to South Lake Union. The wait staff is okay. The host was training a hostess, but aside from that, he was great. Our waitress admitted to forgetting a refill of our chips and salsa... I thought that was interesting. But she was okay overall.I ordered the 'Macarena' drink which was disgusting. It was super bitter and tasted like lime skins and vodka. It did not taste like how the drink was described, and it wasn't even sweet. It tasted just like bitter melon with orange juice. UGH. A waste of money. Plus, when I asked for it to be re-made, all the bartender did was give this face like "OMG, I have to remake it?" and the waitress took it in the back and put water in it. SMH.The tacos were good, but not great. It was rather dry, and real tacos, authentic tacos is filled with salsa and guacamole, which there wasn't much of. I thought it was just okay. For $2 though, it's a good deal. I just had the carne asada... but i heard the other ones tasted better. I MIGHT give it another try.I also had their ceviche. It was definitely good, not authentic as Mexico, but it was definitely an 8/10, but I just love ceviche anyway, so i could be biased.Overall, I liked the host better than the wait staff. but it's a nice quiet place when I went for HH. Maybe I'll give them a second chance, we'll see. I like this place. &#160;Does that make me a douche? &#160;Perhaps.The food is pretty good (although the fries were soggy). &#160;Good service. &#160;Fun menu.The atmosphere is loud and hip-hoppy, so prepare yourself for that. I really like this place. I am always a little shocked when I go there and it's not packed. The food is great and not overprice and the Owner Sean is a great guy and provides outstanding service.I always love it when I find a place I like that people don't know about, but I want this place to be successful and stick around - so check it out.By the way, the jalapeno rellenos are killer - spicy and tasty.They are now doing comedy on Wednesday nights. I can't wait to check it out. Verdict: Go there. Now. We live around the corner and are happy to have a mexican place to walk to. Went our first taco tuesday last night and it was great. I was amanzed that they had about 5-6 kinds of tacos to choose from. Good place to go also, if you want to watch a sports game in the background. We usually eat and drink at the bar and enjoy the bar tender's service. So far I think it's better than the floor staff. Glad Trago is in the neighborhood and look forward to them getting more and more popular and more and more polished. Exceptional staff! Over achieving service! This crew made the night special - YOU GUYS ROCK!!! Calling a truce with the owner .........some things in life are truly free. Went here the other night with my dragon-boat team after practice. We practice right near Kenmore Air so we just walked over, no parking issues. &#160;We were seated right near the huge open window on the patio upstairs. Awesome view of the lake we just finished working out on! &#160;The service was good, although they forgot one of our orders so we were all eating before our last person finally received his meal. But the waitress was very apologetic and didn't charge him for it. Also, at first she said she couldn't split the bill up for parties over six, but when we grumbled about that she said she would. I get that it can be a pain for waitresses to ring up all the bills separately, but it's really much easier for large groups where everyone's paying their own so I'm glad she changed her mind. Good call on her part.As for the food, I loved my nachos. The chips were home-made, not out of a bag, and you could tell. Yum! Everyone else at my table got something different and everyone said it was good. Not great, but not bad. Just good.I'll definitely be back as I sometimes crave nachos after a hard workout on the lake! We might be back tomorrow night if enough people want to go after practice. Great new Mexican place and it right down the street. &#160;I may even take the boat down to eat here. &#160;They have a great happy hour and the margaritas are tasty. My friends and I went on a Saturday around 7:30 surprisingly not busy. We were sat upstairs as downstairs was a ghost town. Service was decent, there was a new girl training but all and all not bad. We ordered the garlic shrimp, tortilla soup, house salad, chicken dish with lime and I think chipoltle and a mondo burrito. Everything was very flavorful even the chips and salsa. The drinks we got were some house drink ice tea vodka that weren't good. It's got a romantic setting, nice for date night. I'll be back. OK. &#160;Tuesday taco night, therefore low prices on tacos. &#160;They were good, not spectacular. &#160;Chips were mediocre. Service was good. Music, reggae too loud. Really more of a bar with food. Have been to Trago a few times now in the old Outback in South Lake. &#160;It is a large space and they have done a great job with the ambience and decor. &#160;The service was pretty good and the food was pretty good as well. &#160;It is not going to blow you away and probably a step down from Barrio or Poquitos, but the prices compare and it is less expensive.Definitely worth checking out. First star for the location, I love how the SLU area is changing and Trago is a good addition. Second star for the great prices on happy hour beers! I was shocked and pleased when I received my tab. Third star for the facility itself, the open air patio is SWEET!I have to say that (as much as it doesn't matter) I was disappointed that a new Seattle restaurant misspelled "Macrina" and "Rainier" on their menu/happy hour menu. Local favorites deserve a new spot's respect!I'm reserving my last star for when I come in and try the food and experience the service. My review could easily be 4 stars by this time next week!Thanks! I was happy with our visit for Happy Hour. $2 tall boys and $2 off draft beers, I was a happy girl. Their menu was great too, chicken tacos, nachos, quesadillas and ceviche at very reasonable prices between $4 and $7 at good size Happy Hour dishes. I really enjoyed having chips and salsa at our tables as well. It was not very busy, but a beautiful evening where we sat upstairs with the windows open to Lake Union. The service was excellent. We met the manager who was very accommodating. Overall, food, service and view was excellent. I will definitely be returning with my friends! Eh...very so so Mexican cuisine. The ambiance and food is very average ala Outback Steakhouse which it replaced at this location. I came here again with a party of 6 for lunch on a Friday. Everyone was very pleased with their meal. I had the carne asada torta (a steak sandwitch) with a side of dark shoestring fries. The co-owners were very friendly. If you ever have a problem, they will go out of their way to fix it for you. Went to this place last weekend with my fiance after walking along Lake Union and enjoying the new park. We stumbled in and, like other reviewers, took a few minutes to realize we needed to head upstairs in order to get service. We ordered tacos and a torta, both of which came out quickly and were well prepared. Our waitress did forget my beer, but when reminded quickly apologized and brought it out. The window was open and it was a perfect relaxing afternoon setting. One of the owners came out to speak to us about potentially having our Rehearsal Dinner for our upcoming October wedding at their venue. They were very accomodating when discussing food and bar menu and times for that evening. Although they are still in their "soft opening," they seemed confident in their ability to host a large group and understood the requirements that go along with wedding weekend festivities! Great food, great location, and very accomodating service. They are still learning, but they were open to suggestions and put our needs first.
It wouldn't be Christmas, Easter, Birthdays or random Saturday mornings without them in our Danish heritage family. &#160;From their Benaroya Hall location days to the present Queen Ann shop, they are the pastry and cakes of choice for my whole family. &#160;We stray every now and then into cupcake land, but always come back, sorry that we even thought about straying.The saddest face in the whole family belongs to the one who misses out on a snitter. &#160;Sure, an apricot danish will more than make up for it, usually. &#160; I crave their marzipan laced goodies.Lost a star only because every year there is a mix up with our holiday order. &#160;Every year. &#160;A strange and anxious part of the whole season. &#160;We've learned to go very early on Christmas Eve just in case we have to back-fill from the case...with eclairs... Loved this place! I went here thinking I might be able to pick up a sandwich too, but I would say this place is mostly about the pastries and desserts. Everything was delicious though! The 'potato' looked kinda weird, but it was soft, creamy, and scrumptious. It's dangerous to walk in here if you're me... I ended up ordering about one of everything to take home... but man, that was a good night. Wow. &#160;Perhaps my new favorite bakery. &#160;We bought a few kinds, I can't remember all of their names. &#160;There was a snitter, a Napolean hat, potato, and a few others. &#160;The snitter was the best, but they were all great. &#160;Wish I had brought some home! So, in support of "The Little Guys", I headed to Seattle to spend the day shopping for cheeses, breads and pastries for the hosting of our annual celebration of Festivus with some friends. Nielsen's Authentic Danish Pastry was the first stop of the day. I had never been here before but thanks to my fellow Yelper's, it was an easy decision to start the day off right with Nielsen's. The bakery is located off the main drag, but was easy to spot due to the foot traffic coming and going. I walked up to the crowded display cases and was mesmerized by the nice variety of delicious-looking goodies. After my quick scan, I ordered a snitter and an apple Danish and a 12 oz. latte. We shared the snitter and the Danish at one of the tables. Both were over the top good. The people next to us had the potato and were in awe of it. Naturally, we had to order two to go, as well as another snitter (Seattle is a ways off after all). When I got back to the car, I marked the location in my GPS, cuz Baby, I'm comin' back! The next morning over coffee, the potatoes and the snitter we brought home became history. OMG they were good! I'm trying to think of an excuse right now on why I need to drive 35 miles north to Seattle. Napolean hat = heaven....it is so so so good. I go just for that. The staff is sweet and the treats are too. I love the laid back casual atmosphere. Coffee drinks are decent as well.
I should bring my "Oompa"-Tuba and wear my liederhosen when I come here, that's how authentic it is, OH YUM!SITREPThe only reason I would ever feel bad for Kaffeeklatsch is because they don't get the attention they deserve from Seattle peeps further down on the various "Hill-Grids". &#160;[But the only reason why Kaffeeklatsch probably doesn't complain is because they don't want hipster riff-raff coming here anyways!] &#160;;^DIt's hard to believe it's already been a year since Kaffeeklatsch opened their doors in the Lake City community, but as of January 2012, it's official, and what an incredible addition to the community this place has been.SETUPAnd what a delightful find one day while wandering around the streets of Lake City. &#160;And I was LOST! &#160;Had to call my mom! &#160;(Don't laugh! &#160;I'm serious! &#160;The embarrassing call went something like this, "Mom - thanks for calling back this number. &#160;Yes, I know it's not my number. &#160;It's the number of the nice lady here in this coffee shop who let me use her phone because my iPhone is dead and that's why I had to leave you a voicemail to call her phone. &#160;I need you to come get me....in a bit.......maybe an hour....or two.....or so...")Anyways, the coffee shop is Kaffeeklatsch (and the "nice lady" is my new friend Patricia), and what a treat to be introduced into the wondrous tastes, the incredible smells and the eye-popping color of Kaffeeklatsch.THE "GRIND" OF THE BUSINESS DAYI love how Kaffeeklatsch features the work of local, regional artisans and their coffee now is True North Coffee Roasters and it's worth applauding Annette and her staff for giving us the best opportunities of exploring some bold new coffee directions.THE SANDWICHESThese are outstanding and totally reasonable at $6 a pop. &#160;I have become a big fan of both their Caprese Focaccia and their Turkey &amp; Provoline. &#160;Hearty and very filling lunch-treats if you ask me.PASTRIES!!!But the pastries are what keep me coming back! &#160;Have you tried their Blechkruchen? &#160;The Blondie? &#160;The Lemon Poppy Loaf?Yum!Yum!And TRIPLE-YUM!The German bakery here is outstanding in it's output in both terms of variety - from sweets, breads, cakes, etc. - to the sheer volume. &#160;Believe it or not, people just come here to buy STUFF and take it away! &#160;Really!But seriously, Kaffeeklatsch has become a Lake City community focal point and abundently clear why this is so if you've gotten their French Press, a Greek Yogurt, Br&#246;tchen, or any of the many items I've mentioned or missed mentioning.THE LOWDOWNA Bakery OF Bakeries! &#160;A &#160;Coffee House OF Coffee Houses! &#160;This is how they are done right! Of the bakeries around Seattle, Kaffeeklatsch is the one that I find the most difficult to spell and pronounce correctly. It is pronounced kaf-fee-klatsch BTW. This is a German term for a coffee social gathering place. As such, this establishment offers coffee, but also German baked goods which was the reason for my visit.Kaffeeklatsch represents the only bakery offering German baked goods in Seattle. There are a handful down south, but that means driving all the way to Lakewood at the very least.While there are German baked goods offered, not all of the offerings are of this origin. Cookies, cinnamon rolls and scones are on the menu along with some sandwiches. They share space with German items that I dare not try to spell or pronounce. I decided to pick out German choices specifically. Tried the pretzel ($1.75), a bienenstich ($2.85) and a loaf of hefezopf ($5).The pretzel was soft, but really salty. Did not like it so much. The other two items were much better. The bienenstich is a bar shaped pastry with a vanilla custard filling and almonds on top which is moist and delicious. The hefezopf is a brioche like loaf that is shaped like challah as in braided together. It is great to eat on its own or covered with a favorite jam for breakfast.I like Kaffeeklatsch, but I would like to see a few other German bakery goods on the menu. When I compare it to Vosen's in SLC, I see that there is room to add new things. Particularly in the bread category. Where is the pumpernickel? And adding Berliner donuts could not hurt. This is a coffee place after all.Although I have difficulty pronouncing the name, I am glad to finally see a German bakery in Seattle proper. If you've ever been to a bakery in Germany, particularly southern Germany, you know the smell. It's just different from bakeries anywhere else in the world. This place has it - and a lot of other great stuff. Really great pretzels, or brezeln. The drip coffee is also tasty - perfectly smooth and strong at the same time.The atmosphere is laid back and welcoming - lots of German accents. Great wide open door when it's nice out. Cute little kiddy area.The verdict: We've already spent a lot of time there, and we'll probably be spending a lot more. Few places have the food, coffee, and friendly staff like Kaffeeklatsch. I'm always greeted by name and welcomed even during those busy times. I have not been disappointed with the food. Wow. Amazing bread - bread that can be a meal by itself - it's so good. Sandwiches are also great and easy if you are in a hurry. German baked treats are so good and will remind you of Germany. And, those American baked treats are also fantastic - try the chocolate crinkle cookie! &#160;AND, the coffee is strong and delicious. &#160;Great beans brewed through a French press and oh so good. Keep it up Kaffeeklatsch! Wow, what a great find!Stopped in here because we had seen the tiny door in the back (parking lot behing BECU) and were curious to see what it was. Walked in and I was super suprised, it's a nice space, clean, and is spacious without being huge. This place feels like it should belong on Cap hill or in the U district. Tried out the lemon shortbread, tea cookie, blechkuchen (the almond flavor, there was also poppy and rhubard), and the blondie. DELICIOUS pastries! Nothing was overly sweet, everything was fresh (there's an actual kitchen there), and the blechkuchen and tea cookie were my favorites.Also got an iced vanilla latte (everything is double :-)) and wow! THE COFFEE IS REALLY GOOD! I haven't had coffee like this in quite a while. It was smooth, flavorful, and rich. They carry seattle coffee works coffee. &#160;Awesome coffee, awesome pastries, and they have sandwiches too. I could totally see myself studying here and this is definitely the new go to spot for coffee. Prices were good too ($11 for everything) and the lady was very nice and provided descriptions all the pastries. They are also at the Lake City Thursday farmer's market. It's located on Lake City Way, but if you go through the back door, you forget about the sketchiness of LC way once your inside the nice and clean space. Now that I've been to Kaffeeklatsch once, I'm already eager to return again and again. I want to try one of everything! On my first visit, I had a snickerdoodle and an iced americano, $3.80 all together. The snickerdoodle was perfect: moist, low-crumb, slightly sweet, slightly eggy. By comparison, the iced americano was merely good. There was nothing wrong with it, but it didn't bowl me over. There is only one size for iced drinks: 16 ounces. Even with room, a double-shot americano in a cup that big is going to taste a bit weak, so next time I'll ask for an extra shot. To its credit, however, my americano was very smooth and had a lovely crema on the surface. The use of a compostable plastic cup was a thoughtful idea. I wonder whether they have glasses "for here." Other baked goods I'd like to try: cheesecake, pretzels, marble cake, various cookies. As for the interior of Kaffeeklatsch, I think they're off to a good start. I dig the automatic sliding door and the overall open feeling, though the noise level becomes slightly elevated at times. I had no trouble finding an open table, but there's probably room for even more seating if they got creative. The compost container, garbage container, and bus tubs are conveniently clustered at one end of the bar area. Great food, Strong coffee.All the food they serve is homemade. &#160;They have lots of German bread and pastries - everything I tried was delicious.However, if you like sweet coffee drinks with flavors, this is not the place for you. &#160;Their coffee is strong with very little sweeteners added. Yum! Coffee and tea are hot and delicious, food is just great and homemade German Pastries! Yay! &#160;All their baked goods are made in house! nom nom nom!They need to figure out the seating arrangement to fit more people, but it's still worth it to go and eat their food! We went to &#160;Lake City looking for a watch chain, and the baby fell asleep in the car. I enjoyed 45 minutes of uninterrupted reading in the car and completed our errand when she woke. By that time, we were both ready for a snack.Kaffeeklatsch is directly across the street from another bakery. I chose to stop here because I saw a kid area in the window. Very kid welcoming, nursing friendly. Good toy selection &amp; variety for repeat visits.We had a peanut butter cookie and a delicious drip coffee. I love good drip, and this was tasty. Wonderful! Whee!Seriously, it's a good cafe, roomy, pleasant atmosphere, really sweet people. And it smells good!The food took me by surprise - the Bienenstich was delicious!A little hard to find, but plenty of parking.This is perfect for a little German vibe without going over the top into clich&#233;-land. It's right in the heart of my hood, but I've only been in a couple of times. &#160;Every time I have been in, the service has been friendly and fast, there's been good coffee involved, and I like knowing that all of their baked goods are made in house. &#160;Will definitely be stopping by more. Love this place! &#160;Have been here multiple times (live in the Lake city neighborhood) and always have a good experience. &#160;Reminds me of the German bakeries that we visited on our trip to Germany. &#160;I like the variety of baked goods they have and great coffee. &#160;Try the breakfast sandwiches with the homemade biscuits, one of my favorites. Delicious bakery!!!I'm from LA and it's better than than any in my neighborhood. Sweet courteous friendly staff. &#160;Great take home loaves. Good prices. &#160;they will warm up anything for you if you ask. delicious homemade soup. A truly German experience: excellent breads and pastries, and plenty of Deutsch spoken by servers and customers. Nice place - I wish they were open later in the evening. The baker is a genius. &#160;I've never been disappointed with anything he makes. &#160;The staff is wonderful, too. &#160;Their espresso drinks have improved markedly since getting a new coffee blend, roasted just for them. &#160;It's hard to choose what I love the most there, but the cinnamon rolls are amazing. I was lamenting the lack of local coffee shop hang-outs in our new neighborhood, when we stumbled upon this place. Nice!Delicious sandwiches, good coffee, mellow atmosphere, and friendly baristas. The one thing that almost made this rating a 4 was the rather industrial feel (espresso machine + hard floors + high ceilings = echoooo). But then I tried one of their delectable home-made pastries and a 4 just seemed wrong somehow...We'll definitely be back. Yesterday I was FedExing something next door &#160;to Kaffeeklatsch and was lured in by the smell. What a great find! The coffee was wonderful (not bitter or over roasted or weak) and the baked goods were great and the staff was amiable and outgoing. I probably should not have had that tiny apple pie but it sure was tasty! I'll drop in next time I'm in Lake City for sure. The food is great--the smell reminds me of bakeries in Germany. &#160;The baked goods are authentic, nothing terribly Americanized about it. &#160;Everything we've tried has been very tasty. &#160;We've been nearly weekly since they opened, and have brought friends who have enjoyed it as much as we have.Pros: &#160;Great food, everything is tasty. &#160;The staff are very friendly, speak to us in German and English, and are proud of the food they bake (on-site) and serve. &#160;We like how they are trying to build up the community, something Lake City has needed. &#160;The drip coffee is made with a french press, which tastes much better than just drip coffee any day. &#160;Cons: &#160;The seating is kind of sterile (although the tables themselves are quite nice)--cushions on the chairs (which I think they have now) would be nice, as would a few easy chairs for reading. &#160;It's a large space and kind of hard to work with, but more seating would be nice if possible. &#160;Just make it a bit warmer and inviting--more plants, that sort of thing. &#160;We'd love to see large crowds in here. &#160;A bit more food variety would be nice, but we've always been satisfied with what we've had. &#160;Another con--since everything tastes so good, we're in danger of gaining weight... I am so excited to have a great, walkable coffee house in Lake City. &#160;The pastries are delicious--and unique (the German cheesecake is a favorite)! &#160;I would echo some of the other commenters that the space needs some softening (e.g., couches, area rugs, etc) both to absorb some of the noise and to allow for a more comfortable space to hang out. Great place. The atmosphere is a little on the industrial side, which is not in keeping with the very hospitable staff. Everything is made in-house and very tasty, and the coffee is good 'n' strong, particularly the drip. The pastries are delicious and seasonal, perfectly balancing flavors so they don't just taste like an excuse for a toothache. If I drank coffee more often, it'd be my regular hangout in the 'hood. pretty good, we had two small drinks, a pretzel dog, and a bienenstich. it was $12, more $ than we had expected to pay. pass on the pretzel dog, it's extremely salty. the pastry was delicious though. i like that they make everything in-house, and will return to try some other items. there is a kid play area, the place was packed when we went in on saturday morning. you can park behind the building (there's the main lake city entrance, and the back entrance where you go for bartell's). Loooove this place! My two little boys and I often stop in for a snack. There's a great play area which they enjoy. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. There are a couple highchairs for customers. Our favorite food there are the pretzels. They're perfect. (Hint: If you find them too salty, just rub a bit of the salt off!) The chef is right there cooking and almost always gives the kids a pretzel ring to chew on while they play. Wow. &#160;I got the cinnamon rolls here on a whim one day-- simply amazing. &#160;Just the right combination of crust and doughy goodness. &#160;Comes with this amazing cream cheese-based (I think) frosting on the side. &#160;I don't know what addictive chemicals they infused the frosting with, but I crave the stuff. &#160;Even if you don't live in Lake City, this place is worth the trip for the cinnamon rolls alone! No need to go to Starbucks ever again. &#160;This hidden gem has French press &#160;and house made pastries.The apfeltasche was delicious and they make their own bread and granola. Great atmosphere and convenient parking. &#160;Support your local business and sprechen sie Deutsche! We love this neighborhood place! &#160;Our daughter enjoys the kid's play area and pretends to bake while we enjoy yummy pastries and lattes. &#160;Perfect.
It's been a LONG time since I've been to NYC, so I can't really say how accurate this market is...In terms of being a market though, it's pretty bare. Bare.... but clean.At least it doesn't look like a depressing supermarket that is going out of business, with only one or two things on each shelf.As for their breakfast sandwiches... meh. They're alright, but are kinda lacking for flavor. Also, they're kinda oily...though that could just be the croissant I got.The employees are nice though. :-/More info (SPECIFIC info on individual food items).You can see what items I reviewed there: http://www.nosh.com/rest&#8230;
First impression:The sign outside was hard to see, and the windows were adorned with hand written (heavy black marker) neon colored poster board alerting passer-bys of their gluten free and vegan menu items. We walked inside to find bare concrete floors and only counted a few bar height tables bolted to the floor that looked like they were once part of the supporting structure for this place. It was quite chilly inside, and very quiet.Bang for the buck?The ONLY menu the place has is displayed on a single tv monitor next to it the register (other than online). We ordered a small cheese pizza, a classic cob Saturday pizza, 2 calzones (front window said they were supposed to be 5.99 each), a root beer an Italian soda and 4 iced teas. Keep in mind we went to this place under the impression that it was relatively cheap (one $ rating), the bill came out to $65! Service/food:It took quite some time to get the first pizza, and another long wait between all items that we had ordered which made it impossible for us to eat together. The toppings were fresh, and the crust had a certain quality to it that wasn't very pizza crust like. The flavor was good. The cheese pizza was as you would expect it, except for the excess sauce. The calzones were more like just a plain folded over pizza instead of a pocket, and the toppings were spilling out. The calzone hasn't cooked all the way through, which was made obvious by the cold veggies and non-melted shredded cheese on the inside. The verdict? The pizza wasn't bad, but not worth the wait and the gamble to see if it's properly cooked isn't worth it. Is it kid friendly? No.
Holy cow! You guys serve ice cream cones at your McDonald's!??! In California we have to search long and hard to find the green milkshakes for St. Patty's Day and here you can drive through Mickey D's right by the Space Needle and order a Tillamook ice cream cone!I took a picture of the menu board. Flavors include:--Udderly chocolate--Orgeon strawberry--Wild mountain blackberry--Caramel butter pecan--Mint chocolate chip--Vanilla bean--Coffee almond fudge--Marionberry pieThis is right up there with the spam at the McDonald's in Hawaii. Wild. OH MERCY I LOVE MCDONALDS. Any, and every. This place has on occasion gotten my order wrong, but were really quick to fix it for me. And I guess the reason I give MCDONALDS five stars is..Rufus. Every time my friends and I have gone he has been the funniest, nicest guy ever. He deserves a raise and a promotion. Not to mention I love the nuggets and double cheeseburger, what can I say. I love me some fried foods. At the end of the day its a McDonalds. Lets just get that clear first. With that said, the thing that brings me back to this particular location is the price of their items. It seems to be lower than the other McDonalds in the area. A good amount lower actually. I have normally gotten a quick burger or taken advantage of one of the deals running at that time. As I write this review McDonalds is running a 3 dollar meal deal. At this location the meal is truly under three dollars. At the location on 3rd near pine the same meal costs slighty under 4 dollars. That is a big enough difference for me.
I walk into most establishments with 5 stars. It's a fair and decent place to start. Where it goes it up to the business.After viewing the remake of Hairspray (loved it!) the child and I met with my Mom here for an early Saturday dinner, before seeing Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix for the third time (what! I like that movie). We entered from the street level (Pike &amp; 7th) and the three most immediate employees quickly scurried off to far end of the bar. Uh, okay, there goes one star.We stood for what I felt was too long. In fact the bartender (surrounded by at least 5 other employees) came to seat us. THE BARTENDER! He was very nice, held eye contact and I think I noted a touch of embarrassment, this pleased me.Our first interaction with our server was awkward as she seemed doped on Thorazine. But when we started talking food she came alive. We started with beautiful, delectably creamy lobster bisque that I had a very hard time sharing with my Mom, but I did! And a starter of tender, uber-lightly seared tuna with each little slice edged with black and white sesame seeds. It was a generous portion for a starter (and the price). The child gobbled them all up practically.Speaking of the child she was able to order a small kid's portion of pasta and sauce because this place has a children's menu. I was really surprised. The general appearance seems very anti-children but there it was in black and white, complete with a mini pack of crayons. Leslie M., my mom, had the chicken pot pie and DAMN! It looked and smelled DELISH! It was piping hot the entire time she worked on it. I had the shrimp pomodoro and I was in angel hair pasta heaven. Truly a magnificent dish that I couldn't quite finish (but ate the leftovers around midnight that night). &#160;The quality of the food was really excellent, and once I got over my initial pissiness from being basically and blatantly ignored when we first walked in, it was a good food experience. Now be warned though, it is part of the Sheraton Seattle hotel and a lot of the quests are either staying at the hotel or convention goers to the nearby center = old, cruise-shippy types. So don't be alarmed when you realize you're surrounded by your Great Grandma's gin buddies. Not remarkable. &#160;In a city with so many great choices, this is definitely not a restaurant I will return to or recommend. &#160;There was nothing bad about it, but there wasn't really anything great either. &#160;I really have nothing else to say about it (and I'm typically quite verbose). Daily Grill has locations in other states (mostly in California), but they are brand new to Seattle. Don't get me wrong.... really good food, our waiter Josiah was really attentive.... but Daily Grill still has some big shoes to fill. From the sound of the name, I was expecting more of a casual atmosphere, but Daily Grill is not a burger, soup and sandwich place. It's definitely a steak and chop house. Although they also serve breakfast and lunch, the atmosphere is definitely more upscale than a diner. You can come dressed casually, but the environment makes you feel like you should be wearing a dress shirt and tie. I had the New York strip, my partner had the Rib Eye.... incredibly tender. &#160;Both were some of the best slabs of meat we've eaten (and we think nothing comes close to Metropolitain Grill). &#160;When you dine there, definitely order a side of the Fried Onions... the best!Some other reviews here say that the service was bad... maybe we were lucky, but our service was really good. Josiah was very professional, but not stuffy or overbearing. He made great recommendations; knew the menu; was attentive and responsive.I would definitely go back to Daily Grill, but I would give it another 6 months to a year to work out the kinks. Also, I would be better prepared for a more upscale experience than I originally expected. You could definitely spend a lot of money here. Morning one of my trip to Seattle, and I went for the easy option of breakfast at the hotel - if you're following this trip (and why would you be?), you'd know that I was staying at the Sheraton for a trade show at the convention center.Having only just read the two reviews of the Daily Grill now, it brings to my attention that a) it has only recently opened, and b) it was managing only a paltry 2 star average so far from Yelpers.Well, I'm happy to say that it seems as though some of the kinks have been worked out - at no time did I even guess that it had only recently opened, and the food and service were very good. &#160;As I only had breakfast here (twice) and drinks and appetizers one evening, that's all I can base my review on.The first morning, I opted for the Cobb Omelette, and what a great decision that was - a wonderfully fluffy and light omelette filled with chicken, bacon, avocado, green onions, tomatoes and cheese - absolutely delicious. &#160;I accompanied this with a side of fruit, which was oddly tasteless and bland - I put this down to the breakfast gods punishing me for going with fruit rather than breakfast potatoes.I remedied this mistake the next morning, and accompanied the large portion of breakfast potatoes with chicken sausage and eggs. &#160;The gods were happy, as the potatoes were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and flaky inside. &#160;The eggs were perfectly cooked, and the chicken sausage was very flavorful - my only regret was that they only gave me two small sausages - again, I think it was the gods teaching me yet another lesson, punishing me for going with wimpy chicken sausages rather than the hearty pig entrails option!Drinks and appetizers were very good - this was actually the only bar we visited that served Hendricks gin, which I found quite surprising. &#160;Mmmmm, Hendricks... &#160;But I digress! &#160;The chicken quesadillas were very tasty, and the cheeseburger my colleague ordered was ENORMOUS! &#160;I have to admit that I didn't try the burger as I was a little intimidated by its size, and thought it might have a better chance of eating me.All in all, it seems as though the Daily Grill is heading in the right direction - the service was very friendly, occasionally a little slow, but I was in no rush, so I didn't mind too much. &#160;The last monkey they need to shake off their back is the price-monkey - places like this will always suffer when they charge hotel prices - $15 for sausage and eggs is insane, but sadly, I don't see this monkey going anywhere soon. Today was the rehearsal dinner for this restaurant which will presumably open on June 4th. &#160;Let's hope they get some kinks out before then.As it was a mock dinner there were no cocktails, but I was allowed to fake order one. whoopee. &#160;They also brought empty plates for 'bread.' keep in mind I am not basing my rating on any of this I get the point of the training dinner. &#160;However...Our server was absolute crap. &#160;They have been training for two weeks solid for this. Hiccups I understand, crap, I don't. &#160;We waited forever for our sodas. &#160;Did not get to order entrees until almost finished with the starter course. &#160;Asked for parmesan that never materialized, finally asked a manger and he brought it. &#160;(NOTE: they sprinkle the parmesan on your food for you, slowly, it is really annoying) &#160;The server was not knowledgeable at all. When asked if there was MSG in a dish her response was something to do with animal products. &#160;When asked how the chicken was prepared we were met with a blank stare, and like I said they have (should have) been STUDYING to be a SERVER for 2 weeks. &#160;Apparently the bussers and expediters did not have much to do because sodas were being refilled (others brought rather) with one of two sips gone, all around the dining room.Now a note on food...Not stellar.Had an endive (three endive spears as decoration) salad with spicy pecans and walnut oil vinaigrette. &#160;The nuts were good, I needed lots of parmesan to give it flavor, my friend liked it the way it was though. &#160;good size too.Entree: Chicken Picatta with lemon caper sauce. &#160;Chicken was pretty dry, sauce was fairly good, the mashed potatoes are AWESOME. And I'm so pissed about the broccoli I could spit. &#160;Steamed broccoli but they didn't even cut it into florets, just a half a head of broccoli steamed, no salt, no butter, nothing. &#160;How is that classy enough to sit on an 18.50 plate? Who does that? The pesto was ordinary and the chicken Marsala was dry like the Picatta.One last anecdote:My friend ordered the gazpacho and it came with a basket of crackers. &#160;Now since they did not bring bread, I ate some buttered saltines in place of it. &#160;EVERY person who came by that table after her soup was bussed tried to take my crackers away! Seriously, they must covet these things like gold, sometimes it was the same people! Dude, I'M EATING THE CRACKERS! &#160;ok, I'm better now. &#160;And as I mentioned they were every overzealous about bussing, every course, also extremely annoying.For a free meal it was excellent, I would never spend that amount of money on food this mediocre. But hey, it's a restaraunt in a hotel, (Sheraton) so someone will always be eating there. It's also possible they could improve, but I will never know. After walking through 420 hotel rooms at the attached Sheraton looking for damage, I just wanted a good meal. &#160;I guess it was not to be.We walked into the restaurant to what appeared to be a host stand, where servers were walking by, but no one was around to greet us. &#160;then someone stopped, noticed we looked lost and like we needed to be greeted and said, "oh this aint the hostess stand, you gotta go up there through the bar" &#160;Nice. &#160;So we walked through the bar and up to the front of the restaurant where we were asked if we had reservations in a restaurant that wasn't even a quarter full. &#160;No. &#160;The hostess confirmed with her manager that she could seat us and then took us back to a booth. &#160;Where she chatted us up and planned her upcoming vacation with us. &#160;Lovely cork floors, nice dark wood, but overall a boring interior and inconsistent lighting. &#160;We were sitting underneath a spot light. &#160;Turn that down. &#160;People like mood lighting, it isn't pleasant when your eyebrows cast shadows on the table. &#160;Our server was cute and nice, but she was an obvious rookie. &#160;She had heard such great things about the menu, but she wasn't too knowledgeable. &#160;My dinner companion ordered a mint julep, which sounded refreshing. &#160;What showed up at the table was a glass of bourbon, with a few ice cubes and a big sprig of mint sticking up out of the middle like a christmas tree. &#160;No muddling, no simple syrup. &#160;You do not mess up a drink, that is the first rule of a restaurateur. &#160;Well if your point is to get everyone boozy so they won't taste the food, then good job barkeep. &#160;We ordered bread for the table, actually we were asked if we wanted some. &#160;This should be an automatic. &#160;This place should really lose the frozen darigold butter pats too, how about some soft butter in a little dish or at least unwrap the pats or get a butter press, frozen wrapped pats are just tacky. &#160;Derick ordered the blackberry pork chop which sounded excellent, and I had the grilled herbed chicken breast. &#160;We also ordered the side of mac and cheese to share. &#160;It never came, luckily it wasn't on the bill. &#160;Another thing this restaurant needs to learn is that you do not undercook pork or chicken. &#160;I did not order food poisoning. &#160;Both of our meals were pink in the center. &#160;They were very tasty and juicy, but not cooked all the way through which is bad, bad, bad. &#160;The mashed potatoes with spinach were mashed beyond recognition, super starchy and heavy, like glue. &#160;The grilled vegetables were excellent, but the whole grilled tomato and whole grilled red onion was a little odd.To make up for the bad drink, and the undercooked meat, our very cute, very nice, very rookie (had to ask for a steak knife) server treated us to a complimentary dessert. &#160;We opted for the strawberry shortcake. &#160;Disgusting! &#160;The biscuits were made of salt, dusted with powdered sugar, and swimming in the strawberry soup. &#160;We could not believe that someone thought that saltcake would be a good idea. &#160;Dear Daily Grill, you could be excellent, keep working at it, but you left me with a bad salty taste in my mouth.
So looking around at the menu thinking wow these prices are pretty darn expensive for a pizza pie. But then as I look over at a neighbor's food, the best choice is to pay per slice. so I got the garlicy pizza, with peppers, and chicken! Nina likey :) nina weelllyyy wellllyy likey!!!! Now I can understand why they charge so much for a pizza pie, it probably is as big as my little body!!!!!!fyi : they had trivia night that night, and I was watching the crazy trivia people on the bar top just writing away.. AND THEY WERE SERRRIOOOOOUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!.. I really wanted to go on my iphone and say the answers outloud to just fuck with them :) that would have been really fun.. notttttttttttt!!! You can get yourself $5 for a slice of pizza you can barely finish. &#160;Not best ever but very reasonable quality per dollar. &#160;The salads are on the bland side as well but exactly like the pizza make up for it in size. &#160;The pasta dishes are better, but not really worth the price of admission. &#160;Best part of this Talarico's? Skilled bartenders. &#160;I've had some of the best made Manhattans and martinis here. &#160;The giant LCD TVs the size of Kansas on both sizes of the bar are nice if you feel like watching the game. &#160;Plus if you enjoy grooving to the smooth stylings of wolves baying at the moon, Sun-Tues are karaoke nights. The food was pretty good and quite reasonable, atmosphere was good, but my service was much to be desired. The waitress basically forgot about us, never refilling drinks, and when she finally did come back messed up the drink order. We then had to flag down another server later much past drinks and food were gone for our bill. We headed to Talarico's because they would be able to accommodate our large group. I was surprised to see how large it was inside! The gigantic delicious pizza made me feel like I was Alice in Wonderland - it was that big. The staff and other patrons were super friendly and the prices were good.The interior decorations are interesting, because it used to be a Chinese restaurant, and there's some left over wall art from that business. I think it's fun. Late Night Dilemma: I'm hungry.Late Night Solution: Talarico's Pizzeria &amp; Lounge.The pizza was as big as my head. So cheap. So good. Delicious tap of beer. Beautiful decor. If I'm in Seattle again, I'll hit this place up. I prefer a less sweet tomato sauce on my pizza, so this didn't do it for me. Seemed like a nice enough place, though - and if you like big slices of kind of rubbery, pseudo-new york style pizza, you'll probably like it. Kind of weird that they won't do take-out, though (maybe this has changed since I visited). It's a pizza place. Put it in a box, let me pay for it and let me go. Odd. Having not lived in West Seattle for a few years, I had yet to stumble into Talarico's since it was New Luck Toy, which I had frequented.It was nice to see what they had done to the place.They apparently kept a bunch of the Chinese decor here and there, but cleared out pretty much all of the walls.One, huge, open space surrounding the large bar, but even with the new windows on the California Ave side, the place was still incredibly dark. Sure, I enjoy dim, romantic lighting for dates...but I still want to be able to SEE my date, as well as what I'm eating. Not sure that would be possible in the back.Also, on a Friday evening around 5pm it was pretty dead, which isn't good for business, but I'm rarely a fan of crowds anyways, so I liked it.My friend and I each got a slice of pizza from the happy hour menu and were surprised with the results.Giant slices for $3.50? Amazing.Thin crust, good cheese, not remotely fitting on the plate.Not enough for a meal, but for a large, hearty snack? Perfect.I'll be coming back for that alone. what's up with the tiny slices? I have nothing against Talaricos. I'm sure we'll be back. While I was wowed by the *size* of the slice, I wasn't really wowed by anything else on the recent Wednesday night trip there with the bf.The pizzas slices we got were big. Definitely. I would have to agree the sauce is lacking in the flavor department, as well as the crust being pretty non-descript, but if you slam enough tasty toppings on there it's more than edible. The pricing isn't too bad for what you're getting, but I think next time I may delve deeper into their menu.Our lovely server was attentive, but not overly so - just how I like 'em.The decor was having a bit of identity crisis towards the back of the bar, but from our table next to one of the open windows in front it seemed like a cozy place to have a slice and a beer and a bit of conversation with a date or a significant other or even a friend (or a few).Husky Deli is right across the street, so if you can manage to keep your appetite going long enough after one of those monstrous slices (good luck with that), you can grab some ice cream for the trip back to your car (or so I've heard). This is nice, friendly neighborhood gathering place. &#160;Enjoyed some happy hour wine and pizza and enjoyed it a great deal. &#160;However, the wine glasses could have used a little extra washing and overall TLC -- both of the glasses I got were dirty. &#160;Kind of a cross between hard water stains and many layers of lipstick. &#160;It was a little off-putting, but I didn't want to make a fuss, so I didn't say anything. &#160;I really liked that the pizza portions are generous and that the pie isn't greasy on the bottom. &#160;I felt like I was being calorie conscious, even though I was essentially eating the equivalent of several pieces of pizza in one sitting. &#160;In regards to the overall environment, I like that the place wasn't too loud even with it being a Friday night and happy hour. &#160;I could actually carry on a conversation with my friend without having to shout. I give this place three stars because it wasn't like I was wowed, but I wasn't disappointed either. &#160;It made for a nice evening. Talarico's is in my neighborhood. &#160;I used to live near a Pagliacci's By the Slice restaurant and despite my love/hate relationship with Pagliacci's, you just need pizza by the slice! &#160;So when this place opened in West Seattle I was so excited. &#160;The atmosphere looked great, dark and an open fireplace to sit at. &#160;I was hopeful. Then I had a slice, paid another visit and had a slice, and another visit and another, every visit feeling very disappointed, but it is the only slice option I had! &#160;The pizza is o.k. &#160;The slices are huge and made to order. &#160;But they lack flavor, the sauce is boring, the slice is boring. &#160;Then one night on whim, I order the spaghetti and meatballs. Hallelujah! &#160;It was delicious! &#160;Now my boyfriend faithfully orders the chicken parm every time and loves it, so my guess is to stick to the entrees. &#160;The meatballs were amazing. &#160;A little spicy and maybe the best I have had in Seattle. &#160;I was shocked to find such a basic dish be so great at a place that is all about pizza. &#160;So scrap your slice and go for the meatballs and you won't be disappointed. Went there last night with my girlfriend and had a good time.I liked the decor, though on closer inspection we noticed that it really didn't match too well. There were disco balls hanging next to some dragon style art and there were all sorts of different styles of chandeliers, but it still looked cool. My only problem with the design of the place was that they only had 2 TVs, one on each side of the bar. Unfortunately were I was seated you couldn't see at all, but it didn't really bother me as I was enjoying conversing with my GF. I ordered a nice big slice of the Sinatra, it had Spicy Sausage, Pepperoncini, Black Olives, Mozzarella &amp; Marinara. The slice was nice and large and it tasted pretty good too. My GF decided to "build her own" and had Calamata Olives, Goat Cheese, Tomatoes, Jalape&#241;os Mozzarella &amp; Marinara, it looked tasty and she seemed to like it. We also enjoyed a couple drinks, some Manny's for me and a Session for the little lady. ;)Overall it was a nice dinner, great portions, good prices and a nice ambiance. Also our waitress was really friendly and quite attentive, refiling and checking in on us regularly. If you are in the area and looking for a huge slice of pizza then check this place out. Personally, I really love this place! The atmosphere is great, from the fireplace, romantic chandelier lighting, secluded booths, right down to the bamboo tables. Here's a link to some images of the place: http://www.talaricoswest&#8230;Not to mention, how can you go wrong with a 14" slice of pizza for $5? Being the small eater that I am, this can usually last me two or three meals. For $5! I have tried most of them and they are all splendid.The Carpaccio appetizer is a-ma-zing! I also greatly enjoyed the House Made Meatballs. Basically, I have not been disappointed in anything I have eaten here so far!If you are worried about drinking and driving, the bus service is great to the area. You can catch a 57, 55, 54, or 22 to the "Alaska Junction."* Happy Hour 7 Days 4-6pm (draft beers $3, well drinks $4, $3 pizza slices)* Karaoke -Trivia -Live Music (I have heard one show here, and I have to say it was very good, made for a fun date!) Must try it is really unique and super duper good! Not the best pizza but certainly the biggest! &#160;The pizza is really good though. &#160;There is also a kick ass happy hour, the decor is cool and in the summer the windows open! &#160;I like it b/c it is trendy without being too trendy. Great atmosphere and tall, solid wood booths that make room for private conversations without whispering. &#160;I like the chandeliers and the oval bar in the center! &#160;The double sided plasma TV above the bar makes it easy to watch whichever game is on.My server was friendly and super shy about asking for our Id's. &#160;She was attentive and great at serving us with mild interruption. &#160;There was no hesitation when we asked for her recommendations to which pizza slice(s) we should try and she warned that they were about the size of our menus and we may not want for a salad after one slice each. &#160;She was on point!These slices are gigantic! &#160;I did read other reviews and saw the pic's but I wasn't a believer until I was introduced to the actual pizza! &#160;OMG. &#160;HUGE. &#160;We both tried the Coppola which is a red pepper with (goat or mozzarella) cheese. &#160;The pizza slice was so big I had to cut it in half length wise and ended up only eating half of my half. &#160;It was delicious. &#160;The crust was thin with a layer of crunch but some softness near the beginning of the toppings. &#160;Really, really cheesy! &#160;I also noticed that it wasn't greasy at all which is great as opposed to the opposite in which case I consider a deal breaker!I would come here again! &#160;During HH, I ordered three rum and cokes and a slice of pizza totaling to $17. &#160;Talarico's was sponsoring the Aids benefit that local businesses were supporting and it was great to know that a large percentage of our meal revenue was being donated. &#160;A great setting for a date, group of friends and/or a late afternoon lunch! YUM! This place had some excellent pizza. I'd go for the slice at $5 a pop. My husband who can put down a large pizza at little Caesar's was able to put two down and was done so don't be tempted to get the whole pizza. It was really delicious. Crust was thin and the perfect with just the right blend of crisp and soft. The toppings were amazing. The place got busy and pizza took a bit, but salad tided us over. Also, service was friendly but not overbearing and refills was super consistent. What more can you ask. It was FANTASTIC! I wasn't terribly impressed with Talarico's. The really big pizza is neat, but seems to be the claim to fame. I found their lack of imagination in pizza types to be silly. Their beer list was not as complete as I would have hoped, as is mentioned in some other yelper reviews. Inside, it is a little dark for my taste, but the booths are comfy and large enough for a decent sized party to all be able to sit and eat the huge pizza comfortably.I'd likely not go back if it's up to me, but I'd join someone for drinks. 4.5 *One of our friends is ADDICTED to Talarico's. &#160;I'm pretty sure that when her lease was up recently she decided to stay in West Seattle simply for the proximity to said pizza.We've been there for trivia night several times as well as various other nights and we have never received anything but awesome service. &#160;The food is great and it is very good pizza especially during happy hour. &#160;The guy who runs the trivia nights is fun and the other customers tend to be a big heckling one liner shouting group by the end.Try the Sinatra or Coppola slices and you won't regret it.I am only deducting 1/2 a star because trivia usually starts too late on a weeknight for me. Frack me! Sorry Ive been watching too much Battlestar,but I wish I would've known that this was a 21 and up place cause our 3 yr old was with us. So that evening didn't start out great,but we found tv parking!We ended up going to the place next door which is family friendly and afterwards got one of their mondo slices. I thought is was pretty good and probably even better when served right there at the joint. Still I have yet to find pizza like Ive had in NY. I know I know I'm a whiner about pizza :) Great party pizza though b/c we saw someone carrying out one the size of a table. 4 of us went in to get pizza and they tried to seat us at the big table with the fireplace in the deep dark black corner near the back (which I'm sure would have allowed them to forget about us). We asked for one of the many empty booths we passed as we were walked into the darkness, and the hostess sat us in a booth.We ordered some beer and proceeded to "argue" over what we wanted on our huge pizza. We settled for half Hawaiian and half pepperoni-jalapeno. You can get a slice made to order how you want it, or you can get a huge 8-slice pizza with your choice of toppings or one of their own pizza types. Adam ordered some meatballs for appetizer (Wedding Singer sized meatballs). They were good, but not the best I've had. The pizza came out and it took up almost half of the table. It was decent pizza, the slices were huge (which is part of the gimmick). The pepperoni side was pretty good, the Hawaiian side was disappointing (diced ham would be better than shaved deli-style ham IMO). For the pizza, the meatballs, and 8 beers, it was almost $100 (before tip). It was a fun place to go for a change, but if you're looking for quality in a pizza and not quantity, I would suggest going elsewhere.
Sweet tea, sweet potato fries, fried green tomatoes with a jalapeno ranchy sauce. Yum. They've expanded their hours as well, so you should eat there all the time. Try the mojito. Try the catfish.Actually, just go with a bunch of friends and order everything on the menu. I have never been able to eat my food in one sitting. It may be pricey, but you're essentially getting two meals....Support your local businesses. Especially the ones with hot tattoo-laden servers. Servers who are surprisingly pleasant.My company has had half a dozen "business lunches" here in the past year (AND I go here in my off time) and EVERY SINGLE person we have taken to Pig Iron has fallen immediately in love. First, it was the flavor of my mate's delicious and perfectly-seasoned baked beans. Then it was the taste of his delectable catfish sandwich. Then I started on my own plate... :)Pulled pork is the standard bearer for great, basic barbecue and this was the moment I've been looking for since moving to Seattle from Chicago in the twilight of 1999: THE Best Barbecue in Seattle, hands down.The mild sauce had plenty of home-made zing with all the spices working together to create a rich, full experience for every zing-starved zone in my mouth. One specific flavor dominated perfectly, and I identify it as coriander. Double-Plus Yum.But oh my God today, the spinach... Jalapeno Creamed Spinach to be precise, this modestly-presented fixin' was beyond the pale of yum perfection. I would have to say it is Quadruple-Plus Yum Extreme to the Max. Yeah, that's my assessment and I'm sticking to it like Junior Bush sticks to a quagmire.I will be back and I will try many things on this menu, even the electric-red velvet cake which was certainly not colored with anything from nature. Even so, I am sold. This is it, my children. Georgetown has birthed the best Barbecue.And oh yeah, the tattooed lady waitresses all rock the house... I love their evil BBQ Pig logo; it's cute in a tough Georgetown kind of way and fits. &#160;Having not grown up in a BBQ popular city I have no idea what's good or bad when it comes to the stuff. &#160;But every once in a while I get a craving for some baby backs and since I can't for the life of me cook baby backs or any pork product for that matter I always go out to satisfy this craving.I met a friend here for dinner the other night, she enjoys the beef brisket very much and that's what she had along with the greens and sweet potato fries it was just as good as the last time she had it so that's a good sign. &#160;I went with the 1/2 rack of baby back ribs, they were tasty, smoky, sweet, juicy and messy all at the same time; they were lovely I'm telling you. &#160;For my sides I went with the jalapeno spinach casserole, another tasty treat for my taste buds to enjoy, and the sweet potato fries, sweet, fried and salty a perfect combination if you ask me. &#160;I was pleasantly surprised with the yumminess of my dinner, they did not disappoint.They had some interesting specialty cocktails but we by passed those for a pitcher of Shiner Bock, something I never had before. &#160;It was good, almost too good because it gave me the burps like no beer has before, it was very unlady like of me but I was in Georgetown after all so I guess it was ok. I really liked this place. &#160;Though I'm not from Texas, I wasn't raised in a smokehouse and don't have a hybrid of BBQ sauce in my veins.BBQ seems to be one of those touchy subjects with people, like religion. &#160;We went with some people that do pride themselves on knowing good BBQ, did live in Texas and well have elite palettes. &#160;They enjoyed it.Of course the place has a little of the Seattle hipster charm. &#160;A great sweet tea mojito that you would kill for. &#160;And plenty of room for groups. &#160;I got a great plate of turkey, while the others got a variety. &#160;Everyone left happy and full! I'm from South Carolina and it's hard to find good pulled pork BBQ, sweet tea, and fried green tomatoes within a 1000 mile radius of Seattle. &#160;Seriously, finding sweet tea is like finding gold. &#160;(if you don't like tea, their cherry limeaid rocks)Pig Iron is soooo good! &#160;Four delicious sauces to chose from, ribs, pulled pork, you name it...so good. &#160;My only complaint is their stupid hours. &#160;They are open the oddest times and never on the weekends. &#160;It's so lame. &#160;So if you can squeeze it in your week day schedule to get all the way down there (it's good to do a joint Costco/Pig Iron outing) it's well worth the trip! It's OK. &#160;The meat doesn't have a lot of smokey taste. &#160;The vinegary sauce is tasty, but it shouldn't outshine the meat which it does.This place is overrated and overpriced. I tried this place on a whim the other day when passing by. My friend and I both got the pulled pork plate. What I really wanted was a BBQ sandwich, so I was disappointed that the plate was just pulled pork (with two sides; I got the mashed potato salad and the coleslaw). Then I tried the meat and fell nearly in love. &#160;It was awesome. I needed more BBQ sauce, personally, but that was an easy fix with the maple syrup-type dispensers of sauce nearby. I wasn't too crazy about the sides. The coleslaw was ok, but the mashed potato salad was a little bland. It lacked the zing I was hoping for, I guess. Their cherry limeade is awesome, too. After tip, etc, my friend and I spent about $20/ea. This is a bit pricey for BBQ in my opinion (for just a sandwich it's $8.50), even if the portions were quite substantial. Pork butt is not a costly cut of meat, after all.
It's hard to separate the establishment itself from the less-than-desirable crowd I came across here last night. The phrase 'meat market' comes to mind, and not the kind you find at Pike Place. Within minutes of entering, three Italian gentlemen in town for New Year's had invited us to go back to their hotel for wine. Hmm...tempting. And it's bad enough when there's even a line for the men's room, but line of frat boys for the men's room is just unacceptable.I couldn't even drink my vodka tonic. How one screws up a vodka tonic I can't be sure, but the bartender sure managed to. I've been here before for lunch and it wasn't quite such a nightmare, but I shan't be back during the witching hours any time soon. Here's why this gets four stars:Their burgers are awesome.They have good (kinda expensive) beerTheir patio is fantastically amazing and amazingly fantastic for people watching during the Fremont Sunday Market and I can only imagine during the Street Fair. &#160;Get out there when the Sun is shining, drink and be merry!The frat crowd that everyone who gave this place low stars for? &#160;It pretty much exists after dark. &#160;Question: &#160;If you're drinking in Fremont at night, are you likely to go here or one of the other Fremont bars with great live music and cheap beer?You answered this place? &#160;HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!Moral of my mocking laughter: &#160;Go here during the day for good food and chilaxin'. &#160;Just make it a rule of thumb to not head here after dark, you'll like this place just as much as I do! One night, I joined some friends here after a late night at work. &#160;My hilariously boozed-up boyfriend greeted me at the door, and I commented that I was surprised I'd never before been here, after living in Seattle for almost 10 years. &#160;He stumbled to my side and said "let me give you a quick tour" as he led me through the narrow bar area. &#160;"Here are some douchebags on the left (points right), some assholes on your right (gestures left) and over here, some loud bitches with cankles." &#160;Pretty much sums it up. &#160;I agree that this would be a pretty good place if it weren't for the people. &#160;The Red Door is spacious and comfortable, with good lighting and a patio. &#160;The food was actually really good, and be selection of beverages was great. &#160;The sliders, artichoke dip and nachos were tasty and generously portioned. &#160;I can imagine that the patio for happy hour on a sunny afternoon would be the best way to take advantage of what this place has to offer.Not that the scene would be wrong for everyone, but it's just not my thing. &#160;Maybe I would have loved it when I was 21. &#160;On the other hand, when I was 21 I was going to Neighbors...back when it was actually a gay bar....or the Capitol Club/Baltic Room. &#160; Not that there weren't douchebags there-- hipster douchebags! &#160;I guess I just have very little tolerance for this sort of thing anymore...If I'm going to a meatmarket, I'd rather leave with some good Bratwurst, not Douchey McDoucherson. I ate here during the Fremont Solstice parade, and it was pretty packed. &#160;Despite this, the service was great, and so were the fries, but otherwise it was below average. &#160;The veggie burger was one of the frozen varieties found in stores, and the "avocado" on it (for $1.50 extra) was just guacamole. &#160; Some others in the party didn't finish their food. &#160; I'd recommend The Silence Heart Nest, which is a block away, over The Red Door. I've come for lunch on weekdays before. &#160;Tolerable; decent food. &#160;Its night life completely pisses on any positives this place may have earned.Weak, over-priced drinks that took for freaking ever to get from stressed bartenders. &#160;Buy two at once is all I can recommend.Orange trashy chicks who don't mind being publicly felt up in full view of people sitting at the table beside them.Douche bag central where said uber-douches don't seem to mind that nipples don't actually respond during conversation.Jesus, I feel violated just thinking back to last weekend. &#160;If full body condoms were available to me, I still wouldn't reenter this place on a Friday night again.Next time, just abort me. Went on a Saturday night and turned out to be pretty fun. &#160;Its a good place to have a drink, mingle, chill. Outdoor patio is a bonus. They didn't have any hennessy though. It got pretty crowded too. At this point you couldn't pay me to go here. The place is jam packed full of 30 something ex-frat boy douche bags, and some of the dumbest women on the planet. The line for the mens room is ridiculous because the guys here have to sit down to pee because they're vaginas. If your girlfriend goes to the ladies room, your not aloud to wait for her within fifty feet of the door. The bartenders are slow, and they get bitter when you don't tip them for delivering your drinks slower then the line moves at the DMV. There are more flat out disrespectful people per square inch then anywhere I've come across thus far. If you do go, its faster to leave and use the restroom at Brouwers and come back. I didn't know that restaurants still offered potato chips as sides and then serve you Ruffles. Seriously. I didn't know that! I didn't know Ruffles still even existed! I guess I've just been spoiled with Tim's everywhere else. I was actually quite pleased with my bacon-blue cheese burger, but only because they were generous with the blue cheese, the bacon was thick and the bun was fresh and didn't fall apart. The meat itself was obviously a tasteless frozen patty and overcooked. I can't in good conscience give the Red Door more than two stars, because I've been there after 9pm on Fridays and Saturdays and it's an absolute nightmare. This is a daytime/early evening place only. Meh. Service was mediocre, despite it not being that busy. My friend's drink was tiny (imagine a vodka tonic served in a shot glass) for some odd reason. And several of our dishes had fries that were almost cold.I like that there's lots of room here, unlike so many of the tiny and cramped places in Fremont, but otherwise just mediocre.A good place for lunch should you happen to work in Fremont, though. Pretty good sandwich/burger choices.

The only part of the crowd I liked were of course, the party that was with me but other than that, these guys are a little ... suspect. The bouncer was sweet to me though insisting that I go up to the bartender and ask for a drink on the house for my birthday but I couldn't even get up the nerve. It sounded too pretentious to demand a drink! &#160;Pro: No cover charge, decent drinks + fast service (if you're a girl), outdoor patioCons: Way too popular. Places lose their appeal if everyone thinks its the new hot spot. I guess I was a newbie too though.For the most part, I enjoyed myself with my friends but if they weren't with me, I think I would have wanted to get out of there pronto to hit a place that wasn't so "I'm too cool, this is where all the cool kids go" vibe. The Red Door is a reliable place to start a night out in Fremont, I tend to end up here pretty frequently during visits to Seattle. My friends and I used come here when I lived in Seattle as well. The space is pretty roomy although it does get pretty packed on weekend nights and unfortunately the ratio tends to work out to be a lot more guys than girls.There are several flat screen TV's so this is a good option if you'd like to catch the end of a game before continuing your night out. Their selection of beers is commendable and they also feature a full bar as well. My recommendation for a Friday or Saturday night is to grab a table near the window, you'll be more comfortable while still being in the center of the action around the bar. The Red Door (+):-no cover charge-easy to mingle with some attractive post-college young professionals-pitcher of sangria is delish to share between 4 ladies-big enough to mix with a lot of people or just sit at a table with your group of friendsThe Red Door (-):-Really packed and loud on the weekends, hard to move without being bumped around like a pinball-drunk people stepping on you, spilling their drinks.-some fratty just-turned-21 crowd, designer brand-showy people.It's fun for what it is-- a lively bar. Flaunt your stuff, get a little tipsy. Red Door is full of stuck up hippies, douche bag dudes, and dumb babbling chicks. The food is pretty good, yes ...Along with happy hour prices. The server we had at lunch one day was pretty slow and seemed either scattered or just clueless. For some reason she had to take our debit card when we were paying with cash in order to get us drinks to go along with our lunch. Ended up not giving it back after we forgot that we had to given it to her. And it took for ever for her to come check up on us even though she was walking around the section we were sitting in. Definitely a meat market scene which can be quite annoying. First warm, sunny day in months, so we opted to sit on the patio at the Red Door, enjoying some iced tea and a wonderful lunch. &#160;The service was prompt and polished, everyone on point, all requests responded to with a smile. &#160;I had the incredible mushroom soup - best I've had in awhile! &#160;I asked for one of my usual sandwiches (bacon, lettuce and swiss, no mayo) and it was perfect. &#160;Great prices, too. &#160;I'll try the beer next time and just about everything on their food menu (it was hard to choose!). Its not the establishment's fault really. I have had good times there, but mostly I've been on a thursday, friday or saturday when it was packed - so much so that its hard to move around... the patio is nice when its too too cold to be outside. I've always felt like I'm in a meat market. It tends to appeal to the "frat boy" clientele and sometimes there just aren't enough nice people there to make it worth your while. I'm gonna repeat what i've been reading; its kinda full of douche bags, assholes and loud bitchy girls. I like the Red Door in small doses.People are generally friendly, the place is always lively and packed and there is a decent patio. I've never had much of a problem getting to and out of the bar area and the bartenders do an ok job. The biggest drawback is $9.50 for a pint of Guinness! Ouch. So far they are winning the worst Guinness price in Seattle award. Thus a 2. I'm a frequent visitor here. Not exactly sure why. The service is good and the bartenders are always super nice. I guess its because it draws a nice crowd and seating can be found. Its the place in Fremont to go when you want to be around people, but don't want the dance crowd at Ballroom.My favorite night there is 9/11....by far! The food was pretty decent here, but everything else was quite disappointing. I had to tell my server my order not once, not twice, but three times; and she still got it wrong. (All I asked for was no tomatoes, so it wasn't anything complicated.) The bartender did not know how to make an old fashioned (a pretty basic drink, I think) and I heard him yelling across the bar asking the other employees what was in it. I should have canceled that order then and there, but oh well. The worse part of the experience though, where the other diners. This place is nothing more than an aging frat bar. Everyone there was ridiculous looking and acting, making the people watching quite decent. However, there were at least two times that my fiance and I had to stop eating because we were nauseated by the overwhelming smell of cologne. Although the food is decent, I would definitely advise that people pass on this place. Unless, of course, you yourself are an aging frat boy, and in that case, welcome home. Every time I have been here this place is packed full of too many patrons and too few waitstaff and bartenders. &#160;I really dont like having to wait in line 10-15 minutes for a drink in a busy bar when the bartenders want to stop and have conversations with their friends and co-workers.
AMBIENCE - B- - (bathrooms are quite a walk through a long maze)SERVICE - B - (they don't have UNI all the time) FOOD - B- &#160;(different and newer menu selections)PRICE - C (wah!!! - price increase)This experience happened sometime right after prices were raised back in May/June 2012.Prices are now 1.35, 1.85, 2.45, 2.95, and 3.95. &#160;Still good deal. But gone are the cheap deals! 1 - 3. TIP!!! &#160;--- &#160;So - I understand that the conveyor belt is pretty daunting and most items that I want are not going around, so I ALWAYS use the "write your own" order forms to get all my nigiri and fried hot items to come out fresh. I get disappointed most times as they seem never seem to have UNI (sea urchin) when I show up sometimes &#160;( I go down to "SushiLand" down the street - they never seem to run out and they charge $3.00 for 2 pieces!) &#160; ... But, Genki charges $3 also - if they had some in stock!More rolls introduced. &#160;New menu. Seems they're trying a new by opening later hours until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. on Thurs - Sat. Presentation were lots prettier. &#160;Hope they stay up with quality of presentation. I came here recently after relocating from Toronto, the home of cheap and delicious Japanese food, but sadly expensive fresh seafood and was ecstatic to learn that there was a Genki Sushi in Seattle, above a QFC nonetheless. For belt sushi, there was definitely a healthy variety and all the nigiris were super fresh. The selection of fresh fish was impressive: hamachi, toro, saba, etc. It would have been great if there was uni, but I'm no complaining. We didn't have any mochi balls, but they did have the creme caramel desserts and your usual Japanese stuff. Being able to walk into a place and start eating immediately is pretty convenient. I would recommend to steer clear of any deep fried items: deep fried lobster sushi, calamari, or salmon skin. There's either MSG or something else in the batter that left a weird aftertaste. The staff was friendly and accommodating, but as all the other reviewers have noted, it's pretty expensive for belt sushi and shouldn't be that way. It would be a shame if that's why they start losing business. I've never had conveyor belt sushi, but after browsing a couple reviews I am getting a sense that the general consensus about these places is that they serve mediocre and not-so-fresh sushi.They are right. But I don't think 3 stars justifies the critical nature of these late night sushi joints. Yes, the sushi was probably sitting for 3 hours, and maybe perhaps were &#160;made yesterday. &#160;But oh man when you just got done drinking and you are craving for some food this place fits the bill nicely (most sushi is under 4 bucks). My prior review was 4/5 stars....I just took one away though, and here's why, long story short:About 2-3 weeks ago, I was excited for sushi night, wanted to takeout this time. I went online to the Genki Sushi and checked out their menu. I called in and ordered.Problem #1: "Oh we don't have that any more" for a few items#2: Some items listed had "options" that weren't clearly communicated over the phone.#3: Essentially, most of the online menu was outdated#4: I still had to wait 15 minutes, even though I showed up 5 min later that when they told me it would be ready#5: What?! The prices changed two months ago and nobody's updated the website? So I owe ~$10 more dollars than expected.Bummer. I still like the quality of their sushi better than SushiLand down the street though. So, I'll keep coming here. Reluctantly. I just tried this place out. it was around 3 in the afternoon. so it was pretty dead. i just saw the same things going by over and over and i was starting to think they weren't going to make anything new. i know that i could ask, and i know it was a slow time of the day. but i saw them cutting up a lot of fish so i just kept thinking something was going to come. never did. i had avocado roll, avocado salmon roll, and some crunchy salmon thing. they weren't bad but i was ready for something else other then salmon and avocado lol.everything we had was on the soggy side. but not bad for not being fresh. everyone was very friendly though, i did like the atmosphere. and i didnt dislike anything we ate. i did dislike that they raised there prices to 1.35 1.85 2.45 and 2.95. most of them being 2.45. though i still managed to only spend about $12 on myself i also didnt like watching them open what looked like packaged fish from the QFC downstairs. they are open until 2am though so i could see myself coming here after a concert or festival or something at the seattle center, looking for food. so basically if your looking for cheap sushi, nice people, and somewhere to go late at night, this is a great choice! if you are looking for somewhere nice to go for dinner id say go to wasabi! I've given this location of Genki Sushi a few tries and I always leave disappointed. My main concern is that the sushi on the conveyor belt rarely looks fresh and what does appear to have been made recently usually is something that I pass up. Not their fault of course and they have a system where you can order (only three items at a time) whatever you're in the mood for. My main complaint is that it seems nearly impossible to get the attention of anyone working there to take the special request slip! It feels equally as difficult to ask for your bill once you're finished. It's difficult to promote an establishment that makes your dining experience feel like so much work. My first trip here I wasn't happy with the cooked rolls. &#160;BUT my second try was amazing when I tried the raw fish rolls and I am not one that has ever liked raw fish. &#160;I am so glad I decided to give this place a try and be adventurous. &#160;I think this is my new sushi spot. &#160;The prices are a steal, facilities are clean, wait staff is very helpful, the fish is fresh, the service is prompt, and their rolls were very flavorful. &#160;The combinations of the types of rolls they make are like a symphony for my taste buds, hitting every portion of my palate with beauty. &#160;I had been avoiding sushi for a few months now, but I will no longer avoid it because Genki Sushi is so mouth-wateringly delish!!! Dinner and drinks for 2 for less than $30? Yes please.I've been here a few times and never disliked anything that I've tried, or had issues with service. It's pretty no-frills, but hey, sometimes a girl just needs to EAT. Last week they were quite accomodating of my sister's food allergy and took great care to ensure that I didn't have to stab her in the ass with an Epi-Pen. Thanks, guys! Amazingly good sushi! &#160;I sat at the bar and although I only ordered some pretty standard stuff [spicy tuna roll, etcetera], the sushi chef was cool, no attitude about my boring order. &#160;Next time I am in Seattle, I will be back. &#160;BTW, it gets really busy for lunch on weekdays, so be prepared. This is the first Genki location in Washington and it is my favorite. I went to Genki alot when I visited Hawaii like 4x a year for a few years in the past and I love Genki. The main reason I love this specific location so much as it's ambiance is amazing! It is upscale and the decor is not your typical Genki sushi in Hawaii or other locations here in WA. I love how it is near the Seattle Center but you get free parking because there is a garage in this building. I also noticed that they dropped their prices a little bit compared to when it first opened I believe in 2008 or 2009. I'd prefer Genki over Sushiland and my college friends and I used to go there all the time when we were in college. If you want classy, go to this one. My other experience with kaitenzushi in Seattle is Blue C, so from the get-go the prices are much better. &#160;My go-to nigiri is salmon, and Genki Sushi has several different kinds of salmon that taste fresh and good. &#160;Their selection is heavy on rolls, which I didn't try. &#160;I did have the mochi balls with red bean paste filling (like you get at dim sum), and those were fresh and warm, though sparing on the mochi. &#160;However, I wouldn't recommend their other cooked dishes such as the takoyaki, which is really quite bad. My favoirte sushi place. &#160;It was better when it was cheaper. &#160;Kicks sushi land in the **
This joint is a very popular teriyaki spot for one reason. &#160;Delicious teriyaki!! Tasty Chicken Katsu as well. Try a lunch bowl sometime. This used to be my go-to lunch spot for some delicious tofu teriyaki, but then something changed. &#160;Owners? &#160;Chef? Both? &#160;Whatever it was, it hasn't been the same in months. &#160;Now, I can't even order the tofu since it is not as dependable as it once was. &#160;I still go there on occasion, but I no longer go with high hopes of deliciousness. Tasty tofu Teriyaki! I'm vegetarian, so I can't speak on their other dishes, but the tofu teriyaki satisfies my Teriyaki craving. Small, there's only one table to sit at so call ahead and get your order to go.
Discovered this place while waiting for a client to show up for a meeting. Thankfully they were late. I couldn't have been more happily surprised and well fed.I ordered the small spaghetti with meat sauce. The portion was bigger than expected but as it turned out if it had been less. I probably would have ordered more. The owner was there and served my meal which came with a piece of garlic bread. &#160;At no additional cost I had a great &#160;conversation, great authentic freshly made to order food and reason to go back.You should go. I really like this place. &#160;The qualities of this place are the neighborhood Italian dive place with the good food and great memories associated with it! &#160;They actually know how to use oregano and other spices in their pizza, meatballs and sausage heroes! &#160;They even have great bread for the heroes! &#160;The service is always good and as another reviewer posted, they are not shy about telling you what is great that day! &#160; &#160;If you want a bite of Italian and your at the market, check this place out!. Absolutely delicious sandwiches. I've gotten a number of them. They are all delicious but the stromboli is my favorite. Love the atmosphere as well.
This place is pretty cool. I was suprised that their prices are pretty reasonable considering it is an indie. I didn't get a chance to check out the used just because I didn't want to check my bag. Otherwise, I can't complain about a store that has a good selection and good prices. I'll definitely go back next time I visit Seattle, hopefully, with more money and time to really browse the shelves. I don't really buy music from brick and mortars anymore, but I support this fine shop by eating here whenever I can. Reasonable prices, good coffee, perfect bacon, fun atmosphere. Easy Street is the best. The food is AMAZING!! And they are always ok with substituting ingredients at no extra charge. Prices are totally worth it! It's our fav saturday breakfast place. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because if you go with a group larger than 3 people the wait can be f-ing long! The best! &#160;Nothing else like it and it's walking distance from my house! &#160;The best music around. &#160;And the .25 vinyl records for sale during Summerfest can't be beat! &#160; Oh and the food's good too! Again: YELP WORKS... I got a response from management, I'll stop again a couple of times and post any findings... I really hope they improve quality of the thirts but I don't expect it. Great amount of good music. Very helpful service. Good coffee. When I come here I walk right past up past the main floor to the second floor for all my lp needs. Their selection of vinyl is great. I've found a lot of rare gems hiding in this place and sometimes can't understand how lucky I get. I guess they get a lot of good traders. The prices are fair on the used merch which is cool. I can't say the same for the new CD sets.I've been to live shows here that were great and had drinks with friends. Good atmosphere, good waitstaff, pretty cool people. Not worth the hour wait on a Saturday morning for brunch. If you go, stick with the omelets. Smallish but very good selection of new and used vinyl upstairs, reasonably priced. &#160;I picked up Rattle &amp; Hum for 8 bucks this weekend, not bad for a double LP. &#160; For some reason I didn't nab the double album of Elvis' Sun years, I'll probably have to go back and get that sometime. &#160;I think I just showed my age. Part restaurant, part independent record store. &#160;Pretty much couldn't be a better combo. &#160;I really like this place, and my fiance is CRAZY about it. &#160;I would say that I think we're they're target audience - a couple of thirty-something urbanites, but I know this place to be equally loved by people twice and half our age. Yeah, ya know, it's a greasy spoon at the junction &#160;(is it "at" or "in the junction"?), &#160;with polite tattooed hipsters waiting on you, and music on the speakers. &#160;You could do worse. Great portions of food, cheap prices but like most reviews, yes you will be waiting at least 30 min for your food to come.. but recommended for the budget conscious. Easy Street is a favorite for me and the hubs! &#160;The Horton Heat Hash is AMAZING! &#160;It really isn't very spicy (for those who fear)...its has a unique flavor to it that I can't quite name, but its sooooo good! &#160;As many times as I have been there, yes...the service can be slow at times, but its not always like that. &#160;Darcy is a nice waitress, prices great, food filling, and coffee good too :) I love Easy Street for breakfast! &#160;It is super cheap and the food is really good. &#160;Lots of vegetarian friendly options- the veggie sausage isn't bad. &#160; I've never had a problem with the service-in fact, its always been pretty good. &#160;Be prepared for a wait, but really, where can you go out for breakfast that doesn't have a wait? alright! everything on the menu looked great, but i settled with huevos rancheros and was not disappointed- &#160;the flavors were tasty and the portion size was perfect for a hungry belly. &#160;the lady server was friendly and attentive. i will be coming back. great brunch. &#160;pretentious crowd. &#160;great music. &#160;pretentious crowd. I'm sad to think that the day might come when record stores are rendered a thing of the past. In the age of iTunes, I still prefer to walk into a brick and mortar record store and peruse the album covers. Ok, so they're not actually album covers, they're CD cases, but still. (I do know what records are, though. My Dad has an extensive collection of Elvis vinyl that I shudder to think will someday be mine by way of unfortunate inheritance. eBay, here I come.)Easy Street is a small reminder of why I love Seattle. West Seattle, in particular. It's not a large joint, but it has a great selection of new and old. And ... a frickin' caf&#233;! On this snowy Monday, we decided to hit Easy Street for breakfast. The menu rocks. I struggled mightily to decide between the Horton Heat Hash and the Bizkits and Gravy. The Bennie and the Jets (eggs benedict) is only available on Saturdays and Sundays, so I settled on the Easy Rider - a simple bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast samich. It was the goods. Alexis S. had the James Browns (hashbrowns topped with all sorts of goodies of the vegetarian variety). Also very tasty. Both dishes were just greasy enough. I mean, any less greasy and they just wouldn't have fit the expectation you may have for a corner record store/caf&#233; combo joint with a tattooed-up hipster wait staff.Where else can you enjoy a sit-down breakfast for two, lattes included, and pick up a Run DMC compilation AND an authentic copy of Ministry's 'Jesus Built My Hotrod' (best CD maxi-single of all time) ... all for $24.10? That's right: nowhere!Easy Street, I dig you. I hope you can survive the download-happy MP3 generation. A hard rating maybe a lower 4 but something above OK....3.5!The record shop Easy Street records is a hip record joint that has all different types of music and a good place to find Box sets. A &#160;nice aroma of dust and Lysol &#160;greets you as you walk in the entrance. Easy Street is the place to find rare gems that are too cool for Itunes.The Cafe:Limited seating,slow service and inattentive staff but It's all worth it for a good gritty dinner meal. The Breakfest looks great that are all named after musicians like &#160;the Johnny cash special with steak,eggs and hashbrowns and the Dolly Parton that gives you Two sets of everything;eggs,pancakes and bacon for an example.I visited on St. Patty day for lunch and got the Ruben. Corn-beef that had great flavor (little rubbery at parts) with Sauerkraut and a slice of cheese between two perfectly toasted bread served with fresh cut fries.Another con is that it's a little more that I would like to pay. the Bill was over 9 dollars with tax (I only had water) Yes. &#160;I did it. 5 stars for the cafe part. &#160;Why? &#160;Was it because of the coffee?No. &#160;It's average to just OK. &#160;Better coffee elsewhere.Is it because of the servers?No. &#160;Sometimes surly, sometimes helpful. &#160;Stars were not added nor subtracted.Here's why -There are several items on the breakfast menu that are reasonably priced - two eggs, two bacon, hash browns, toast or english muffin - 4.25. &#160;Or maybe it was 4.50. &#160;It was 4 something, though - and even though it is listed as their 'lighter fare' on the menu, it's more than enough for someone like me that usually has a cup of coffee in the morning and not much else before noon.Bottom line - if you want to go out for breakfast, and you don't want to go deep into double digits when you reach for the check, go here and get the lighter fare. &#160;It really is enough food for breakfast, you hippie freak. &#160;If there is a better breakfast experience in Seattle for less than five bucks, I sure haven't found it.Five stars for the prices.Oh yeah, that just happened. Easy Street is great not only because they have food and the occasional concert but because they have a great hip-hop selection and I'm not talking about that top 40 hip-hop bullshit. New and used they pretty much always have what I'm looking for. They carry DVDs (new and used) and sell tickets to shows at various venues. While Easy Street may not be a large establishment it is ridiculously easy to lose yourself with its varied selection of music genres.I wish I could get more in depth about the food but its been about two years since I've eaten there and I can't remember what the hell I had. I do remember it being a pleasant eating experience though. Do note that it closes at a fairly early 3:00 p.m. but does open at 7:00 a.m. a great time for breakfast! I love the atmosphere in this place and it being connected to the music store really took my mind off of waiting 30minutes to be seated. It was 2pm so I was surprised by the wait. I got the Beck Omelet, its nice to find places that make a good veggie style meals. Most places just put egg, cheese, and piece of fruit on the plate and say its vegetarian. It was really good, coffee was weak - should have gotten a coke. I look forward to my next visit. The ONLY reason I gave it 3 stars and not 4 was the wait time and weak coffee. The food is good and the atmosphere makes me want to live upstairs. This was a total iPhone yelp* selection based on our location at the time and it was great! Walking in to an old school CD store (how funny does that sound?) and putting our name on the waiting list, we ran to the rock section to find our favorite artists. After a 2 minute wait, they called our name over the PA system and we were all set for a mid-morning breakfast.I have a thing about ordering something different from the people I'm with so my first choice was the Cha-Cha Chorizo which was ordered of course so I ordered the Los Lobos instead. Both of these were huge 3 egg scrambles with an inordinate amount of hash browns and literal bottomless coffee. Both dishes were delicious and hearty.The wait staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was very comfy. If you're anywhere near this area and love music and food, you cannot pass this place up. Easy Street Records is one of the best music stores I've been to in a long time - by far the best in West Seattle. The selection is enormous and the guy working there aren't annoying hipster music snobs who look like they'll spit at you should you decide to buy a Britney Spears CD. When Amazon didn't have a CD I was looking for, I had just about given up hope. I went in to Easy Street, not expecting to find it, and found not only the CD I was looking for, but many more albums from the artists. I was thrilled! The used section is really thorough as well. Killer breakfast, located inside of a record shop. &#160;I highly suggest sitting at the bar, putting on the headphones and listening to samples of music. &#160;Anything on the menu has been A+, I like hot but if something says a little spicy, it is going to be mega spicy (Tabasco, etc.) &#160;The drip coffee is awesome and will charge you like you are plugged into the wall socket, the strongest I have ever had. &#160;Staff reminds me of when I used to live on Capitol Hill, edgy and cool. &#160;The wait is worth it, just try and go early or late to avoid a 15-20 minute wait, or squeeze in at the bar as mentioned. &#160;Loud music, good food and coffee and staff that know what they are doing and are meant to be in the business of serving. &#160;One of my favorites in W. Seattle, easy to drive here if you live out of the neighborhood, parking is free so far, no meters yet. &#160;Located on the corner across from the cupcake place.
This is the yummiest, most deeeee-lish pizza I've ever had. &#160;I'm truly craving some right now.I'm a bit confused as to the Westlake Center isn't listed as a Sbarro location -- maybe because it's in the food court? &#160;Whatever. &#160;It's there. &#160;You can even call them yourself -- (206) 287-9884.First off, the slices are HUGE, and for $3! &#160;The crust isn't too thick, nor too thin, just chewy yummy goodness. &#160;The sauce tastes like they smashed fresh-picked Roma tomatoes right there on the spot, just seconds before slathering it onto the pizza crust.I've only had a few bites out of my husband's piece &#160;when we were last at Westlake (last summer), but just from those few tastes alone, I'm *still* craving a slice o' Sbarro pizza. &#160;Really. &#160;It was *that* good.Seriously, if the rush-hour drive from Duvall to Seattle weren't so heinous, I'd go there tonight and grab one or two pizzas for tonight's dinner (Pizza Night!).
I love garlic. The sauce is full of garlic. The pita is nice and appropriately soft. The people who work here are sweethearts.Unfortunately, their falafel balls are a little dry. As there's good falafel every three feet in this town, i do knock it down to four stars. Sabra's is better when they're on, but you never know whether or not Sabra's is gonna be on on any given day. &#160;The garlic chicken is the way to go, under 7 bucks for a heaping plate with saffron rice and hummus. &#160;I wish they'd shape up the falafel balls, because that would really bring it to the next level. For now, though, there's only like 90 other places to get falafel around... What I really like about this place is the "cafe" style. Just order and sit outside. I think food tastes good and everything is fresh (the vegetable part). I was kind a disappointed because I didn't see any rotating spit or the "rotating meat".I ordered beef and chicken combo but I preferred the beef. Portions are good for the price.It's really a good place when you are looking for a descent food - just grab and go. About the customer service, just tell them what you like and wait... nothing fancy.I might go back here but only during summer where I can sit down outside and relax. I am a little shocked at the reviews about nasty falafel made at Falafel King. I can appreciate a crispy falafel. I like the texture of having to work for my food a little harder than baby food. I am not a baby bird and I can chew. This is also coming from the same person who puts Snickers in the freezer for a good jaw workout.I also enjoy the garlic-filled tzatziki sauce! Who wouldn't love it other than vampires? If I am ever coming down with a cold, I eat some falafel wrapped in a delicious warm pita, get a good jaw workout and build up my immune system for the next month. No virus can survive in my body after eating at Falafel King! My paramour and I, new to the Seattle area, were searching for a good Mediterranean place to provide eats for a party this past summer. We were expecting 40-50 people. We discovered Falafel King whilst strolling around the Pike Place Market area and tried it for lunch. Modest digs, little seating, cheap prices, and really tasty food! We struck up a conversation with the proprietor, Isaac, and told him what we were thinking. He was very friendly and helpful with his suggestions, and we ended up ordering large trays of falafel, pita, hummus, tahini, chicken shwarma, and salad. They were a big hit! We got lots of compliments and questions about the food afterwards, and we were more than happy to steer our friends toward Falafel King. In fact, a friend of mine is about to cater HIS party with their food, based on our experience. And he's a longtime Seattle resident.
I was expecting a lot more given all the great reviews!I ordered the dumplings, Kung Pao Chicken and the chow mein with homemade noodles. The dumplings were pretty good but I wouldn't say they were really anything special. I didn't even eat more than a few bites of the Kung Pao Chicken. The chicken was cheap and gross and I couldn't even choke it down. The noodles were good enough, but I agree with the reviewer who thought they were a bit dry. I followed that reviewer's advice and poured my leftover dumpling sauce all over them. Once again, the chicken in the noodles was inedible and I ate around it. I was expecting to have leftovers afterwards, but I have no desire to take up space in my fridge with not very good Chinese food I won't even want to eat later. I won't be ordering again! This was a last minute desperation kind of visit. &#160;We were driving around the area looking for something to eat and nothing sounded good. &#160;Chinese food is always sort of a safe bet for us. &#160;We can usually find something that both of us will eat. &#160;We came in pretty late and thought that they wouldn't want us there but the woman who ran the spot was more than happy to have our business. &#160;She was very attentive and brought our drinks and took our order almost immediately. &#160;She then brought us out some pot stickers which were great. &#160;A very nice surprise.My chicken &amp; noodle dish was very good. &#160;It was nice and hot and not drowning in sauce. &#160;Very good and, considering the price, I thought it was a bargain. &#160;I'd love to go back here but I rarely spend time in this neighborhood. &#160;If I do end up over there, I will be there. Mandarin Chef was something I wanted to try after reading all the positive reviews on here. &#160;First off the lady working there was very kind and insisted we stay and eat instead of getting our food to-go. &#160;Also I was very happy with how clean the restaurant was inside. &#160;We ordered the chicken chow mein, sweet and sour chicken, and general tsos chicken. &#160;The food came out quickly, about ten minutes. &#160;The chow mein was mediocre...I thought the noodles were homeade? &#160;It seemed like a basic chow mein you'd get at safeway honestly, maybe I ordered the wrong one? &#160;Anyway the general tsos chicken was tasty, I ordered it spicy (level 4) the sauce was so good so I &#160;added it to the bland tasting chow mein. &#160;The sweet and sour chicken also had good flavor. &#160; Overall it wasn't the best chinese I've ever had but I would go back again.
Urbane oh Urbane, I like you, I like you. I keep on coming back! But why, oh why, are your hamburgers always overcooked? Service is great. Food is always good. My only complaint is that they have never cooked my burger the temperature I ordered it - medium. It always, always, always comes out well done. Regardless, I'll be back. I liked this place, though wouldn't say it was spectacular. Major thumbs up for my brunch - corned beef hash. Atmosphere was nice, though I agree with others that it's still very obviously a hotel restaurant. We live close-by and never dined here. &#160;So we decide to give it a try. &#160;We weren't hungry, so just entrees and desserts. &#160;:-)Wife ordered Hazelnut Crusted Trout. &#160;The crust was complicated, with good texture, flavorful, yet not over-powering the trout. &#160;The half trout is less intimidating than Steelhead Diner.I ordered Scallops. &#160;It has a nice bed of Risotto and topped with slices of foie gras , the nice citric garnish and fresh green made every bite a delight.I had Mac and Jack beer. &#160;It is standard. &#160;Wife ordered the cocktail that is Jim Beam, Orange Bitters, and Espresso syrup. &#160;It was too candy and less a cocktail. &#160;She swapped with my beer.I came here frequently for its happy hour. &#160;The drinks are very well priced and place always packed. &#160;I probably will come back more.It is a pricy place for its general setting. OK, venue is nice - typical hotel lobby/restaurant, but nice look/style. &#160;And the menu (brunch) was generous - lots of choices, reasonably priced (for downtown hotel). &#160;But the service - meh. &#160;Sloooooow and none too appologetic for it. &#160;Plus little things like the lack of the right silverware, no salt and pepper, even the coffee was cold. &#160; I hope it was an off-day for the staff - the food itself was good, but I wouldn't pay those prices again ($13-$14 for brunch entree) for that slackadasically service. I'd go back to Urbane again. &#160;As you can see by my other reviews, I love late night happy hour. &#160;I guess I just love going to bed with a full belly! &#160;We ordered the clams, flatbread, tuna, and wings. &#160;I would pass on the wings next time, but they offer a lot of wings for the money, so if you're looking for volume, its a good order.The flatbread was very good, as were the clams and tuna.The rest of the food was good. &#160;Pricing was moderate...not the cheapest, but not the most expensive late night happy hour prices.Because I love the hotel and building, and the food was worth returning, I'd do happy hour there again. I'm so happy Urbane exists so close to where I live for several reasons: it's close to where I live, it has an AMAZING happy hour (food-wise that is, but the drink specials are pretty a-ok too, though limited), it has a variety of tasty options for both lunch and dinner and bar bites, and it's never to crowded to find a seat (yet, anyway). It's a great location even if I didn't live two blocks away, located near Pacific Place, whose food options are disappointing, and near the Paramount if you're catching a show. It isn't often that a hotel restaurant boasts anything more than over-inflated prices and reheated fancy food, but Urbane offers delicious fare for all tastes and appetites. Great! I'm a little torn between giving them 4 or 5 stars, so I've settled on 4 stars. &#160;The food itself doesn't necessarily blow you away, but the experience in its entirety has always been good: food, ambiance, service, value, ... PLUS they work with local sustainable socially conscious ingredients. &#160;Support your local socially conscious businesses. &#160;You won't regret it, ever.I've been here many times and we've always had impeccable service here. &#160;The food's always been very good - I've even done Thanksgiving dinner here (having traditionally been family-less on that day). &#160;Came here on a girls' night too with my other fellow foodistas. &#160;Their meat dishes are awesome. &#160;Any of their desserts with the word crumble has always blown me away. &#160;Last year, they had this pear crumble that was to DIE FOR - please bring it back again. great happy hour menu selection.i like the breakfast menu though a little priceyi would definitely come back. My dad, brother, and I meet here a couple of times a month for happy hour and a nosh. Very stylish and comfortable atmosphere. The help is very friendly and prompt, but what really makes this place are the prices. The happy Hour menu offers a fine variety of noshes all in their farm to market philosophy, I had an excellent lunch experience at Urbane with coworkers. The food is delicious and comes in huge portion sizes. Their half sandwiches are seriously as big as most restaurants' full sandwiches. I like their concept of local, organic, made from scratch food, too. This isn't a requirement in any way for me but if the restaurant has good service and delicious, well priced food, I think it's a plus. Their sides are great for sharing; I hear that the french fries come in a mountain big enough for a whole table to share. I really like their dressing, especially the ranch that the onion rings come with. It's a great flavor combo. Mac and cheese plus a side salad was the perfect amount of food for me.An added plus to this restaurant is that one time someone I know borrowed a wine bottle opener from them for an evening event in another building. The employee who lent it to her was really accommodating and didn't even accept collateral when offered.Haven't been there for anything but lunch, so I can't comment on drinks or dinner. A group of friends and I came here after work one evening, and we were pleasantly surprised. Most downtown happy hours seem to vibrate between mini pizzas and deep-fried spring rolls, so it's nice to see a place with a great, locavore / slow food oriented happy hour. The place looks really cool; all sorts of semi-private little tables, a very soothing modern decor - and it never got very loud, so it's possibly a good date spot. Everything we had was good - the caramelized onion flat bread, Caesar salad, cheese plate, stuffed peppers, roasted garlic bulb. What really stands out as delicious, though, were the handmade shoestring fries and from-scratch ketsup. Along with a superb cucumber-ginger mojito. Looking forward to going back and having dinner some night. We went there with a pretty big group last week and all brought wine. &#160;Our server was great about this (have had some grumpy servers when we bring our own wine) and brought out decanters and wine glasses for each bottle. &#160;She was friendly and attentive the whole meal and even took a couple pictures of our group. &#160;The food was really salty and that kind of makes it hard to give this place better than three stars. &#160;The food looked great (and nice size portions) but the salt dominated. &#160;We tried a couple cocktails and they were really good...I would give the cocktails a five star rating. Urbane was another of my Restaurant Week visits back in April. This time, the husband and I were joined by The Cousin, a gluten-Intolerant foodie. Wine+Beer: Good wine list, cool bar, great beer choices.Starters: I got a beet salad, which was significant in its beet content and therefore good. The Husband ordered steamed mussels, and The Cousin got grilled octopus with chickpeas. Everyone liked everything -- Cousin and Husband traded seafoods with one another and concur that both dishes were well-cooked.Entrees: The Husband ordered what might be the most manly meal of his life in the Pork Shank with Maple Glaze. He rarely eats pork, so his enjoyment of this dish with a fine glass of porter is a testament to how good it was. The Cousin and I both got the Seared Halibut with Carrot Emulsion and Hazelnut Crust. This dish now comes with pea vines, but we had a different green back in April. Either way, the crusted fish and carrot emulsion are what this dish is all about. Great balance of flavors, not too herbaceous, and great play of textures between the crunch of the crust, the flakiness of the fish and the smoothness of the carrot puree.Desserts: My favorite RW dessert was had here in the warm rhubarb cobbler. I think this was an RW special, as it seems they have a different rhubarb concoction on the menu now. The Husband had creme brulee, while The Cousin got an order of some other special, melty ice cream and fruit thing. All were good, but mine was the best.Portion size is a big deal for me, and I thought Urbane had excellent portion sizes for all of its dishes. I left feeling full, but not overstuffed -- and I was able to clean all of my plates. Good times. Was very pleased with the quality and taste of items ordered. Everything was so fresh and flavorful. I have been to this location before for happy hour several times and it wasn't bad. &#160;However, for a pre-fixed menu on New Year's Eve I was disappointed. &#160;It's pre-fixed so the staff and kitchen should have been prepared. &#160;Instead we got slow service (wasn't very busy), a staff that kept mixing up food allergy information (noted on opentable and informed to staff numerous times during service). &#160;The food portions for our larger group of 12+ was all over the place. &#160; So some received a decent portion and others got a tiny cut. &#160;This lead to the requested steaks being over cooked. &#160;Even the plating was off with the table service sliding the food all over when serving. &#160;For a pre-fixed and holiday menu they did a poor job on execution. &#160;I think I'll stick with happy hour and not come back for dinner service. SO disappointed with the late night happy hour food here. &#160;We had the:MAC' N CHEESE with beecher's cheese curds - $3 - pretty much flavorless. &#160;Big let-down since I love the mac and cheese at Beecher's actual Pike Place store. &#160;SEARED ALBACORE with fennel confit- $5 - this was our favorite dish of the bunch, the albacore was perfectly seasoned and cooked. &#160;But the accompanying fennel was limp and oily.GNOCCHI in brown butter- $5 - this is a side dish available on the dinner menu, it was just ok, pretty bland.Service was fine, the restaurant was pretty and laid-back. &#160;I wanted to like this place more, the menu looks so promising, but the food proved to be underwhelming. We contacted Urbane last minute after a conflict with Suite 410 and asked if they could accommodate 25-30 on a Saturday evening. After negotiating with the manager, they were able to take care of us in the wine/coffee bar, which was slightly peculiar but worked. They made an exception to serve us until 1:15am instead of their usual 12:00 closing time. The drinks were good, service was pleasant and I really appreciated them saving the night. &#160;I can't wait to go back to try the food! Went here tonight for the 1,000 Open Table points -- they should have given me 10,000. The wine list is not impressive. The restaurant layout is poorly designed and has the sound of a sports bar (extremely loud). The food ... oh, the food. My Caesar salad had virtually no flavor (no garlic or lemon tang to the dressing) and the bacon was chewy; thank goodness for the Parmesan. Next I had the French Onion Soup -- unfortunately among the worst I've had -- the broth was greasy and had an overreduced/burnt taste; hard to achieve, but the broth was this one-note flat bitterness. Next I ordered the Dungeness crab legs with garlic aioli. Prior to the delivery of this course, we literally asked our server whether there was a plastic place mat on fire -- there was this artificial odor permeating the dining room. The server told me "no, that 's your crab cooking." Yikes ... double yikes when the dish came out. It was a snarl of crab pieces which had been burned black (literally) over a gas grill (!?) -- I did try a piece of crab ... it was flavorless, dry and stringy and when I tried to pick crab out, the bitter burnt char from the crab shell flaked off onto the crab meat. Sent it back -- they gave me a crab cake instead, which was also flavorless (although the tomato chutney which came with it was good - the best thing I had all night). My husband liked his butter lettuce salad and the fig raviolis with chanterelle mushrooms (the latter of which, however, were mushy from being overcooked). He also ordered the seared sea scallop with apple slaw -- he said the scallop was well-cooked but that the combination of the largish julienne of apple with nothing else really to make it a "slaw" and tie it in with the scallop didn't work well. Our server was wonderful. &#160;However, overall, there are so many better places to eat in Seattle. Probably won't go back. Great stop downtown for Zoe meat inspired sandwiches and great breakfast combos. Keep an eye on the staff it ranges from the rude to the friendly. The food has been consistently good over 3 visits and the focus on using local vendors really makes you want to eat there more. Be specific when you order cocktails. They need some guidance. I ate breakfast here late Sunday morning. It is an appealing setting with nice upholstered chairs and the food was pretty good but service was &#160;disappointing. I am sympathetic to staff that is dealing with lots of customers but not when the place is nearly empty. We were seated relatively quickly but despite the restaurant being less than half full, no one came by for at least 5 minutes. No coffee, no water, no contact. Finally the waiter came by and we had already decided what we wanted to order. The coffee took another five minutes and the food was even slower. The staff seemed completely bored and uninterested in doing anything more than required. Different people came by at different times and after almost 10 minutes (with not even the coffee yet) the manager came by to ask if our order had been taken. We said it had so he disappeared as if everything was cool. I could like this place for breakfast but not without a better service. I might give it another try but it is not going to be high on my list. Maybe we just came by on an off day. The food at Urbane was excellent. I ordered the pork shank with huckleberry and maple glaze that was fall-off-the-bone tender, juicy, and altogether satisfying. The roasted cauliflower with butter and golden raisins was just as delicious. The rustic bread with homemade butter, with those irresistible whipped peaks, was a nice way to start while I waited on my meal. The presentation for both the entree and the side was simple yet elegant. I was surprised that the price of the entire meal was extremely affordable: $31 for a full-size entree, a side, and a glass of wine. It also helped that I went during happy which meant that the wine I was drinking was only half-price. &#160;The service during dinner was very good as well. &#160;Late night:I went back the next night to the bar area to try the pear cardamon crisp served with vanilla ice cream. &#160;The different textures and layers of flavors in the dessert played together beautifully. &#160;Although the almonds were too big for my taste, they added yet another layer of texture and a nice nuttiness. &#160;The service at the bar was not friendly and my server continued to forget the sugar that I had asked for me hot tea. &#160;Breakfast:The ricotta pancakes lightly dusted with powdered sugar and served with maple syrup were a definite winner for me. &#160;The service was not amazing but it was not bad either. &#160;A happy medium to the previous two instances. I wasn't sure what to expect and this was a Restaurant Week visit. &#160;I am notorious for ordering off the specials for these events, but I stuck to the offerings this time.Sort of elegant, with lots of spacing between seating inside. &#160;It was much smaller than I envisioned from the outside. &#160;We were seated immediately and the staff was on us. &#160;Since we decided to stick to the fixed prixe, we were quick to order. &#160;The pork shank was huge and combined with the mashed, quite tasty. &#160;My friend ended taking half of it home for the next day. &#160;I was really looking forward to the short ribs and spaetzle, but was disappointed. &#160;It was a goodly portion, but dry and wasn't exactly bursting with flavor. &#160;I ordered a couple of sides, kale and lentils. &#160;The lentils were overly minty and somewhat disappointing. &#160;The kale was too liberally sprinkled with lemon and was almost biting. &#160;Disappointing. &#160;The best part of this meal was the service. $3 mac and cheese, $5 wagyu sliders and $3 beers? &#160;Happy Hour at Urbane is a beautiful thing, especially if one is making their way to the Paramount afterwards, can't beat it for quality/location/price. &#160;Now the mac and cheese wasn't quite as intensely cheesy and it could've been and the sliders were on the salty side but, as my fianc&#233; is want to tell me, I can be overly picky. &#160;The fish and chips was great, cod was fluffy on the inside, crispy on the exterior. &#160;Service was a bit slow to start, but not annoyingly so, overall I was quite happy and this is now my go to pre-paramount spot, at least for early shows. Did someone say beecher's mac &amp; cheese?? Yes oh yes!I noticed the Urbane happy hour menu, and realized I had to give this place a try. Whoever runs their Twitter account recommended I make reservations for the Wednesday happy hour, so I did... and later found that it wasn't necessary that day. Oh, well. Better be safe than have to wait! (It got mostly full towards the end of happy hour and for dinner, but there were plenty of tables at 5pm.)The sliders were not nearly as delicious or satisfying as I was hoping they would be. The seared albacore and herb fries were pretty tasty, however, so I was happy. That mac &amp; cheese, though... that was definitely their shining star. I've had that dish at several different restaurants before and this was the FIRST time I've truly enjoyed it and found it "special" enough to order again.A nice bonus? The draft beers are only $3 during happy hour AND they're huge! Oh and cool looking modern bathrooms. (Hey, cool bathrooms are a good thing to have.) I was here recently for a date.It's a little on the "sterile" side. It's modern decor. The service is fantastic and friendly. The food was decent. Large portions, which was unexpected! Im not sure if I'd try it again1/2 doz OYSTERS - $12 - small oysters!GRILLED ALBACORE - $21 - great, light.SNAKE RIVER FARMS PORK SHANK - $21 - a little too sweet for me I was here on my post call day where sleep deprevation was slowly kickin in. &#160;Went to meet a friend who I haven't seen in &#160;years so smiling already.  &#160; Well as for the astmosphere I beleive you can't beat it for any city lunch place. The building itself is blue with plenty of windows which makes it seem as though it was built to welcome spring and summer. &#160; &#160; The menu had a classy touch with a stiff board with their logo.  &#160; &#160;The staff is awesomely friendly and prompt. &#160; &#160;As for the food... well I tried the lamb burger. But after reading Thy R's review... wonder if I should of tried the burger with the egg in it. Cuz.... the lamb burger made me wonder if I didn't like lamb or if it was the seasoning. slightly on the spicy and gamier side of lambs that I tried.  &#160; &#160;But yeah... it's an awesome place to sit and just catch up in the city. Far enough from main stream where you can't people watch but... yet city like enough makes you feel like urbanized!!! ha ha Benedict, benedict, benedict....Mmm.My man walked me down to Urbane for a brunch surprise today, and I arrived excited and left happy. Success! I've always eyed the menu here, and from the reviews wasn't sure what to expect (service issues? underwhelming food?). But he knows I'm a lover of all things local/sustainable, and his intuition was just right.The atmosphere feels a bit cold and manufactured, but I've never been in a hotel restaurant that didn't feel like a hotel restaurant so that wasn't a surprise. It was nice to have the massive windows letting in what light there was this drizzly morn. Our server was excellent: very friendly and welcoming, with good suggestions about the menu if we wanted any.Now, I am a lover of eggs benedict. Urbane has three versions on the menu: a traditional with Kurobuta ham, a smoked salmon, and a dungeness crab. Ham was all I needed to see....They arrived in their lovely stack: English muffin, ham, poached egg, and a generous pour of hollandaise with a side of potatoes and a little cup of tomato-onion jam. And were lovely. The egg yolks were verging on orange (always an excellent sign of a tasty egg and well-nourished hen), and the hollandaise was lightly flavorful and not heavy. Need I even say anything about the ham: Kurobuta! Although Dahlia Lounge has the best benedict in town, this is a close second and I was thrilled to have it. My man had a simple grilled cheese and soup, and the grilled cheese came with the two halves stacked, thick slices of bread with tasty whispers of cheese between. The potato leek soup was a bit thin for my taste, but had the rare heavy-on-the-leek flavor that made it a bit interesting.I'm sure we'll be back, at least for brunch. Dinner entrees look a bit pricey to me, unless they're entirely amazing, but those eggs and ham were too good to stay away from. If only I could get them at happy hour.... I had a very pleasant stay at The Hyatt at Olive 8, the restaurant's parent hotel. Happily, this means I had a very pleasant breakfast at Urbane!Short and sweet: super clean; polite, attentive service; well-planned menu; delicious, fresh food. I would definitely go back :) Excellent breakfast spot! &#160;Pretty crowded when I arrived around 8 am, &#160;I received great service from Amy. &#160;The French Toast is absolutely FABULOUS - and I was stuffed after I finished.....the bacon was great (but how could it not be?).Friendly, fast, efficient.Yum!1 French Toast &#160; 11.751 Bacon &#160; 4.001 Hot Tea &#160; 4.501 Juice &#160; 4.001 Coffee &#160; 3.50*** &#160; (I don't drink coffee)Total - $30.53** &#160;**this would be an expensive breakfast for 1, but it is FREE for diamond members I was here for lunch...Ambiance and service is great. I'm not really into burgers but W-O-W. I like egg a LOT. Their burger has egg, sausage, etc. A lot of things going on. Great.I'll come back again here just for their burger. Simply the best. Amazing. While my parents were visiting from out of town, we decided to go out to breakfast at Urbane. &#160;It was not crowded on a Saturday morning (a definite plus), and everything we ordered was excellent. &#160;I can definitely recommend the Florentine Scramble (eggs scrambled with chanterelle mushrooms, spinach, goat cheese, and pesto, served with potatoes and toast) . &#160;Everything was really fresh, and I appreciate that they make an effort to use food from local farmers. &#160;The service was good (my coffee cup was never left empty)- and the ambiance was pleasant. &#160;I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Urbane- but if you're looking for a good breakfast spot downtown on the weekend- give it a try! Mediocre for the price. At the base of the Grand Hyatt this is a spot that I frequent regularly due to having friends live in the Olive 8. &#160;Staff is always helpful and accommodating. &#160;Always nice to walk in and be recognized and greeted with a smile. &#160;I usually order off the Bar menu and share several different items. &#160;The go to items are the sliders, mac-n-cheese, Hummus plate and Caesar salad. &#160;They have a great selection of beer and full bar.The decor is very upscale, lots of glass and swanky furniture although you will never feel under dressed if you walk in with jeans and a t-shirt.I will definitely be going back frequently. Hip, modern, trendy restaurant attached to the Hyatt Olive 8 in downtown Seattle. &#160;Excellent food, great portions. &#160;The French toast tasted like it had been cooked in a cast-iron skillet, nice and crunchy on the outside, soft inside. &#160;Topped with roasted fruit and powdered sugar, and real maple syrup----how can you go wrong?! &#160;The eggs were excellent, and my friends gave two thumbs up to the thick-sliced sourdough grilled cheese sandwich and tomato bisque soup. &#160;Not nearly as pretentious as it looks on the outside. &#160;Hip but comfortable, no attitude. LOVELY PLACE. They're located right under the Olive 8 hotel. The interior looks really classy, and I love the street view you get when seated.We made it just in time for happy hour, and the waitress was very accommodating. We ordered some normal things but also went out of our way to try the rabbit and ...some kind of burger. Everything was amazing! Super good food for a super reasonable price (as far as happy hour is concerned). This place has literally moved up on one of my top favorite happy hour places to go, second only to 'The List' in Belltown. My husband and I attended the DeLille Cellars Winemaker's Dinner event last night with two other friends to celebrate our wedding anniversaries and our love of good food and good wine and each other. The menu was excellent - props to the Chef!On the organizational side however, there was a bit of a snafu with our reservations, their credit card authorization forms for advance payment and our discount applied on the tab when it came time to pick up the tab, making it not such a pleasant experience to end a nice splurge dinner on such a special occasion. &#160;I do hope these issues get solved for future large group events similar to this Winemake's Dinner.Cheers. I went there today with my coworkers and we had a really great lunch. I had the grilled cheese and carrot soup combo for $11. The waitress was so friendly and she kept our water bottle filled the entire time. I would have given this place 4 stars, however there was the strongest bleach smell in the air. My coworkers have been before and they said it always smells like that. I hope that they do something about it, because the people that came in after us said the same thing to the hostess. The interior design is so great as is the food, I hope they can work on the bleach thing soon. :) My friend and I had a girls lunch here. &#160;We really enjoyed ourselves. It is a beautful restaurant, and the service was excellent. When we ordered wine by the glass, and they were out of it, they gave us TWO glasses to taste. &#160;Nice service.I had the carrot soup with grilled cheese using Beecher's cheese, my friend had the heirloom tomato salad and the corn soup. &#160;The heirloom tomato salad was a bit small for my liking, but she enjoyed it.Really, our section of downtown/First Hill was missing a nice lunch spot for business or a fancy lunch. &#160;I will defintely come by again. &#160;The prices were very reasonable for lunch. Short rib sliders, mac and cheese, and onion rings rounded out our night in Seattle. &#160;Nice ambiance for a night out. As I had originally feared, and hoped very much to be in vain, Urbane is starting to get a little greedy and go a little downhill. The sides have increased in price twice since they opened, and their selection is thinning out. The Gnocchi and Sweet Onion Risotto are notably absent from the menu now, in favor of lower quality, less filling stuff. I can still spend $11 on an amazing hamburger (with a pile of delicious pickles) and enjoy the food, but am starting to feel a little squeezed toward settling for french fries instead of more wholesome, satisfying tidbits for my $10. Pity. Another night, another restaurant.I was meeting friends for dinner and drinks, so we decided to check out Urbane @ Olive8 since it was on the restaurant week list.My first thought when walking into this cute lounge restaurant was that it reminded me of a swanky bar that you would find in New York City. It had that feel to it. You would never know it existed because the signs for the restaurant are so subdue that you could walk right by not noticing it at all.I get to the bar and the bartender is right there to get your drink order, no waiting what so ever which is always a plus in my book. They were very friendly.Once a table opened for us we were seated and waited on right away.I ordered the leek and potatoes soup as my appetizer. The soup itself was simple yet delicious. For my entr&#233;e I chose the braised pork shank, It was soo yummy. The meat just fell off the bone. It was very moist and very well seasoned. The glaze on it only complimented with the side of mash potatoes. I chose the butterscotch ice cream for dessert. I've had better ice cream so that was just okay by me.Overall my experience was great but the food did take some time to come to us. We noticed even though we were caught up in conversation and if that happens you know that is way to long of a wait if the topic turns to "where is our umm food?" Another annoyance of mine was that the waitress cleared my soup without asking if I was finish which I wasn't. I let it slide because the entr&#233;e definitely made up for it any how.I minus a star because of the hiccup with my appetizer and also the long wait on the food but all in all I would definitely come back to this place for food and drinks. The bar itself was a win in my book.Cons: Parking since it is in downtown it can be hard to find street parking and the garages or lots can be pricey.Pros: great ambiance and very posh. plus great food! So it sounds like Urbane can be completely hit-or-miss on service depending on when you go, and who your server is. We always seem to have good luck, so we keep going back. I went here for the first time for work, with our contact from the Seattle Convention and Visitor's Bureau.Today the SO and I went here for Brunch/Lunch. We really like the way the restaurant looks, which is a surprise since it is attached to a Hyatt. Some call it spare or sterile, but we think it just looks clean and modern. There were some oddly rowdy guys at the bar for being 1:00pm on a Sunday, but there was a football game on at the bar.I started with the Potato and Leek Soup, which I expected to be chunky and thick (I guess more like a chowder). It was kind of one-note, and I had to add both salt and pepper.I ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich, which is great, but gigantic! It is more of a knife-and-fork sandwich. My husband ordered the English Style Turkey Club Sandwich which he really enjoyed. The sandwich has two eggs over-easy/fried which make it really moist. We also ordered the Mac and Cheese (with Beecher's curds!) and french fries. Note: the side orders are huge! Definitely share these. This is a good excuse to order more than one, because they are always so good.I highly suggest this restaurant, with their seasonal, locally-sourced menu. I didn't expect much, but I was surprised at how good Urbane was. &#160;The atmosphere didn't really work for me. &#160;The restaurant was surprisingly loud, despite it's small size. &#160;The food, however, was excellent. &#160;Service was also competent. &#160;I find myself with little to complain about other than the ambiance. Urbane's menu reminded me a lot of Purple Cafe's. But the interior was by far one of the most gorgeous restaurants I've been in.I'm a huge fan of the really urban and chic decor and layout. Everything feels very modern and clean inside and it's pretty much what I want my future home to look like.Aside from aesthetics, the food was quite delish as well. I ordered the salmon salad while my friend had the grilled cheese and tomato soup. We also shared skinny fries that came with the homemade ketchup. Wow. It was amazing!The service was great as well and I really hope to go back soon to check our their dinner options or something. Yay!
Okay so... best for delivery or take-out &amp; mostly good food?The location was simple and small, but comfortable and convenient enough. Perhaps a bit loud because of the kitchen, but I got better at ignoring the noise as we got our food.The service was pretty good. I think he re-filled our waters 3-4 times!The Tom Kha Gai (soup) was delicious, the Pineapple Curry was great, the Summer Asparagus special was okay, and the Prik Pao noodles were pretty good.The rice, however, was quite bad and my boyfriend wondered if it had been the stuff scraped from the bottom of a rice cooker (or something along those lines).I think next time I'll go for take-out or delivery instead of eating in... and maybe order something that doesn't require rice. The curry was the best dish and I'm hoping the rice was a fluke, but... I'm a little weary of getting bad rice again. Great lunch specials! &#160;For only $7 you get your main dish, jasmine rice, tofu phad thai, and a salad. &#160;Definitely a lot of food for your money.Very quick service on take out! Solid Thai food... made by Indonesians. &#160;Good stuff.It's one of those typical, little, lack-of-decor joints. The staff are friendly. The food is above average. The menu is medium-sized. Thank heavens for Krua Thai - we moved to the north end recently and this will become our new favorite spot!Portions are excellent &amp; the recipes are rich and genuine. Phad thai with scallop, yum neur beef salad and rangoons were all divine!Fantastic value, served with aloha. &#160;If you enjoyed Siam on Broadway (Rest in Peace), you need to come and grind at Krua. I like this place. I like eggplant in my curry (THEY PUT MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF EGGPLANT IN THEIR CURRY!), and the food is prepared quickly for my tired, take out dependent ass (diets can suck a phat one). Definitely worth the drive from Northgate when a 40 hour workweek working for dear ol' Uncle Schultz makes you not want to cook ! I usually get take out, because whenever I dine in, I find that there's yet another Windermere mother complaining about how Pedro and Ma&#250;el theoretically messed up her lawn. I'm not placing that on the wonderful cooks. They are awesome. This is a cute place that I've consistently ordered out from for the past couple of years. The menu is decently sized and the food is definitely delicious. As other reviewers have mentioned, its not the best dine-in place as the decor is pretty limited and the space is small, but the service is always prompt and friendly. I have yet to be disappointed Finally found a truly authentic Thai joint in all of Seattle! My Thai colleague is from Northern Thailand, and she told me this place makes really authentic cuisine similar to her hometown's. &#160;Ask for the "Thai menu" which is basically a list of their specialties. &#160;From that menu, I had the Northern style sausage and the stir-fried curry w/ seafood (forgot the exact name, but it was the first one on the list). My girlfriend always has to get a phad (thai, kee mao or siew ew) &#160;at a Thai restaurant, so we got the phad kee mao. Wow! The noodles were the best I've had in Seattle. Pretty darn close to how they do it in Thailand. The ingredients blend together so well. Most Thai places have their salts, sweets and spices just basically doing their own thing, but here, they all bring harmony to our mouth. The seafood curry was my favorite, definitely recommend it. &#160;Didn't seem like they used cheap, instant curry. The sausage was very unique and quite crispy. Lovely! I'll have to come back!
I went here with the m-squad (Maria, Michael and Mitzie) &#160;and the new Ian (Ian L) and I could not have had a better time with better food! &#160;i got the gang --- curry and the king avocado curry. &#160;To be honest, the king avocado curry, though grandiose in name, was not that great. &#160;It was good, but not incredible. &#160;The gang curry, was, however, muy excillente. &#160;One point you must consider is that before having Kaosamai, I had Theo's chocolate. &#160;I thought that it would be impossible to eat something after Theo's because my taste buds would have been forever skewed. BUT the gang curry goodness made me realize that i could enjoy food other than chocolate. &#160; Also, besides them being cool and splitting the check, they also serve brown rice!!! YAY FOR BROWN RICE!! it made me feel semi-healthy. &#160;post Theo and gang and king crab curry. &#160;It is def. worth every penny!! Eh. &#160;I tried a couple items here that I've had at lots of thai places in town. &#160;I'm not sure what was going on here this day, but the staff was notably annoyed to have customers. &#160;I think it was part of the family that runs the place, so I guess it's their prerogative if they want to be dicks, but I don't have to love it. &#160;I can also write about it on Yelp.So after being dumped into a table in an empty restaurant on an afternoon without a word and left to sit while the staff was out of sight off doing something else, I was able to have a sunny chat with whomever I was with at the time. &#160;My lunch socializing was eclipsed by the annoyed service, mediocre thai, and generally unfavorable time.I'd stick with the place across the street. &#160;It's Kwanjai and Thai Tom for me in this town so far. Due to the awesomeness of the deck, the friendliness of the service, and the spiciness of the food, I will now make Kaosamai my "go-to gal" for Thai food. She's a peach. Which is what kept me away, initially. I used to drive by thinking...my god! The garish colors! Don't they know you only paint things that bright if you live in certain parts of Latin America or the Netherlands Antilles? But I got over myself after reading a bunch of Yelp reviews, and decided to give it a try. Thanks, Yelpers, for helping me keep an open mind about the paint job on my dining establishment. Because the off-putting exterior couldn't be farther from the "internal truth", which is that the Kaosamai kitchen has got it goin' on! I went there last weekend and ordered Tom Kha soup. Not only is tofu a protein option in just about every dish, their Tom Kha tofu was three times as rich and pleasant as the soup I usually grab at another less compelling Thai location. The soup was so good that I high-tailed it back there 5 days later just itching for K-sam to show me more. Note to anyone wanting to win me over: make sure it involves coconut milk. You can put me in a trance and make me give you the deed to my car as long as coconut milk is part of the bargain. When I come out of it, I'll call you a sucker for trying to rip off such a junker. But I digress.My next foray into Kaosamai cuisine involved some phad see iew and a green curry. Not only did the curry contain a vegetable that I only vaguely recognized and could not name (which totally impressed me...and maybe you'll think I'm a dolt, but it turned out to be Thai eggplant), but the wide rice noodles in the phad see iew kicked some rice noodle ass. They were clingy and savory and tasted like they had just had a hot 'n heavy makeout sesh with some wok smoke right before they were plated for me (and that's a good thing). They had more than just the usual broccoli involved--there were carrots present, too. And they were so darn good that we ate the whole thing.It's not often that I go home from a Thai restaurant without leftovers. The portions here were as typical as anywhere (except, perhaps, Tup Tim, which is not nearly as good but certainly more voluminous). We just licked the plates clean, that's all. And there was no shame involved. Thanks to the kickass deck, this place is the new El Chupacabra. Except the servers are eager to please. And the food actually tastes the way it's supposed to. And there is no bitchy attitude or long wait. Wait a second, it's nothing like El Chupacabra at all...it's actually GOOD! So run, don't walk, to Kaosamai the next time you're jonesin' for a little fish sauce spring in your step. And p.s.: the veggie spring rolls &amp; dipping sauce are dee-lish. I can't wait to go back for more. As I recall, two days hence, the location was convenient; the building a refitted single-family home-style affair, and inside had the familiar budgeted pan-asian trappings, a couple steps above dime-a-dozen Pho houses and a few steps below franchised Thai. We were seated quickly, a minute or two later given menus with a good variety of standard Thai fare along with some more exploratory dishes, and I ended up splitting the pineapple duck red curry and the avacado green crab curry with Rebecca L., accompanied with a side of jasmine rice. The former was definitely the favored dish, with a unique blend of savory, sweet and spice that was gone quickly compared the the latter, of which we ended up having a remainder boxed up. The duck curry could definitely earn a repeat order in the future. In the green curry's defense, it was a larger portion, but the flavors just didn't cooperate the same way. It had a heterogeneity to it that wasn't displeasing, per se, but did seem somewhat unrefined by comparison. All in all, food-wise it created an experience that did not disappoint in the least.In terms of staff, they were unobtrusive, responsive, and kept my rapidly-drained water glass refilled about 70% of the time, (which isn't easy) and also did everything expected. To conclude, I'll say this: Kaosamai did not disappoint, but the quality of the experience was such that I'd not so much seek it as perhaps stumble upon it again, most likely as a result of attending a more memorable draw, like the Theo chocolate factory tour. The fact that a bazillion other Thai places are within walking distance means that I'm probably more likely to continue searching for greener pastures, but as you pursue yours, Kaosamai is a worthy pit stop. Fremont has so many Thai restaurants to chose from and this one is my favorite! &#160;The people there are so nice and friendly - they remember you - talk about great neighborhood place. They always have parking and in the summers they have a great outdoor seating area. &#160;I suggest ordering the chicken satay with fresh cucumber salad, yellow curry or their pad thai. Their curry fried rice is also tasty. &#160;You never have to wait long and the food is fresh. Their big patio is what sold me. &#160;Lots of seating outside and even though we had 8:30 reservations (on a Friday) for outside seating, we showed up at 8 and had no problem getting a table.I had the drunken noodles (Lard Na) with Tofu, 2 stars spicey and thought it was very good. &#160;A little white rice under &#160;the noodles on the plate and it filled me up. &#160;GF had some ginger dish and thought that it didn't have any ginger falvoring, so she wasn't really a fan of Kaosamai.The service wasn't really the best, which is why I gave them only 3 stars. &#160;While they were very friendly, they didn't check on the table very often. &#160;After seating us, it took about 10 min till they returned and we ordered. &#160;I had a beer with my meal and would have had a couple more had they returned to the table after bringing out food out. &#160;I finished my first beer about half way through my main course.Overall, a nice spot on the main drag in Fremont where the food is good and there is plenty to take in (nectar next door or the bikes riding by trying to impress everyone) When a group of Yelpers decides to try a restaurant for the first time without even checking to see what other Yelpers think - now that's some out-of-the-box, adventurous dining. And it paid off. Like Michael said, the ladies were sweet and I love that separate checks were no big deal. My King Crab Avocado curry was declicious and there was a lot of it. Lots of huge chunks of crab swimming in yellow curry with green and red peppers and onions and cool avocado slices to balance the spiciness. Ok, ok, so I only order two stars spicy, I'm a wimp, I admit it. But 2 stars here is like 3 stars in other places I've been to. In fact, it was so good I may just bump up my future star orders. Unless I go back to Kasosamai, which is highly likely on a sunny day with the lure of that enormous deck. Two stars out in the Fremont sunshine should suffice. I was part of the yelp group who came in here "yelp-blind" on Saturday. &#160;Sometimes this can be a bad thing but thankfully it wasn't for us. &#160;I went simple, Guay Tiow Tom Yum soup, it was tasty and had a nice flavor to it. &#160;I asked for four stars and normally with any Thai soup it's NEVER spicy but this actually had a tiny bit of a kick to it, not four stars but at least two. &#160;Everyone's food looked great I'll for sure be going back to try the King Crab Avocado curry, of course minus the bell peppers, it looked as delicious as it sounded. &#160;The topper of the whole meal was the fact the server willingly did individual checks for all of us no questions asked, no bitching, no whining it was wonderful. Fantastic Thai Restaurant full of helpful people. Though the food was a tad spicy, it was delicious! I'll be back!
Had a tasty dinner here last night. Overall thoughts are that they are completely on the right track. This does not have the feel of a new Restaurant at all, and I will certainly be back. Here's the play by playBea's tots - these really were delicious. But, of all our dishes this was the most disappointing. There were only a dozen or so very small tots in the order. While good, not enough to warrant another order in the future. It would be great if it were doubled and even with a few other dipping sauces. Maybe curry ketchup or cheese sauce? White corn soup - melt in your mouth good! We were all fighting over the last spoon fulls. This was so well balanced and creamy, a total winClams &amp; chorizo - Yum! Very well cooked fresh clams with just the right amount of broth to go great as a dipping sauce for the grilled bread along side the dish. Bea's meatloaf - Two of us had this dish and we both really loved it. One of us (Me) being a meatloaf person, the other was not. We both found it had a very rich flavor. Thanks again, veal! We were told this was the last night they would have the meatloaf on the menu since it's warming up a bit now. I would vote to keep it on. If it's a staple and a favorite, people will still order it even in the summer. Pork tenderloin - I don't usually like pork and I was drooling over this! So tender and juicy!! Fantastic. And the poutine was SO good, I'm surprised they don't offer it solo as a starter. We shared a strawberry pie with ice cream that was also very well done. The atmosphere is kitschy and intimate. Fun wallpaper, retro tables. Most of the evening the music odd, pop 80's Hungry Like a Wolf esque songs. Didn't fit the vibe at all. Also, I would guess this place can get pretty loud if its busy. There was only one other table with us last night and the noise level got pretty high. Service was great and the drinks did not disappoint. A great up and comer! My boyfriend and I got our zipcar and headed over to the tucked away area of Madrona. The street was really cute and quiet. Restaurant Bea has a great atmosphere for a relaxed night and casual attire. The restaurant was a bit loud as you could hear clanking from across the room. It was also hard to hear the waitress.We ordered the steak and rabbit. Both were great and tasty. Though the steak was a bit garlicky, I mean taste it 5 hours later garlicky. The wine selection was good and offered a few diverse geographical options. We were not impressed with the tots, they were too breaded. Think panko crumbs, and they were over priced for the 8 we got. &#160;Good dipping sauce though. We enjoyed the My friend and I enjoyed our dinner at Bea, the latest incarnation in that location in Madrona. &#160;Moving the bar really opened up the interior, and the floral wallpaper with minty green and white tables and chairs give the space a "grandma chic" vibe. &#160;The specialty cocktails were delicious. &#160;When I did not especially care for the entree special I ordered, we were given free dessert. &#160;The restaurant had been open for less than a month when we went in, so I hope to return soon. Woo hoo. A great place to dine in Madrona that isn't crawling with kids! Victory! The food is delicious. We did a well rounded tasting of the starters, but I remember my favorite was the rabbit rillettes and the beet and arugula salad. My friends may disagree and tell you that the tots were their favorite.My husband had the rabbit and herb spaetzel which he would recommend, and I had the meatloaf (although I don't think its on the menu anymore since they're seasonal). I really liked the meatloaf, and I wasn't disappointed although I know its risky ordering something that everyone's grandma has a recipe for (and is believed to be easy). I'm still shocked that we haven't made it in for their happy hour. I'm dying to try it. Also, what's up with the table in the kitchen? I want to sit there!Final note: Sometimes I like to order a bottle of wine and I don't want to get an expensive one. We tried a few of their cheaper bottles and I really liked them, so we ordered more. Sometimes that comes back to bite you and you end up with a not-so-pleasant bottle, but it didn't here.
Great Location for a Subway! I love the fact that after a good workout in the same building as 24 Hour Fitness, I can walk over and get a sub. This Subway is never busy at night and the guy that works the night shift has been great every time that we go in. Good Food, Great Service, Perfect Location.. What more can you ask for! It's a Subway, nothing new here. However, they have a huge eating area that you don't feel rushed to leave if you need to hunker down somewhere for a while.
Good for quick fast food, but nothing really special..
Still on the same visit to Seattle. &#160;Saw that there was another Paseo by the water, so drove out there to look around as an excuse to try Paseo's 2nd shop. &#160;We got the #2, two times. &#160;See other review for Paseo #1. &#160;Cool staff, ridonculous sandwich. &#160;Awesome. Was here one week ago on a Saturday around 5pm. They ran out of bread. We ordered the chicken dinner. It was good. Only think they put too much vinegar in them. Other than that it was worth it. Will be returning to buy media noche sandwich. Still it is not that expensive and they serve a lot of rice. Gracias. November 1, 1963 Dear Mr. President, I would like to bring to your attention a domestic terrorist threat of epic proportions located just south of our boarders. A Cuban eatery known as Paseo is serving sandwiches of some bombastic fershizzilness that it threatens the very fabric of our domesticated, whitewashed, gentrified, Christian-American way of life. These are not of the garden variety, red-lamp heated, en masse made for mass consumption burgers! They're so thick you have to mash them down just to get it in your gob! And in doing so, they ooze so much pink-o, Communist juiciness it gets all over your hands and sleeves that a dozen napkins wont be enough to contain it! If we do not immediately put a stop to this eatery- Nay! a sanction on that country as a whole! we run the risk of our children and countrymen becoming torn from the very bland sameness-ness that unifies this great land! Imagine an America free of cookie-cutter homes, eerily similar fast-food chain restaurants with clown-based gimmicks and strip malls! The horror! This is a matter of utmost urgency, Mr. President! Holla back! Sincerely, R. McDonald P.S. Texas is wonderful this time of year! The southern hospitality will blow your mind! MMMMM scallop sandwich!! &#160;MMM!!! &#160;I think it's even better than the pork!!!! &#160;And there wasn't a line like in Fremont. &#160;And they weren't out of bread in the evening!! &#160;And you can take the juicy deliciousness down to Golden Gardens to devour the whole messy thing.MMMMM. So why bother with another one? There isn't too much to add to the over 500 reviews for Paseo and there's a picture with the menu here. Oh, I suppose with the demise of the Seattle PI, there's a dearth of investigative reporting around the city. I could take soil samples and comment on the mercury and lead levels around Paseo.But since I'm a lazy creature at heart that would rather be lying on a poolside barca lounge with a margarita than do research, that's not going to happen. However, just like how every band somehow seems compelled to redo a classic (Joy Division covers? C'mon.), I feel driven to write a Paseo review. So here's a few anecdotes which may help explain why you should get a Paseo sandwich:-I only drink water with a Paseo sandwich so there's nothing that will interfere with the taste.-The last time I was here, I'd decided to make this the endpoint of a long run and figured I'd walk home and munch on a sandwich. So I went up to the line and waited patiently, bobbing my head a little to the music on my headphones, sort of like a Muppet. A sweaty, hungry Muppet. After placing my order, I'd moved to the side of the stall and watched the seagulls streaking across the bay. The wind was sweeping up and wafted the scent of the Paseo grill over to me. The smell is almost better than the sandwich itself, like the smell of a county fair to a kid (but without the wet sheep). When I went up to get my sandwich I asked them if they had considered a Paseo air freshener. You know, something you could plug in at home or put on the rear-view mirror of your car. I thought it might be a dumb question, but he looked at me and said "actually, we get that all the time."-Once I showed up at Paseo in January to find out that they were still closed. I was standing there motionless, rain streaming down my face, and for at least a few seconds considered quitting my job and becoming a Paseohead. I could live in a tent next to Paseo and make a living off handouts, selling t-shirts and doing puppet shows. And eat daily sandwiches.-Instead of cologne, I save the juice from the sandwiches and........ Paseo rocks! Midnight cuban roast sandwich is a staple for me. &#160;Chicken dinner and fish bowl or sandwich is also delicious! Glad that there are 2 locations - the wait can be long - Go early before they run out of sandwiches... good sandwiches. spicy. I like to have a cup of milk handy. :) I was sceptical about another Paseo opening that I didn't want to admit that it might be the same or better as my usual haunt. &#160;I mean when you have found perfection how can you repeat it.Anyway same great menu and same great food...only without the insanely long lines. &#160;So yeah awesome! Nom, nom, nom; this place is fabulous! &#160;I had the pork shoulder sandwhich, on a baguette, with (was it?) aioli. &#160;It was to die for. &#160;I just wish we had one of these in San Diego. &#160;Seattle is at a loss for edible Mexican food, maybe we could broker a trade? &#160;I'll give you five Los Pancho's for one Paseo... I was staying with friends at Hostel Seattle down the block -- we had arrived exhausted &amp; hungry after a bus ride from Vancouver, and we were desperate for some tasty food. &#160; &#160;We had no idea what we were in for!My husband &amp; I split the Midnight Cuban Press &amp; the West Carribean Bowl, and we were thrilled. &#160;The sandwich was hands-down one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life, greasy with grilled onions, mayo, cheese, banana peppers &amp; meat. &#160; They have a similar vegetarian pressed sandwich that my friends ordered, and they were ooh-ing and aah-ing over their sandwich as well. &#160; The West Carribean Bowl was like chicken &amp; rice + nachos... so delicious! The service was quick (and I was paying close attention to this because I was starving &amp; grumpy), and they provided us with huge stacks of napkins... we needed them all to clean up after the messy sandwiches. :-) It was my last day in Seattle. Did I hang out with friends?Spend time with loved ones?Focus on what was really important?Yes, I did all three. If you consider the grilled pork sandwich from Paseo an important friend of the family. &#160;With my priorities clearly set straight I swung by the newest Paseo and ordered up a grilled pork sandwich. Took it down to Golden Gardens where I wolfed down the delicious mayonnaise covered sandwich and shed a tear for all that I would miss about the emerald city. Clearly I'll be back. As many people have already attested, Paseo has wonderful sandwiches, particularly what used to be called the Midnight Cuban. &#160;They've changed the name (don't know why), but it's the same delicious pulled pork sandwich served with garlic mayo, lettuce, fat (meaning size) grilled onions, and jalapeno slices.Tips:If you want a sandwich, get there early -- say around lunch time, as they do run out. &#160;They get their bread from a local bakery, and only order so many -- I don't know why they don't order more, since they frequently run out, but they don't. &#160;Rather than go sandwich-less, I just go there earlier in the day. &#160;Many times I'll just call ahead and pay/pick up the sandwiches 15 minutes later.If you eat in, you get a corn on the cob with your sandwich. &#160;If you get sandwiches to go, by default they don't come with the corn. &#160;Not sure why -- maybe it's like some Japanese restaurants that don't include miso soup when you order to go, even though you get it if you eat in the restaurant -- but the solution is simple. &#160;Just say "I'd like the corn" when you order your to-go sandwich(es).They only take cash, so make sure you have some before you make your way there. &#160;The sandwiches are under $7, maybe this is what keeps them reasonably priced. &#160;Again, a small inconvenience for one of the best sandwiches EVAH.If you like added spice, ask for a side of habanero oil. &#160;It provides a good kick though, so be warned! &#160;But it's delish. Just as good as the other but with NO WAIT !!XOXOXO The only reason I don't give this a 5/5 is because I didn't get the corn with my midnight cuban!!! The taste is just as immaculate as the Fremont location, I found myself devouring it too quickly just because I was so excited. I need to pace myself in order to get the full satisfaction.One thing that was great about this location was that there was no line in obtaining my food. I came on a Saturday right around lunch time and expected a wait but there was none! While this may be Paseo's second, newer location, Paseo is not the second coming.Repeat after me: Paseo is not the second coming.Paseo makes an excellent Cuban-inspired sandwich that resembles a burrito in girth and consumption approach, with perhaps the best carmelized onions I've ever had. If you've never tried either a Cuban Roast (#2) or, if dietary restrictions prohibit, the Tofu sandwich, you should put this on your belated New Year's Resolutions for the year - this one involves eating more, not less, so it should be easy.Paseo is not the second coming. There are a few improvements from the prior location:- proximity to Golden Gardens to eat is better than proximity to the park next to the zoo- no snaking line, subject to change once more people realize it is here come summer- a limited amount of lot parkingPaseo is not the second coming. It still has some quirks which, given their undeniable success, are somewhat baffling and/or inexcusable:- apparently their second location building must have went over budget because they still can't afford any kind of vehicle-visible signage- seating consists of several stools at the counter where one orders and two picnic tables which is less than optimal in the winter- allergy to plastic of the credit kind despite serving platters around $12Don't misunderstand: I still come here somewhat regularly despite the flaws and the distance, and I find this a great lunch spot to simultaneously impress a date and test her comfort level with the impossibility of maintaining impeccable etiquette with a large, overflowing, dripping sandwich, but it's not worthy of committing idolatry. The Midnight Cuban Pork sandwich was AWESOME! The meat was soo juicy and tender down to the last bite, all mixed with the yummy caramelized onions, parsley, banana peppers, cheese and all combined to make a good greasy sauce sandwiched in a crispy, baguette-type roll.Ok...THIS TIME I had the b@lls to introduce myself without any fear! "Is this the Yelp crowd? Hi, I'm Nori (and I'm the chicken sh!t that did not introduce myself at the SODO Showbox)". Then, Dfens read my mind and had to say it out loud! Thanks Dfens, Amanda Y. and Sean C. for making it easy, fun and relaxed atmosphere!AN ABSOLUTELY MUST GO! =) Best spot in the world for delicious sandwich (chicken). I can't wait to go to the new spot by golden gardens this summer. I will fight the gulls for every last piece. Oh. My. God. &#160;This is the best sandwich ever!I ate here for the first time today. I ordered the #2, my friend ordered the #1. We took them to the Locks for a picnic and had trouble figuring out which was which. I accidentially ate the first half of his. OH. MY. GOD. When I took a bite of the other sandwich I realized we had mixed them up. The #2, what I ordered, was still great. But the #1. . . . holy cow. &#160;We could have shared one sandwich, both of us felt like we ate an entire pig. &#160;And I think I have mayonaise in my hair. . but it was totally worth it. This sandwich drips down your arm while you eat it - ask them to cut the sandwich in half, and bring wet-naps. YUM. I-5 down to one lane, 2 1/2 hour round trip from Capitol Hill, screaming cat in the carrier, nothing good on the radio, and yet, it was TOTALLY WORTH IT. The Midnight Cuban will wash away your worries and fill your soul. Probably the best cheap eats restaurant I can rely on in Seattle (except for open times!!! I always find myself wanting to go on Sundays or Mondays). Keep doing what you're doing, oh yeah, that's it. :)Their beans and rice are uniquely mesmerizing as well as the giant savory Tiger Prawns. I try to branch out and order new things when I go, but the Prawn Sandwich is my saviour or er.. saveur YUM! When I did brave the rest of the menu I tried the cuban presse, pulled pork both delicious, of course. Next on my list is to try the Tofu. Not that my status would be anything less than devotee to Paseo, but I have as high hopes for the Tofu Sandwich.I like them spicy so I always ask for extra jalapenos. Ayee!I always say as we're leaving this place, "Paseo is the sole reason edible paper should be invented"*drool* I was a bit disappointed the first time I tried to come to Paseo in Sept. and they had run out of bread. They still had a line of loyal customers waiting the 40 min for the delivery from Fremont. Must be pretty good, eh? We didn't have time to wait around, but I have to admit it piqued my interest and I waited all winter to try it!We finally made it back over today and what a perfect day to go! Being a partial vegetarian, I was impressed the menu included a few tofu dishes. Great, crave worthy sandwich! I ordered the Chicken Breast, which was awesome. Had a bit of the "most popular" Cuban Pork and meh... the Chicken was much better. Oh! and I loved that majority of the customers were friendly and willing to share the minimal table space. Happy Seatteites doped up on Vitamin D :)Be prepared:- BRING CASH!!- Know what you want, don't hold up the line- They are messy!- It's a stand- no seating One of the few places that lives up to all the hype. &#160;Utterly fantastic sandwiches... the kind of sandwich where your GF pulls out the 3 second rule as part of her sandwich falls on the carpet. It's totally worth the hype : )I had my first Paseo experience last week and I'm already having separation anxiety from those sandwiches! &#160;After reading all the Yelp reviews, I decided on the Midnight Cuban with a side of corn on the cob. &#160; The sandwich was pretty much perfect. &#160;Meat was tender, juicy and flavorful. &#160; Bread was fresh with just the right amount of crispy exterior with a light, chewy interior. &#160; The sauteed veggies brought it all together. &#160;The corn was....ok. &#160; Yes Paseo only takes cash and yes there's only room for about 5 people to eat at this particular location. &#160;However, grab your sandwich and head down the street to Golden Gardens park and enjoy that yummy, sloppy sandwich with a great view of the ocean!Oh i'll be back to try more, no, ALL of Paseo's delicious sandwiches! This place sucks. The food's terrible. No, really. Don't go there. Total waste of time.(lame attempt to try to shorten the wait for one of the best sandwiches in Seattle) Oh, Paseo....I had waited so long to experience your raptures after hearing your lovers about town rave over and over again. The bright pink of your building called out to me after a walk with the man and the dog at Golden Gardens, the images of your food contrasting in my mind with the week's-end emptiness of my refrigerator at home."Can you pull over please?" I ask the man. "Just so I can get a sandwich for my lunch. I know you have your plans to eat a salad." He pulls in. We swing open the car doors, the chilly air redolent with garlic, nutmeg, smoke...."Hmm," he said. I dart ahead to the menu board, salivating in anticipation for my first taste. Cuban Roast. The man looks at the list. "Hmm." I am a temptress, leading others away from their Portobello salad, leading them to ruin through garlic aioli, tender spiced meat, crusty-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside baguettes and long thick strands of caramelized onion....Complete, total sandwich seduction. Paseo, you are El Diablo at the gates of the Garden, tempting me to tempt the man. I will pray for the strength to resist you tomorrow...but like St. Augustine, will hope those prayers for resistance aren't answered. Not yet.... You have NO idea how happy I am that Paseo is now in my 'hood! &#160;The food is just as delish, the lines are shorter, and the wait is next to nothing. &#160;Now I take my lovely Cuban Roast sammy down to Golden Gardens and eat it in the car, guaranteeing onions, jalapenos, and mayo all in my lap and on my steering wheel. &#160;Yippee! Love both the pork and shrimp sandwiches - excellent rice &amp; beans as well... This is the spot! Some people say the Fremont one is better, it may be the original, but the taste is the same. You will get a longer wait at the Fremont location with plenty of hipsters in line, but no benches and no views of Shilshole. Do you like well-seasoned, slow roasted pork? Check!Do you like (DELICIOUS) carmelized onions, cilantro and garlicky mayo? Check!Would you like all of those ingredients in a freshly baked roll? Check!Well, then get your booty down there! &#160;Expect a long, but fast moving line during lunch hour and don't hold your breath hoping for a seat. &#160;But, it's ALL WORTH IT!!! &#160;This is one of those places where everything on the menu is pretty damn good. &#160;You'll find yourself wondering if you should go with what you know is good, or if you should venture out and try something new. &#160;Do yourself a favor - get your old stand by and something new as well. This has got to be the best sanwich I ever had by far. &#160;Why I let time go by so long without eating there, i don't know why. &#160;I am now a slave to the number 2 sandwich. &#160;I went here thinking about getting the midnight sandwich but the counter guy told me to try the Number 2 which is the pork with jalepenos, romaine, galic mayo and grilled onions, it came with roasted corn on the cob clathered in garlic/cilantro butter.....Mother of mercy I was in la la land. &#160;I went there wednesday and had to go back on thursday and got two sanwichs (one for thurs and one for fri). &#160;I will be a regular at this place. I'm kind of in a daze.You see, I just ate a whole Midnight Cuban all by myself.The whole time I was eating it, my dog was staring at me with an angry look on his face. &#160;"How dare you eat that... and NOT SHARE?" &#160;That sort of thing.I threw him a few tiny slivers of pork. &#160;Nothing too tasty. &#160;This is MY SANDWICH. &#160;Besides, onions are poisonous to dogs. &#160;You &#160;hear that, you little bastard?!I have a feeling he's going to dig in the trash as soon as my back is turned, anyway. oh. my god. there are no words to express the ecstasy. I have reviewed the paseo in fremont but I have to add to the one in shilshole. The food is just as great and it's a bonus for being right next to my house. Mainly I am writing because the cashier who rings me up every time is pretty funny. I cannot say enough about how great the food is and everyone else that I have made try it agrees. It is simply divine. Midnight Cuban Sandwich = Cheap. Messy. Yummy. Paseo is sandwich heaven and one of my favorite guilty pleasures in Seattle. &#160;I can't help but eat the entire thing they are that good!Once you get your food you forget how long it takes or that they only take cash! &#160;You can smell the onions half way down the street and I always find that I meet cool people in line.  I love the midnight cuban. &#160;The onions are caramelized to perfection and the pork has the best marinade and is so tender. I have heard that they can run out of stuff but that has never happened to me. &#160;If your worried call ahead 206-545-7440 Had the BEST Valentine's Day dinner with my dear Boo this evening. &#160;After being hit by the Cuban sandwich bug at 5:30ish, I called the Fremont location to suss out the bread situation: "Yeah, uh, we'll be running out of bread very, very soon," the nice honest man who answered the phone told me...so, Plan B:We decided to haul ourselves all the way over to the Ballard location (used to be a burger place, almost passed it but took a u turn and got there; look for the 'oops' paint bright tangerine building next to the flower market). &#160;There it was, with bread to spare. &#160;We stayed with the usual - my favorite chicken with onions, no jalepenos; Boo's favorite fish of the day (cod) light on the garlic aoli and no jalenpenos. &#160;Corn for both of us. &#160;One water, one ginger ale. &#160;It was kind of fun waiting in the cold with the other brave Seattlites, jumping up and down to stay warm while watching the guys cook up our meals.We packed it up and drove down to Golden Gardens, just in time to eat our messy Valentine's sammies in the car, watching the sunset and the bonfires on the beach. &#160;I didn't even mind when I dropped onions in my lap (it's hard to eat these sandwiches in the dark, let me tell you).Topped off the evening with a short wait in line at Molly Moon for some scout mint and strawberry. &#160;Happy Valentine's Day, indeed! This Paseo is like "original Paseo-lite" with less waiting and convenient parking. &#160;Their self-proclaimed "Most Popular" #2 Cuban Roast is a combination of soft pulled-pork, caramelized onions, and jalapenos, and aioli which make up a sloppy pile of greasy deliciousness inside a crusty, chewy baguette. &#160;Defiantly, the bread refuses to get soggy and compliments the filling to make this a near perfect creation. &#160;You know you are in for a treat when they give you about 30 napkins with a one-sandwich order.Prices are a little steep, whether you get roasted corn on the side seems to be hit or miss, seating is outdoors where it's windy and cold, and it's cash only. &#160;None of those things matter when the food is this good. Oh my gosh!!! This place is SO delicious!! I love that there are all Cuban people cooking the food! Since it was my first time, they told me to get the #2, the Cuban sandwich. &#160;It comes with corn as well that is also cooked to perfection.It's a very messy sandwich but totally worth it!!! The flavors marinated in with the pulled pork and the onions and their sauce is just to die for!!! You can really tell this is authentic food!! &#160;It's a perfect blend of spice and flavor, and I love that they scoop out the middle part of the bread and then toast it. &#160;It adds another level of texture.I definitely want to come back and try the Midnight Cuban Press because it looks like a work of art and I know the taste will be heavenly.It's a cash only place and at this location, they have no sign outside so just look for the line out the door and you'll find it!! I love this place!! &#160;Oh and order the beans and put them over your sandwich!! It's mui delicioso! !!!!!!!THIS PLACE IS THE SHIT.!!!!!!!!We had the humongous pork sandwich and some kind of tofu vegetarian plate entry. Both were huge. I was afraid the sandwich was going to cause the shortage of pork on the commodities market. On second thought, it probably did. The thing had so much pork that it was oinking all by itself. It was also filled with all sort of peppers and blah blah blah healthy stuff. But the pork people, the pork.All right, all right, calm down, Marko.The vegetarian plate was great. Tofu was cooked just right and the salsa that was poured over the whole thing was just zesty enough to be not too hot, but not too "white" either.What ever you do, make sure you get something with their grilled onions.WARNING-Be prepared to cream your pants the first time you bite into anything containing their onions!!! Read all the great reviews on here and just had to try it out. Like it so much, I went back the very next night! I got the chicken sandwich the first time. I'm not normally a fan of jalapenos, but everything about this was perfect. The flavors balanced out very well. The second time I went I got the West Caribbean Bowl. OMG, I told my BF like 8 time that I need to stop but I just couldn't! I pulled the chips to the side and pretty much mixed everything together. I'm SO glad I went to this place. I will be back very soon! The ONLY reason I'm giving this 4/5 stars is because of the guys who have taken my order. One was hanging with his GF and even went we went to the window to order, he continued to talk to her for 1-2 min before stopping and just looking at us. The second time the other guy had a friend hanging out as well who was LOUD. Both seemed more interested in there friends then there work. I understand there probably getting paid minimum wage, but common! Seared scallop sandwich, three stars, please, heavy on the cilantro.It's happy on a roll. Clones rarely match the original. Paseo has beaten the odds with this fantastic little shack, a place that once housed Gordo's and by extension some serious memories. Sometimes, though, much as Columbia Center slid us up a notch as a city, change brings good things. &#160;Gordo's was eh okay, just iconic. Paseo is damn good.The #2 is good. The Midnight Cuban is good. The corn on the cob is slathered in butter with garlic and cilantro, a holy union of three of my favorite things. Beware that sometimes they run out of bread, which will tell you how fresh it is. At long last, it is open when I am going by.I stop. Parking is crowded.I observe and read the menu..lots of good sounding items here. I could not remember which items people raved about &#160;on Yelp. I went for &#160;a simple chicken and &#160;beans and &#160;chips. The counter person was crisp, quick and in no mood to chat or discuss anything.The crowded table emptied. I was almost run over by someone driving in for his pickup order. I got my food rather quickly, all wrapped up for to go along with all I needed for my trip to the beach.I liked the chicken, a different taste &#160;than I had expected, but good nevertheless. I saved &#160;half my dinner for next day eating which was equally good.I shall come by another time. This is an excellent palce to pickup good food to take to &#160;the beach or up to a park.Thanks yelpers, I finally got to try it. Awesome find. Go work up a appetite at Golden Gardens then go to Paseo. The Heaviest sandwich with the tastiest grilled onions. Bring Cash It's almost too much ectasy to pull up to Paseo and see no line. &#160;I know that those happy days will be over once summer comes and have been going nearly once week, hoping to get my fix. &#160;Sadly, it seems the addiction only grows stronger. Not much to say that hasn't already been said about Paseo. &#160;Not fancy by anyone's measure, but the food is outstanding. &#160;Just make sure you get there before they sell out -- yes, they sell out of the most popular items on the menu some days. &#160;The sandwiches are great. &#160;The only problem is deciding which one to get. Just polished off The Press and it was real taste. &#160;Always satisfied after hitting Paseo!
You could do worse, but the food was nothing to write home about. However, it was in expensive, quick and the staff is very nice! If you are in Eastlake and need a quick meal, not a bad choice. AVOID this place!! And I say that even though I love Vietnamese food. I'm pretty sure my blood is at least half pho broth. So with that I would have loved to have a decent pho place near my place. I tried time and time again to get a decent meal from this place but it never came through. The pho tasted like old chicken stock with some faint spices mixed in and then topped with some very questionable meat. I ordered the teriyaki next time, took it home, and could only eat about 3 slices of meat. the chicken was dry, old, and I'm pretty confident that it was expired when it was cooked. And just to top it off, I've showed up on many different during "business hours" to find the doors locked and the lights off.  &#160; Again, just avoid this place and head in any direction. I'd suggest Louisa's down the street or you know what? Subway is next door and I hate to say it but it's a lot better than trying to eat expired meat and spiced water... Middle of the road in terms of taste. &#160;On the high side for price considering the quality and decor. &#160;Friendly service. &#160;Hope they stick around because the location is convenient.
I've been to quite a few Italian restaurants in Seattle and never been completely satisfied enough to become a regular customer, until now. "I was literally, blown away by my evening at Cascina Spinasse!". &#160; &#160;I felt like I walked into a quaint Italian bistro and fell in the arms of a warm embrace. &#160; The romantic atmosphere settles you into a calm knowing you've made a good choice. &#160;As you read the menu it's organized in typical Italian fashion; L'antipasto, Il primo, Il secondo, etc. that is both simple but elaborate. &#160;Or, should I just pick the choice to get a taste of everything? &#160; Hmm, what to choose as everything looks good? &#160;Our waiter greets us warmly and then lists out a couple additional specials that are off the menu; they sound great and you can't go wrong getting something made special for the evening. &#160;We start with a glass of sparkling wine and toast the evening, listening to chorus of other patrons in this intimate venue laughing and completely enjoying the evening. &#160; "I state, this is going to be really good!" &#160;Then, the waiter opens our bottle of wine letting it breath a bit; although tonight we brought &#160;a bottle from our collection; a Rubicon, the wine list is very inviting and you'd not be disappointed by choice from their wine list.Next, come's a small appetizer of a petit toast covered with butter and a thin slice of anchovy. &#160;Nice salty taste and completely unanticipated surprising treat. &#160; We then order skipping by the starters and go straight for the primo and secondo choices. &#160;After just the right amount of time to enjoy our wine and some conversation the primo comes. &#160;The primo is the pasta dish and let me say the flavor, texture of the homemade pasta was something I've never experienced; the pasta was complete bliss. &#160; I'm starting to lay back and realize that "Cascina Spinasse" is something special.The primo comes with some freshly baked Italian bread and it comes to good use for me as I soak up the last bit of sauce from my pasta and savor the complex flavors. &#160; I'm already completely satisfied and realize that we have the secondo and dolce to come. &#160;We share another glass of wine; our conversation dominated on how great the pasta tasted and the primo comes to the table. &#160; &#160;Another great dish and with the kitchen literally 10 feet away is the perfect temperature; just plated seconds before coming to our table. &#160;The presentation is delicate and I enjoyed every bite sharing a taste with my companion of the evening; and I had a taste of her entr&#233;e. &#160; A very intimate and romatic evening.Now, to clear out our palate I need to check out some of the desserts and have a coffee. &#160;Again, I hear about the special for the night and just get the special; some mixture of gelatos rolled into balls with a crumb coating. &#160;I don't exactly know what I'm eating; but it taste great! &#160; Then, an Italian press coffee comes that's almost like espresso; but isn't'. Our evening is wrapping up and almost 2 hours have gone by and notice other patrons that arrived before us are still enjoying their evening. &#160;It seems like only an hour had gone by and I have the feeling we should staying longer. &#160; Obviously, "Cascina Spinasse" has an inviting atmosphere.I've decided, I'll be coming back soon. Went here while in Seattle on business on the recommendation of a friend. Overall - outstanding and looking forward to going back. The service was attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting with a great semi-open kitchen giving you a nice voyeuristic view of the back of house. We started with an app of fresh shaved prosciutto di parma with in-season pickled ramps, then moved through a couple of "primi"; tagliatelle with butter, sage and parmesan (heady and sublime!) and the linguine with rabbit ragout. Both pastas were deliciously fresh and perfectly cooked. For mains - we had the pork shoulder and the chicken. Both were good dishes, but both could have benefitted from more sauce/acid components. On the chicken - more blood orange pieces and sauce, and more caramelized onions with the pork to provide some counterpoint to the richness of the meat. For dessert we had the semifreddo and the italian nougat gelato, both were delicious. Washed the meal down with a reasonably priced Barbera D'Asti. Overall - great experience and an awesome arrow in the quiver for a Seattle visit. I hate cabbage. I hate cabbage. I hate cabbage.I HATE CABBAGE!You hear me cabbage? I hate you. Wait? Are you telling me there is a cabbage dish that I might tolerate?YES! I finally found a cabbage dish that I not only can down without gagging, but actually LOVE!Dinner here is a truly memorable experience. The pasta dishes are prepared to absolute perfection. The pasta here is house made. I know this to be true because we actually saw them making it. Now back to the cabbage. I wish I had a chance to corner the Chef and interrogate him on just how in the holy Hell he was able to make the best cabbage dish on the face of the planet. My wife got it as a side to compliment her pork dish (which it did perfectly), but I did my best to bogart as many bites of it as I could. Cabbage goes with pasta right?Our server was amazing and one of the best we have had. She made sure to check in often and did an amazing job at describing each dish on the menu and was also as knowledgable on the wine list (100 percent Italian). My wife loved her so much that she hugged her on our way out.Now that I think about it, I wish I had hugged that cabbage dish.5 phenomenal stars! I loved Spinasse!My boyfriend and I came here on a visit from Portland. &#160;We did not have a reservation, and, miraculously, we got a table. &#160;No one even gave us the evil eye! &#160;It wasn't the awesomest table, but we were stoked. &#160;OK, so I don't know the names of any of the stuff I got, because I can't speak Italian, but let me tell you, it was all amazing! &#160;Really, everything I ate was delicious. &#160;My dessert was a favorite--a goat cheese mousse with candied blood orange. &#160;One of the best desserts I've ever had.The service at Spinasse was amazing. &#160;I was a little scared of the menu because it's really all in Italian, and I didn't want to ask what EVERYTHING was. &#160;But he made me feel totally at ease and not stupid and not rushed. &#160;He helped me pick an excellent wine, too. &#160;Also, the ambiance was great. &#160;Very comfortable, easy, and cute.I've recommended Spinasse to friends in Seattle and friends heading up there from Portland. &#160;Loves! Jason Stratton's Cascina Spinasse serves really rich and flavorful Italian food. I'm starting to think that the trick to being a James Beard nominated chef is to just make super rich food...it's good but that has to be mostly because it's covered in butter. Though Spinasse is a casual &amp; tiny neighborhood restaurant, it is more of a special occasion place because healthy people simply can't eat this kind of food everyday. We had:- Walnut Crespelle: This dish had a really unique flavor and was very enjoyed. The crepe wrap was nicely thin but rolled up enough times to make each bite satisfyingly thick &amp; chewy. The crepe was lined with a delicious creamy cheese, and the walnut sauce had a very Indian flavor.- Ricotta Carmelle: Cutest pasta dish I've ever seen. The Carmelle shape for pasta is basically a candy wrapper (adorable). The pasta stuffing was amazing - really fresh strong flavors of mint, parsley, and lemon, and the sauce was a simple generous coating of butter. I ordered the entree size, and could have eaten another entree sized portion that's how good it was. - Pork Shoulder: My boyfriend had this and said it was very tender &amp; very rich.The bar is pretty lacking if you are looking for a cocktail. They have a few hard liquors and a very limited number of mixers (tonic, soda, grapefruits, lemons...done). So the thing about surprises...is that you have no idea where you are going....but you should just trust in the surprise. &#160;Because how often do you actually get a break from things you already know about?! &#160; Entering into this place I was already anxious about the night. &#160;Could be a bad thing... slash could be a better perspective on things for the simple fact that the juice is worth the squeeze....?Started with the frio gras with a delicious intermingling of tripe (not just for pho!), and my palette was already pleased. &#160;But then again how many ways can you ruin delicious duck fat!? After came a rabbit with chickpeas dish, which was tasty, but not my favorite. &#160;But I might be biased &#160;with big meats as opposed to meats that flop around with carrots....? &#160;My favorite dish of the night was most definitely the pork shoulder dish. &#160;Savory and juicy, exactly what I wanted and needed for the end of a long day of surprise.The food was exceptional, and our server was just as ardent as could be. &#160;Spinasse is an amazing concept of great spice, exceptional service and distinguished flavors. &#160; I would definitely add it to my bookmarks if you haven't already.... &#160; &#160;;)And don't forget the wine...! I've been dying to eat at this restaurant for a long time and finally had the chance Friday. Wonderful overall experience, food was fabulous service was great. Reminded of my recent visit to Northern Italy- can't wait to go back! One of the best meals I've ever had, I have to admit all the hype I'd heard about this place is true!!! &#160;It's a small, comfy, little space on capitol hill with maybe a dozen or so tables. &#160;The space out the reservations so that people just trickle in and there's no big rush.... FYI you MUST have a reservation, this place gets packed.We ordered the antipasto platter - highly recommended! &#160;This will enable you to try a variety of apps. &#160;I particularly enjoyed the prosciutto and the roasted cauliflower. Do not skip the pasta course! &#160;Mitchell and I shared the rabbitt sausage dish which had been recommended by fellow yelpers and I was in heaven. &#160;The perfect amount of noodle and sausage with just a light sauce... really tasty!Entrees included the ribeye with fava beans for me (the fava beans were TO DIE for) and Mitchell had a dish whose name I can't remember, but it was basically shredded veal in sauce, cooked in cabbage and Mitchell had an almost transcendent experience with it. &#160;I personally thought it was too rich, I couldn't have eaten it all, MItchell claims he could have eaten another serving of it.The wine list is amazing. &#160;I was thrilled that our server did not give me the stink eye for ordering a glass of wine with my meal (I"m pregnant and I don't care if you don't agree with me), and both the wines Mitchell and I ordered by the glass were perfect. &#160;My Nebbiolo was smooth with dark fruit tones and the hubs had something else that was more european with hints of tobacco and dirt. &#160;YUM!!!Definitely one of the best meals I've ever had!! Ah, Spinasse! The pastas are delicious, light and delicate - the sauces not too heavy as to distract from the noodles themselves. The not so basic butter and sage pasta highlights each flavor individually. Simplicity and perfection at its finest. &#160;When I went I believe I had rabbit prepared three different ways. My type of place! You cannot go wrong with the food here. Everyone ordered something from each course, along with the antipasti sampler. Not one disappointing dish came out. The main courses tended to be on the rich side. The restaurant is small, romantic and intimate (aka get to know everything about the diners next to you). The decor is homey and woodsy. This is almost like comparing apples to oranges, but the food at Spinasse blows A16, La Ciccia, Flour + Water, etc... out of the water. Made reservations at Cascina Spinasse &#160;at the request of my out of town guest &#160;(who happens to be a food writer) for our whirlwind Seattle restaurant tour. &#160;I don't know if I could imagine a more delicious meal. &#160;We started with poached egg with fonduta and truffles. &#160; Our other appetizer was cauliflower flan with bagna cauda sauce. &#160;Both were remarkable. &#160;The presentation was beautiful and they were flawlessly executed. &#160;We followed with a pasta...very simple...but perfectly cooked. &#160;Main course was cabbage stuffed with veal and pork. &#160;I could go into incredible detail about how perfect everything was...because everything WAS perfect. &#160;The space is cozy and charming. &#160;The wait staff was appropriately attentive and we left &#160;feeling full of great food and good will. Spinasse has officially made it to my top favorite restaurants in Seattle.I love the dim and cozy atmosphere with a rustic vintage touch. &#160;Perfect location for date night.The egg noodle pasta is a must-have (it is handmade in house), along with their big green olives. &#160;Great selection of wine, although I'm not a connoiseur and would never pay the big bucks for your *insert fancy wine name here*.Good dough, when you're in the mood for spending the dough. "Easily one of the best handmade pastas I've had."Appetizer: Cauliflower flan with bagna cauda sauce. Entrees: Hand cut egg pasta with butter and sage and the tagliatelle with lamb ragu.Dessert: Gelato and fried gnocchi covered in dark chocolate with a side of chocolate mousseContext: 1.5yr dating anniversaryI came here with my girlfriend and had an amazing time. The atmosphere and ambience was wonderful, and the decor was quaint. The lighting inside was also really perfect for a romantic, italian dinner for two. Make no mistake, this would be an ideal spot if you were thinking of a romantic setting.Now, the food was fantastic. I haven't had a delectable start to finish meal like that in a while, and I really loved how simple yet full of flavor the dishes were. My personal favorite was the hand cut egg pasta with butter &amp; sage and stress that it is a MUST if you are visiting from out of town. Do yourself a favor, and get it. Dessert was also memorable, however I liked the Gelato far more than the fried gnocchi. Service was great, and the hostess was attentive to our needs. The price is a little high for the amount of food that you get, but otherwise, this is definitely a little italian gem that is perfect for either a special occasion with a certain someone or a lovely meal with the family. Don't know where to begin. Will be smiling about this meal for days. I have been bending my fiance's ear about this place since October. &#160;Finally got here tonight and it exceeded expectations. It's a Sunday and we got an 8:30 reservation- make sure to call ahead or use Open Table! Our waiter (Luis) was attentive and knowledgeable without being pretentious. He recommended a perfect wine to get us started. The anchovy topped buttered crostini set the tone- simple and spectacular! The little corner table by the window was so romantic. We started with a chickpea insalata with marinated rabbit and homemade mayo- amazing. It went perfectly with the wonderful bread. Next we had the famous butter and sage pasta and a new rabbit sausage pasta primi. For secondi we both had the pork shoulder- braised and slow cooked with anchovy and lemon- good God! There just aren't words. &#160;Our server got the rabbit sausage recipe from the chef for us (fianc&#233; makes wild game sausage) and brought me an excellent grappa to finish things out. I could die happy!!! Will be back again and again- next time plan to try the extravagant tasting menu. Believe the hype- this place earns it's five stars in every way. Authentic and delicious meal where you can feel the care and preparation placed into each dish. &#160;The wait staff is extremely knowledgeable and spot on with the recommendations. &#160;Love the rotating menu of fresh pastas. &#160;DO make reservations if you plan on going on the weekend. &#160; It is an amazing experience to taste a superior pasta. Made the mistake of coming here just before going on a 2 month drive across Europe and Central Asia. Dreamt of that goddamned tajarin while eating potato chips and juice for days. Ate pasta in every city we went to, thought about it when eating dehydrated lasagna. Went here the first week we got back. Go here, have tajarin. You'll be so happy you won't even notice the buttcrack on the barstool in front of you. Since I moved to Seattle from NJ, I've been dying to find...1.) A good Italian restaurant2.) A restaurant where patrons have enough class to take off their baseball caps.I'm happy to say that Spinasse was both. My date and I had the tasting menu with wine pairings, and it was a HUGE amount of food (sinfully delicious too). Service was quick and excellent, but leave yourself plenty of time if you want to do the tasting menu as well. Our reservation was for 5:30 and it was past 7:30 by the time we left. And trust me... you WANT the tasting menu.Also, during the meal I asked our server to write down the name of a wine we had. He was obviously quite busy and we both forgot about it. A few hours later on my way our of the symphony I turned my phone on to find a voicemail from him. He actually went into my online reservation, got my cell number, and called to tell me (and spell out) the name of the wine, the region it's from, the vineyard, etc. You just don't get service like this anymore. Not anywhere.Easily the most complete all-around dining experience I've had on this coast. Good staff, great pasta- we tried most of the menu between the three of us and everything was good. eat pasta here!! My fiance and I were given a gift card for Spinasse and have been excited to try it out. Our experience was outstanding and I can't wait until we can go here again. We didn't make a reservation but they were able to seat us at the bar - and I don't think we would want to sit anywhere else. The kitchen is completely open and we got to watch everything that was going on - it was fascinating to see the pasta being transformed from a ball of dough to a thin sheet 20 feet long. Our waiter was great - he explained/recommended dishes and was very attentive throughout our whole meal.We started with the trout and asparagus antipasti, which was delicious - we both did a half order of primo dishes - my fiance got the ragu egg pasta, and I opted for the goat stuffed pasta. I wasn't too excited about the ragu pasta until I tasted it - and then I wanted to eat his whole plate! He opted for the veal/pork meat course, and I chose the rabbit...it was very tender and fell off the bone, and the sauce was incredible. &#160;Overall, we felt very comfortable and it definitely felt like a "community" restaurant. We will be back! Yes. A warm welcome into a cute, rustic Capitol Hill spot gave me a "this is going to be good" vibe, and for once, the voices in my head did not lie. YUM to everything- cauliflower, sformato, two unreal pastas (Eddie only made noises, non disparaging!) and a to. die. rib eye with bread salad. &#160;Sincere, lovely service, interesting wines, and hilARIOUS ladies as neighbors ("Don't mind her, she has a migraine"). A high point of our Seattle takeover. Dining at Cascina Spinasse feels like you are on a vacation away... not sure exactly why.. but &#160;to me Cascina Spinasse has the hum and vibe of a SF restaurant. No disrespect Seattle!Perhaps it's the great use of the small space, the extensive wine list, the basic but awesome menu, the knowledgeable servers whom are very professional in the service they provide or could it be the artistic presentation and small gourmet servings?! I don't know. All I know is I love it!I had not a chance to read the reviews before arriving with my husband and a friend visiting in town. Once arriving with a reservation I was not worried about the seating, it is close but nothing you have to worry about if deciding on dining here- other than the fact that they run out of tables and then you may not get in until late if dining prime time. Make reservations.Our server was like our food guide to the evening she was knowledgeable and gave great recommendations. This was like theater to me. I loved the open kitchen and cozy atmosphere. It is hard not to notice all the fine touches from the table to the kitchen itself. I would love to come back and dine for the "chef's counter meal" that is if my pocketbook allowed it! &#160;We started off with an olive bowl and a prosciutto plate as appetizers, both were excellent. Then we all shared the chicken, ravioli and the fabulous homemade thin hand cut egg pasta with sage and butter. Taste like heaven.. All were melt in your mouth fantastic! It is a lil pricey and servings are small so you have room for the proper 4 courses. I will be back once a special occasion permits. Arrivederci food friends! WOW. &#160;Had one of the most amazing dinners here. &#160;Actually the first time I ate here I got really drunk and could not remember a single thing I ate. &#160;Yeah it was bad and embarrassing. &#160;Only had one glass of wine this time. &#160;Started out with the BEST thing ever - poached egg with fonduta and truffle. &#160;Holy crackilicious. &#160;After the first bite I had to stop and say WTF. &#160;Is this for real? &#160;I talked about it for three days. Sunchokes were next. &#160;A perfect combination of cripy cold and salty. &#160;Beef cheeks were the entree. &#160;Pot roast italian style. &#160;Amazing and so flavorful you could taste the love. &#160;Date cake was the perfect ending. I've heard so much about Spinasse and finally had a chance to stop by for dinner recently after a drink next door at Artusi. We sat at the bar and shared the tagliatelle with mushrooms - my absolute favorite. We also ordered the rabbit and venison but the pasta was the standout dish of the night. Looking forward to more dinners here! Simply the best pasta in Seattle. &#160;Great service, consistently great food, in a tiny space that feels very European. &#160;Highly recommend. Yes!!!! &#160;Everything was perfect. &#160;Great great food, wine, service, setting, we loved it. Best pasta ever. Love, love, love this place. Everything we tasted was absolutely delicious, the service was impeccable and the atmosphere is amazing. Can't wait to go back!
The problem with the Pike Place Market is that you never really &#160;know where anything is - Market Grill is about 30 paces North from Rachel the Brass Pig on the Eastern wall. It's nothing fancy, just a grill with a counter and a few permanent bar stools around it. The coleslaw that they serve looks like something from a tub (although I'm sure it's not) but the salmon sandwich...OMG...the salmon sandwich is amazing. The bread is perfectly toasted and the salmon is grilled right in front of you. My only complaint - You could give me a bit more salmon when I'm spending $9+ on a sandwich. Regardless of the price I would go back. The sandwich is just that good. When I compile my list of Places I love / Places that make me happy, Market Grill will definitely be on the list.First of all, it's smack dab in the middle of the market so do not go in tourist season nor should you go at peak lunch time. &#160;There are about six seats at the counter and room to stand around for about five more. &#160;The menu is salmon or halibut sandwiches and clam chowder. &#160;And soda. &#160;Market Grill actually gets a point knocked off for the Seattle-style of serving sandwiches on those mouth-wrenching hard baguettes. &#160;You know, your mouth gets all torn up inside from eating the grilled bread. &#160;But the place gets the point back for offering a choice of having your fish on salad greens or rice, so take your choice.The fish is consistently perfectly cooked. &#160;When was the last time a restaurant, any restaurant, consistently cooked its fish perfectly? &#160;And the staff is so patient... they must explain a hundred times a day the choices. &#160;It's a bit confusing... you can have your fish on bread, salad or rice. &#160;The salad and rice are not sides to the sandwich as you might think a "platter" suggests. &#160;A platter is a sandwich with a side of slaw. &#160;You cannot order just a sandwich. &#160;You can modify your platter order by subbing in salad or rice for the fish on bread. &#160;If you order the platter with the fish on salad it comes with toasted bread. &#160;Got it?Free refills on from the soda fountain. &#160;Two full-sized napkins. &#160;Great servers. &#160;All around great place. A great bowl of chowder, and amazing salmon sandwiches (although I do mine as the salad version). &#160;Now if only i could get a Sierra Nevada to go with that . . . . (sometimes I brown bag a little vino from the Tasting Room) (and then it's perfect) Thinking that everything here was going to be a tourist trap - dried out fish, miniscule portions, I was ill-prepared for the utter enjoyment of plowing through a "halibut platter" at Market Grill. &#160;Paper cartons, tons of rice and grilled onions, "blackened" piece of decent sized fish, and some tomatoes, plus some great cole slaw and garlic bread make this a perfect stop for lunch while you're mingling with the crowds at the Market. &#160;Be warned, this is not dining; just 8 bar stools on either side of the grill, but if you can get a seat sit down and enjoy this place. Fantastic. Great fresh grilled seafood here. Nothing fried. All nicely prepared sandwiches, or platters for that experience of Seattle. Try the grilled salmon and the clam chowder. The salmon was nice and flaky with that beautiful grilled flavor in the background and the chowder was light and not too salty. Compared to most chowders it was a nice and flavorful taste without being overpowering with cream or seasoning. If you are a tourist, come here and grab something on the go as you stroll through the markets many wonderful shops.Good For: counter lunch, Pike Place experience
I've been twice in two weeks, but I have an excuse in the form of a 22-weeks-developing fetus who only wants me to eat salty potatoes and drink chocolate milk.The salty potatoes from my first visit were hand cut waffle fries, straight out of the fryer and doused in seasoned salt. &#160;I drowned them in malt vinegar and ate them with ketchup and ranch. &#160;Last night, the fries were hand cut regular french fries but equally delicious...and I looooove that there's malt vinegar just hanging around for general consumption.I don't actually eat red meat, so I'm thankful for the veggie/chicken options on the menu but that's pretty much required in Seattle, huh? &#160;I've had the buffalo chicken burger both times, which is impressive mostly because it's a fresh chicken breast, hand dredged and topped with buffalo sauce, grilled onions, tomato, and ranch. &#160;I'm looking forward to trying more stuff on the menu, though. &#160;My friend who eats no meat ordered the portobella mushroom burger, which she thought would be a portobella mushroom and no burger but uh oh, there was red meat present. &#160;She brought it up to the front, explained her mistake, and they had a brand new burger sans meat out to her in a few minutes. &#160;The guys who work there are super friendly, and one of them even asked if we wanted take some leftover food to give to homeless people on our walk. &#160;I will eat here again, and probably on a Wednesday when burgers are half off after 3pm. mmmm deliciously messy burger. The other day there were so many commercials on for fast food burgers, that I told my husband how we needed to go to Blue Moon that night. Conveniently enough, it was Wednesday so there was half off burgers!We have been here a few times now. I am a big fan of the Southwestern Burger. Pepper Jack Cheese, Buffalo sauce, with Jalapeno Bottle Caps is a great combo for a lover of spice. The dripping Buffalo sauce is so glorious, I want to lick my fingers clean. My mouth waters just thinking of it. The fries and the jalapeno bottle caps are good when dipped in the hot sauce, but nothing I would go there specifically for. They lost a star because they got more expensive. Still fantastic burgers.Weds 3p - close is 1/2 price. I'm headed over now. Walking in I noticed a "strange" odor. Unpleasant. But I was starving so I stayed. Ordered a Blueshroom Burger ( no fries ). Burger was very tasty. I'd go back. A solid 3 star burger joint, not spectacular but decent. &#160;Go for wednesday happy hour (half price burger after 3pm) for the best deal.I've had a Beef Blue Hawaiian Burger and Veggie Southwest Burger there. &#160;Quality of both burgers were average, though I question their inclusion of pickles on the hawaiian burger. &#160;The southwest burger has a pleasant amount of heat, not too hot, but enough to feel it. &#160;Their fries were mediocre both times, they seemed stale and over cooked. &#160;The order of regular fries was better than the waffles fries. &#160;There was barely any bite left to the waffle fries they were so over done. &#160;Since both burgers were purchased during a wednesday happy hour I can't be too bitter. &#160;I'll be back for another Wednesday happy hour, but likely won't frequent the regular price menu often. Been craving a burger for about a week now, so maybe going in, expectations were just a smidge too high.Aside from the cook and the guy at the counter taking orders, I was the only person in the joint. &#160;Well, the janitor did pop in to clean the bathrooms during the fifteen minutes I was waiting. &#160;But that was it, just me and the staff, so the wait seemed a little hefty. &#160;At least they had some good tunes playing; I was told it was a Pandora station based on Lou Reed. &#160;The 3 or 4 songs I heard while there were a nice change from standard classic rock and/or contemporary/easy listening most places seem to play. &#160;Points for that!I ordered the barbeque burger, going against my better judgement which would've been the black and blue burger. &#160;It's hard to trust others with blue cheese, ya know? &#160;Should've sucked it up. &#160;But what can I say about what I did order? &#160;The burger had a nice smoky flavor to it, as it should considering that my sweater also has a nice smoky - well, smell, at least. The barbeque sauce was so thick it was practically a gel, but they gave an appropriate amount and the toppings were definitely super fresh. &#160;The waffle cut fries were a bitter disappointment. &#160;Sniff. &#160;I was really looking forward to the fries, but they were soooo crispy that they killed my post-wisdom teeth mouth. &#160;And yeah, the wisdom teeth came out damn near a month ago - fries should not make it hurt!Anyway, it was definitely a disappointment, but not necessarily a place I'd avoid in the future. &#160;Even though I waited for so long, the guy at the counter was appropriately fun to flirt and talk with, and I think I'd like other of their burger offerings better. &#160;I would, however, attempt the onion rings next time. I have an affinity for their burgers. I think they compare very well against Red Mill which are also in the same price range. They have a coupon in the Chinook book if you have one of those. Mentions they use only Painted Hills all natural beef in their burgers.Burgers are definitely a handful and every time I have gone, the burgers and sides were all cooked to order by a very friendly staff. At the next price level, I would highly recommend Sport across Seattle Center for the Kobe burger with Tillamook cheese... Sometimes you want something between a McDonalds and Sport, Blue Moon perfectly fits that bill, especially if you are in the area. I had one of the tastiest burgers I've had the pleasure of putting in my mouth. The flavor might have been enhanced by the fact that I came here right after hitting cupcake camp and therefore was on a sugar-high and needed salt STAT. I ordered the black and blue burger and my mom ordered their April special which was a lamb burger. My black and blue was perfectly cooked and had the perfect amount of blue cheese on it. My mom's lamb burger was good but I liked mine better. I thought the prices were a bit high especially my mom's since it was almost $9 for the burger alone! The hand cut fries were okay...nothing to write home about. Stick to the burgers and you won't be disappointed. A-OK pretty much describes it. &#160;The waffle fries were decent (but still nowhere near Chickfila waffle fries). &#160;Burger was fine but extra charred on the bottom. &#160;Chicken wings were pretty good. &#160;Worth it on 1/2 price Wednesdays, but probably not otherwise.Side note: Staff was nice, but noticed all kitchen staff had long hair that wasn't restrained at all... This place has pretty good food, but it tends to be on the expensive side. So be sure to go on wednesday when they have a 50% off special (which I believe is only good after 5pm).I usually get the hawaiian burger, which is good for about 2/3 and then everything is just completely soggy. Not sure what they could do about that except wrap the pineapple in lettuce or something.Location is next to nothing really. The closest thing seems to be firestone tires and parking is pretty sparse, b/c it is all street parking.All and all, I probably go to this place once every few months. It is OK, but not amazing.
Wow. I just got treated so freaking well at Grand Central, I couldn't believe it!I ordered a small cappuccino and eggs and toast to go and I was standing near the counter waiting for my food to get cooked. When I went to take the second sip off of my cappuccino the lid popped off the cup on the way to my mouth and most of the drink poured down my front and on to the floor. What a dumbass, right? Luckily, I was wearing a raincoat today so I escaped with only mild embarrassment and looking slightly like I had peed myself instead of third degree burns. But hey, as I said it is raining today and besides, looking like you've peed yourself isn't that out of place for that section of Pioneer Square. Well, anyways, instead of laughing at me and telling me that I should have brought in my tippee cup because I obviously am not ready for big people cups as I would have done had our positions been reversed, they handed me a towel, replaced my drink, AND GAVE ME A FREE BLUEBERRY MUFFIN! The mind boggles at such sheer niceness so early in the morning. The Moral: Spill things on yourself at Grand Central and you get a muffin. Good food, nice people. Too slow for lunch if you don't have some time. Bit pricey but your paying for something a little better than the rest so its worth it. Good spot for coffee in the morning also. It's unfortunate that my first post must be one of utter disappointment, but I was flabbergasted at my experience here. &#160;I've been here a couple of times prior to this experience, both during lunch rush. &#160;So I was okay with the long line, and decent food. &#160;I thought the sandwiches, salads, and soups were a bit overpriced, but I brushed it off since this place is mere footsteps to my office. &#160;Anyway, I went in today, well after lunch rush mind you (around 2:30pm), to get an egg salad sandwich. &#160;I ask "can you add ham to the egg salad sandwich?" &#160;Cashier responds "Yeah, we can do that." &#160;Assuming it would be an extra dollar or two max, I say "Sweet, make it to go please." &#160;He rings me up and takes my card and the total is $11.77. &#160;My jaw drops. &#160;$4 extra for ham! &#160;And the whole earth stops rotating. &#160;I'm giving it an extra star to make it a paltry 2 because it's partially my fault for not asking how much the price is, but charging that much money for an egg salad sandwich with ham is quite immoral in my book. &#160;In addition to this, I wait, at minimum 10-15 minutes for this sandwich to be made with maybe, just maybe, 2-3 people in front of me. &#160;Homedude making the sandwiches was talking about iPods, taking his sweet ol' time. &#160;That, my friends, is NOT how you run a business. &#160;I shall never return to this place again.
The lady behind the counter seemed annoyed that we were making her get up to take our order. Dr. Phil was playing on the flat screen, and the environment is just really drab, and besides all of that, the food was just okay.It's not bad, it's just not good either, and it was ready roughly 4 seconds after i ordered. &#160;That concerns me. &#160;I like fast service but if it's ready that fast and there is no one else in the place, how long has that cooked chicken been sitting around waiting for me to walk in and eat it? Oh, yeah, no cards. &#160;Meh whatever. Average Average Average. Actually, maybe a little bit below average. Unfortunately, due to its convenient location across the street from Seattle University, they get tons of business. Teriyaki sauce is too watered down too.
I had my working lunch here today. It was my second time (my first being a year ago). &#160;I feel like by the pound places can get pricey fast so I was careful not to get too greedy. They have a variety here: salad, prepared salads, sushi, rice, chow mein, spring rolls, tempura, katsu etc. I had some tuna salad, a noodle salad, a cold stir fry of mushrooms and zucchini, sushi and a piece of shrimp katsu. &#160;It actually ended up being just undr 1 lb so my lunch came to just over $6 with tax. &#160;Not bad and how much you spend is controllable (since I figured out I can control it) which is nice. The staff was very nice and offered a rubber band since I was carrying things for work too. The food was ...ok. &#160;I mean, I didn't expect luxury. &#160;The warm foods would have probably been better than the salads and sushi because the shrimp katsu was good. The salads were ok but it was the sushi I had a problem with-The rice seemed weird and the seafood was weird. &#160;The tuna had a strange texture and none of it really seemed like sushi. &#160;It wasn't even supermarket sushi quality so I probably will skip that and get some fried rice or something instead next time.I appreciated the variety and option of faux-Asian food in the building. The meat and noodle dishes are slightly above average but the great salads and fresh fruit makes this place special. &#160;Good value too if you avoid the starches.
This has to be the worst Indian food I have ever eaten. &#160;In fact I can't eat it. &#160;I will never order from this restaurant again!
Sunrice is the best food in Laurelhurst. &#160;I know, you might say that Laurelhurst doesn't have good food (think Marlai Thai, Jak's, Varlamos) so that isn't a great compliment, but I still had to say it. &#160;I would say even better than the little French bistro Chloe since you can actually get something with real flavor without butter as the main component. and taste bud numbing agent. &#160;But back to Sunrice. &#160;Sunrice is good food, period. &#160;Probably their best and economical dish (for a mere 7 bucks) is the daily special which includes tofu (or meat if you swing that way), rice, sweet potato noodles, and a salad. &#160;Kim, the owner, actually gives you enough to save for your next meal be it lunch or dinner or to share with someone. &#160;She also has a number of other dishes like curry, sushi like rolls, and soups. &#160;It'll fill you up and wanting to go back for dinner. &#160;But there lies the only disappointment. &#160;Sunrice is only open Mon-Thu 12-2pm. &#160;Really, too short of a time span for such a place to be open. &#160;But I understand, running a restaurant is stressful and demanding so limiting hours for walk-in customers and making most of your business wholesale makes a lot of sense. &#160;Now back to thinking about when I can go visit Sunrice next. Lunch special is delicious! &#160;The not-spicy version still has lots of flavor, the meat is tender, and the salad better than average Teriyaki restaurant salads. &#160;Also, the owner is super friendly.
My first Indian food experience (I know, sad existence before, bite me).Read other reviews for details- you have 37 to choose from- but in short: - Beautiful restaurant- Charming, attentive service- Scrumptious, sharable plates- Very affordable dinner (table mate mentioned the lunch buffet is also to die for as you can sample multiple dishes at one sitting)- Left overs nearly as good as they were when fresh.Numma-numma in my tumma. We showed up at 2pm and were told to come in, but that the lunch buffet closed at 2:30. We figured that was enough time, so we grabbed our plates, chose from the (relatively extensive) buffet, sat down and started to eat. Before we had finished 10 bites, we were informed that they were closing the buffet in 10 minutes, so to go get more food (1). Two minutes later, someone else came over and told us the same thing (2). We smiled, said "thank you", and continued to eat. Five minutes later, they asked if we were done (3). We weren't. Five minutes after THAT, we got another "buffet is closing" notice (4). I have never felt so hustled to eat in my life- which is really unfortunate when you are eating Indian food. Scarfing that down can be a huge mistake. I'm willing to chalk this less-than-mellow meal down to our timing. Arriving at the tail end of a buffet when a restaurant is trying to close was really annoying of us. I get that. But it's also really annoying when they so obviously want you to leave that they prevent you from enjoying the meal and make you never want to come back. Furthermore, the food wasn't even that good. The naan was thin, too crispy, and burnt. The chicken masala was flavorless. The rice was overcooked. The ground chicken dish was inedible. That green sauce that I love so much was disgusting. Although the element of timing soured the experience, it is highly unlikely that I will come back. Better food can definitely be found elsewhere. Roti has the BEST Indian food in Seattle. The menu is perfect, each dish is a masterpiece. My favorite things to order are the eggplant bharta and the aloo saag. I am a huge fan of spicy food, and let me say, when you ask for it.. you are well taken care of. The mango chutney, garlic naan, and raita are must haves when you order any dish. The staff/owners are a big part of why this place is so great.. always great service. For the full experience, I recommend you dine in and stay awhile. Appreciate the meticulous wonderful decor and enjoy one of their large kingfishers. I love this place.Admittedly, the first time I went, I was a little nonplussed. We had a shaky relationship with our waiter, but I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that he was new at the time.However, each subsequent time, the service has been awesome. The food is, of course, great, and makes your taste buds dance happily as they clamor for more.I am a huge fan of the Bindi Masala (I love okra something fierce) and the vegetable Pakora. I usually go with a friend and we share one order of each, and leave completely stuffed. I certainly couldn't finish an entree by myself. They have a few decent wines on their menu, and I have yet to try any dessert there but would like to, because I bet they'd be awesome too. Every time I go there, there are other patrons enjoying their dinner quite vocally, and I always hear "oh! you have to try this! it's so GOOD!" across the restaurant, which is always a good sign.In a word.... yum. Solid, traditional Indian food. And I'm especially picky about Indian after visiting New Delhi and spending several years enjoying Chicago's awesome Indian district. I went to Roti with a group of four shortly after the place opened for dinner and tried the eggplant bharta, saag paneer, mint kebab, pomegranate chicken, shammi kebab and vegetable pakoras. I'd recommend all of them. Just be sure that you be honest when the waiter or waitress asks if you want the food spicy. We ordered ours medium and it definitely had a kick -- in a good way.
Best sushi bar in Seattle.Catch Shiro (the main sushi chef) on a not so busy day. And don't bother sitting at a table because the sushi bar is where you really want to be. And to get a spot at the bar, be there at opening time or plan to wait in line for upto or over an hour. Because they don't take reservation for the seats at the sushi bar. Best way to go is to just tell themto decide what to serve you. Ask about what's cooking in the kitchen. You'll be pleasently surprised. Often hailed as the best sushi in Seattle, Shiro's is far more than "just another place for sushi in Seattle". As one would expect from any genuine sushi establishment, its d&#233;cor is modest, its size conservative, and its staff is on pins to please. The g/f and I joined another couple for our evening feast. The gentleman of the couple is a practicing sushi chef himself and said a former co-worker of his was now apart of the famed Shio's sushi crew. So it was with this guiding hand of expertise and inside information that we ordered a bevy of seafood wonders. The line up stars were the Geoduck, sea urchins, black cod, and of course the Chef's (Shiro himself) choice of the finest and fresh sashimi of the day. It was on this evening that I discovered that even a relative sashimi novice (me) was able to tell the difference between average quality and way-better-than-average quality. I'm afraid to say it was the best quality because I feel that just opens up a huge debate about who serves the real "best" and that's just an argument I'm not in the mood for right now. For me, and just me, this stands as the finest sushi I've had in Seattle. No I didn't see Ichiro (on multiple occasions I was asked this when I said I visited Shiro's). Holy expensive sushi Batman!I am a fan. My mother learned to eat sushi from Shiro about 30 years ago, and so he always has a place in my heart. But it IS expensive for what it is. I went here on a date the other night, and our service was amazing. Alan (I believe) was possibly the best waiter I have had in this city, incredibly attentive and really made the evening. His recommendations were superb as well. The sushi was quite good, though in all honesty I have had the same quality at Musashi's for easily 1/4 of the price. The geoduck, while good, was not as fresh as I had it at kisaku. It was slightly fishy tasting here, and at kisaku it has no fishy flavor. The Tuna poke was incredible, our sake amazing (though incredibly expensive). While I do think the sushi here is great, I still think i will not be coming back because it is just too expensive for me. I would rather enjoy myself and get full at Musashi's than stress about the check at Shiro's. &#160;However, if service is what you are after, and you have money to spend...Shiro's is your place. A Japanese co-worker (Jem, you should have known better) recommended this place and I was not impressed at all. &#160;Their food was so plain and service was so slow. &#160;I was hoping to see some wild shit, I meant kick ass rolls or some special sushi I have never seen before but it was too catered for Americans. &#160;Maybe I should have tried something else. We had a really good dinner here. The place is very small- call ahead for reservations or avoid peak dinner hours. The sushi menu was tough to navigate- they have a lot of rolls with ambiguous names with no descriptions (Shiro's Roll, Salmon Special, etc) and the only way to know what they are is to sit there and ask the server what each one is. This place is def not built for kids, although they were very friendly to our 2 y.o. and there were other kids in there. The sushi was really amazing- possibly the best sushi I've ever had. It was very tasty and very fresh, and very nicely presented. They mix the drinks pretty weak but gave me a really nice drink when I ordered a double for the 2nd drink (the server pointed out that she charged me for a single only which I thought was cool). The green tea they served us at the end of the meal was awesome, too. If we lived in Seattle we would go again. I came here last year on a first date, a very good first date. We were seated at the bar and Shiro himself was working the bar. He was very friendly and helpful and sent stuff my way I would normally never try myself. I loved it! We just had him send us whatever he thought was the best and the only misstep was geoduck, which I now know I'm not a fan of at all.It been too long since my visit to recall what we ate with clarity, &#160;but I remember leaving absolutely stuffed and happy.Very good first date. Thankfully I didn't have to pay this one. Its spendy here oh lord.I would say this isn't the best place for groups of more than 3 as inside can get really crowded. Call ahead and see what day Shiro himself will be working. Hes a treat My number one reason for moving to Seattle: BOMB-A$$ Sashimi/Sushi! Okay, so I knew about this place b/c it is advertised in Seattle guide books as the place Ichiro frequents (apparently every month according to the waiter we had today). When I was a visitor of Seattle 2 years ago, my friend and I fell in love... her moreso than me. She won't eat Toro anymore in San Francisco for fear of dissatisfaction. Yes, it is pricey; but it is well worth the quality of fish AND service. Naturally, I brought Ed T. here for some authentic Japanese freshness. I made reservations for 2 @ 7:30 and when we walked into this small restaurant we were promptly offered a choice of sushi bar or table. My cousin opts for the table and we are instantly seated. I excuse myself to the bathroom which can be reached in a maze-like fashion. It has a security code for access. The bathroom is fairly clean with 2 stalls, but there are no toilet seat covers. When I return to the table, a basket with 2 white, warm, and damp towels is waiting. The waiter asks me if I want tea with his Japanese accent (I LOVE that the workers here are native Japanese). I politely reply a yes. He returns with my tea and he spits out the specials of a cooked Geoduck appetizer, fresh live sea urchin, and fresh albacore tuna. We say thank you and so we look over the menu. Since Ed T. usually sticks to the basic sashimi offerings, I convince him to try the fresh sea urchin, surf clam, toro, and albacore nigiri, and the geoduck appetizer. He also orders the Black Cod dinner and I order the Chicken Kara-Age and the Poke Belltown. We receive our waters and Ed T. is served with a salad (cucumbers, shrimp, and lemon wedges) in an octagonal bowl and miso soup in a cup with a lid. This comes when you order a dinner. The Poke Belltown arrives and it is presented artistically with a bush of daikon radish and a cucumber cut like a fan leaned against the radish. Adjacent is a heaping scoop of poke dressed in a creamy Japanese vinagrette, scallions, and orange tobiko. It is very fresh and tasty. Next is the geoduck appetizer (Giant cooked clam appetizer). Huge pieces of grilled clam served with grilled shitake? mushrooms and onions on a bed of cabbage and garnished with 3 slices of tomatoes standing up. It was delicious and not too chewy. It was soft and tender. After that the fresh sea urchin arrives and boy were we surprised. It is presented in the spiny sea urchin shell on a bed of lettuce with daikon and a lemon wedge fan. The fresh sea urchin is absolutely heavenly and the texture is like butter. It melts in your mouth like ice in hot water. WOW!! Now I don't know if I could ever sea urchin in any other place for fear of dissatisfaction. And you get a lot of it. Lastly, we receive the nigiri, kara-age, and black cod. The nigiri is very fresh and of course does not smell fishy. The chicken kara-age is presented as 8 little breaded drummettes standing on the head with the bone end forming a tip. It almost looks like a perfectly formed X-mas tree. It is perfectly deep-fried so it isn't oily, well-seasoned that it isn't salty and it doesn't need any sauce/broth (other places have served it as cubes of deep-fried chicken with a sauce/broth), and succulent. The Black Cod dinner is presented as 2 halves of a large, plump cod grilled to perfection with teriyaki-sauteed green beans and carrots, 2 halves of a gigantic grilled red potatoe on a skewer, and a side of a bowl of rice. The black cod is equally sweet and salty and just melts in your mouth. It is so soft and juicy. Each sliver of fish just falls at each picking. MMM!!The service here is impeccable. The tea was usually always filled and they would ask how we are doing. The wait staff is all dressed in black and white. After they have cleared our table, they bring us a fresh new cup of tea, toothpicks in a mini-saucer, and a basket of warm, damp, white towels for cleaning our hands. I LOVE it. And what I love even more is that a majority of the patrons are Japanese themselves. You know that it has to be that good. The next time that I return here, I think that I am gonna go Omakase-style (they offer this on the menu). Fresh live sea urchin can never be as good as this place. Came here after an Happy Hour so a bit buzz, not a good way to spent 120 bucksService = Lady was overly friendly, and sometimes could be a bad thing but work out wellAmbiance = I'll take a bit more decor and style, but hopefully sushi will make up!Food = Great! but not awesomePrice = $$$Favorite = Food was great!, wish I could elaborate a bit more but after a few sake things goes blurWorst = date spill my sake =(Final Say = Experience as a whole was great! &#160;will be back to redetermine whether I jip them of their 5 star I'm no sushi expert, but I ordered a salmon and geoduck nigiri. &#160;Both were good, although not cheap. &#160;$2.50-$3 a piece. &#160;If you go, you MUST get the black cod. &#160;I think it was $10...maybe $12. &#160;I've never had that fish before, but OMG it was so flavorful and velvety. &#160;I couldn't stop thinking about it for hours after we left. &#160;The soft shell crab was nice too.The restaurant isn't very big, so I'd recommend calling in to avoid a wait. This place was amazing! &#160;I don't usually eat raw sushi due to not trusting the freshness of the fish, but Shiro's fish was extremely fresh. Definitely sit at the bar and let the chef select pieces for you. I have a shellfish allergy (no crab, lobster, octopus, or shrimp) but that wasn't an issue at all. The tuna poke was my favorite. We also ordered seaweed salad and the blackcod, which was really tasty.The part that I really liked was when the sushi chef would instruct us on how to eat the different pieces. Most of them, we weren't supposed to use soy sauce because we were told it wasn't needed and would ruin the flavor. A few &#160;pieces we were told we should dip with a bit of soy sauce and wasabi. &#160;I did ask for a dragon roll to satisfy my non-raw fish cravings, which the chef accommodated, but I definitely felt like I was cheating and the chef gave me what I perceived as a laughing look. Pricey but a definite must-go if you love sushi. I was so excited to find an open table at Shiro's on NYE. &#160;I had been reading rave review after rave review on this restaurant and was counting down the hours to dinner time all day long. When we arrived we were promptly seated and after perusing the menu we decided to order the Belltown Poke, the Cod Kasuzuke, as well as a variety of nigiri sushi. &#160;The poke and cod came quickly and both were very tasty. &#160;The poke had a nice flavor and the fish was fresh. &#160;The cod was silky and tasted better than any other cod kasuzuke that I had ever eaten before. Then came the nigiri sushi. &#160;Well, technically it came 30 minutes later leaving me slightly annoyed by the wait and even more disappointed at the quality. &#160;Do not get me wrong, the sushi was fresh...but it was poorly presented. &#160;The fish looked like it was cut quickly and without any care. &#160;They also managed to bring me an order of scallops which I did not order. &#160;They quickly rectified it by bringing me the salmon I had ordered but again the presentation was lacking. &#160;I will try them again and will play this experience up to being a fluke. &#160;Perhaps it was the hustle of NYE and the crowd forming at the door that caused this slip in service. &#160;But if it happens again I am going to have to wonder why so many people living in Seattle believe that they have to pay such high prices for such average sushi. Solid traditional Japanese restaurant. Small space. Great service. Funny sushi chefs. Smallish menu. Not too expensive. Good stuff. *Sigh* I miss this spot now that I ive on Capitol Hill. Came here last Wednesday, and the food was as good as I remembered. I tried some different thing aside fromjut rolls, though. The Poke Belltown was heavenly. The stir-fried geoduck was good, though it left an unusualaftertastein my mouth, not sure if from the spices if it's really the geoduck itself. The hiyayakko was good, though I think I overdid the soy sauce. And I *finally* tried the deep fried green tea tempuraice cream,which tasted as fantastic as it sounds :) Shiro's never dissapoint, definitely. If traditional sushi is what you're looking for, this is the place. &#160;By far the best fish in Seattle. &#160;Obviously the sushi is awesome, but I was sold when I found they have both broiled black cod and yellowtail collar. &#160;Two traditional dishes that everyone must try. Shiro's offers the perfect sushi experience. I came here on vacation and was encouraged to order omakase (chef's choice). I was lucky enough to get a seat at the sushi bar with Shiro the man himself serving me. All of the sushi was very authentic and served in the traditional style. He would prepare one thing at a time adjusting the menu and portions as the meal progressed. It is worth noting that the size of the pieces of sushi was perfect as well.The meal started with a salad consisting mostly of tuna. I tried several varieties of fish in the nigiri style sushi as well as shrimp tempura where he encouraged me to eat the entire thing including the head and it was delicious. I also tried some tempura uni (sea urchin) which was amazing, I've never had anything like it. The meal concluded with a hand roll that had an almost sweet flavor. All of the ingredients were so fresh and local such as Seattle's curious geoduck, amazing.The service was great. You order directly from the sushi chef as it should be unlike in most sushi bars where the chef barely says one word to the customers. As for price it is a little expensive, but so worth it for the quality of the food.I wish there was a place out here on the east coast half this good! If you're in Seattle definitely stop in for some of the best sushi you will ever find. Shiro truly is a master. Words cannot describe the quality of the sushi and the experience I was fortunate enough to partake in that day, I'll never forget it. Very fresh sushi here, with excellent service! &#160;Would be five stars for me EXCEPT...The prices are just too high.I guess this is a perfect example of location, location, location... Here in the heart of Belltown, I'm sure rents are expensive and that the prices will reflect that.That being said, this is probably better quality sushi than Kisaku, but too expensive for me to justify going there as often as Kisaku or Izumi (if I'm on the Eastside).So your decision to come here basically comes down to your company (this place isn't great for groups larger than five) and your budget. &#160;If you have money to burn and a small party, this is a great place.I wanted to try the omakase, but it was listed as $50 and up... So I went with the Sushi Dinner, which is 9 nigiri and 9 maki, chosen by the chef, so I went with it as a kind of mini-omakase. &#160;The selections were excellent, though I was disappointed with the basic tuna rolls that were chosen for six of the nine maki... I get that all the time anyway! &#160;But it was all so fresh and delicious.Enjoy the delicious and fresh fish, but come with your credit card ready to take a hit! This is a wonderful place if you are looking for fresh, amazing quality sushi. &#160;It is a little pricey but you get what you pay for. &#160; The tuna poke was wonderful and so was the asparagus appetizer. &#160;The sashimi melted like butter and the rolls were flavorful and not too big.This restaurant is small and quiet so if you are looking to socialize, this probably isn't the place for you. It is great for conversation and enjoying your food. My friends think I'm a bit of a sushi snob, and Shiro's is by far my favorite sushi restaurant in Seattle. &#160;You won't get fancy, creative roles here...what you'll get is high quality, fresh fish used for sashimi and nigiri.The way to go is to sit at the bar and have Omakase (chef's choice). &#160;I've been here a handful of times and the Omakase is a little different every time (once I had a toro and monk fish liver hand roll!!). &#160;Some of the nigiri is the typical fish, wasabi, and rice. &#160;Others have a great combination of various toppings (i guess it would be called) which compliment the fish perfectly - the sauce is never over powering. &#160;I enjoy Omakase because I get to taste things I usually don't order. &#160;I mean the sushi chefs at Shiro's can make mackerel taste good! ;-)Yes, Shiro's can get expensive, but you get what you pay for. &#160;I would say a typical Omakase runs ~$50 - $60 without drinks, but you do get a lot of sushi out of that price. &#160;Sometimes they like to mix a soup or some sort of hot dish into the Omakase. &#160;Watch out for these as they'll typically run nearly $10 per order - unless you want to try cooked dishes (their mushroom soup is amazing!), I typically try to stick to the sushi / nigiri.I heard rumors that Shiro sold this restaurant a few months ago, and as such, I think he works a short, modified schedule. &#160;However, the sushi there is still as good as I remember even when Shiro was there. For an authentic sushi experience - nothing is better in seattle than Shiro's. Hands down.Not only is the food fresh and tasty, using only the freshest of signature Seattle fish, but it is presented in a neat, formal, yet innovative form. It was crisp summer night, perfect for filling up on sushi. We sat at the bar (the only way to go here) and let the chef pic our feast. We tasted the normally sushi nigiri fare - yellowtail, salmon, unagi - but also had some of the more uncommon dishes such as copperriver salmon and a dish called kari saki. We were served a whole crab, but after we finished the chef filled up the crab shell with warmed sake! Now, I normally cannot handle too much sake, but within the briny walls of a crab - now that is how sake is meant to be drank.However, the food was great, the service was wonderful, it did not come at a cheap or even reasonable price - we certainly racked up a hefty bill for that fancy sake! All in all Shiros is an excellent, authentic sushi experience - for a pretty penny. So go to enjoy this meal when celebrating or if you just simply feel like indulging. Just promise me not to waste your dollars on California rolls! I originally was brought here by a vendor. And any sushi tastes great when it's on someone else's dime. However, after that first visit, I have been to Shiro's everytime I get to Seattle. This last trip, I read a review somewhere that suggested Shiro-san was retired so I was hesitant to go. It was late (9:30-ish pm) on a Friday night but I had to have Shiro's so I risked it. Lo and behold, there was the master Shiro-san in his usual spot behind the sushi bar. I asked him about the rumor and he said he is not retired; he just works 3 nights a week. As usual with Shiro-san, I went Omakase (chef's choice). To do anything different is ridiculous. If you go frequently enough, he usually remembers what you like/don't like and how adventurous you are. Shiro told me he doesn't use any flash frozen fish. Everything he gets is "fresh". And you can tell. Not a fishy taste ever. You don't even need teeth, as much of the sushi he serves just melts in your mouth, it is so fresh and so good. And if you do Omakase, you will usually get what is "in season." A few dishes not to miss, even if you do the sushi bar are the Tuna Poke and the Black Cod. These are signature dishes that are absolutely killer. If that was all you had, you will walk away a happy camper. Another dish that is a can't miss is the sweet shrimp, if it is in season. Shiro masterfully takes a live sweet shrimp; rips off it's head; filets the shrimp body and serves it to you within seconds. Can't get any fresher than that. Then he sends the heads to the kitchen where it comes back about 5 minutes later fried till it's crispy, antennae and all. I used to think it was disgusting, but nothing at Shiro's is disgusting. The head tastes like a shrimp chip, but better. The sushi experience at Shiro's is a culinary experience you have to try at least once. It is a bit pricey, but well worth the price in my opinion. This is a great place to try something for the first time as you'll know the ingredients are fresh and the best. If you don't like it here, you won't like it anywhere. For example, this last trip, Shiro-san had some Uni on the counter (sea urchin) the size of a football. He served me an Uni handroll that was just delicious and sweet. Not what I expected Uni to taste like at all. I was in Seattle and looking for a sushi bar. Shiro was suggested to me and so I decided to check it out. When I go out for sushi by myself I like to sit at the bar and let the chefs decide what I eat. This was the case here and I was not disappointed. &#160;Once they realized that I wanted to eat what THEY wanted to eat, they immediately got things rolling. &#160;Over the evening I tried everything they had to offer. The fish was extremely fresh, the craftsmanship and artistry were plainly evident, and the flavors were incredible. I would recommend Shiro to anyone looking for sushi in Seattle This place serves up wonderful sushi. &#160;Their seafood is very fresh, and the owners are extremely kind. &#160;If you can score a seat, be sure to check it out. absolutely delicious. small, traditional portions, respectable prices. the quality of the sashimi is extraordinary. My friends and I sat at the sushi bar and dined on the chef picked feast of sashimi sushi, otherwise known as omakase. &#160;I have to say that I expected the seafood to be more fresh than what I tasted but overall it was still a pleasant dining experience. &#160;One of the sushi chefs (not ours) was very nice and taught me that in Japan, you don't eat with chopsticks but rather you pick up the sushi with you hand (I'm still a bit skeptical as to whether this is true but I went along with it). &#160;So back to the freshness..more than half of what I ate was fresh but there were some where I wasn't sure if the seafood is suppose to be a bit fishy...but yeah, some were just too fishy for me. &#160;I would say that it doesn't compare to the likes of ushiwakamaru (nyc) but for the price, it was worth it! The food here is really fresh and I love their black cod kasuzuke is the best I've ever had! It's more like a traditional Japanese restaurant, so don't expect anything really Americanized. It is a bit out of my price range so I probably won't come back here. This place hands down is one of the best sushi places I've been to. The other one would be in San Diego. The service was great and the sushi chef was funny. He offered different styles for the nigri. Like with the salmon, he made slits in it and torched it. Almost like a tataki salmon, but just one side. Having it this way made it super soft and just melted in my mouth, yum. Everything I had that night was super fresh. How would I rate it? I'll fly back to seattle just to have some more. =) Most times I live and die by what is in Lonely Planet. &#160;This sushi place was recommended in their latest Seattle guide so I had to try it. &#160;It is traditional sushi. &#160;Don't get me wrong with the 3 stars . . . the sushi is great. &#160;I had to knock of a half star for the atmosphere because I need a little more than three awesome sushi chef's in back of the bar entertaining the patrons. &#160;Another half star was taken because although the sushi did deliver and what we had was outstanding, the menu wasn't very exciting. &#160;Very little simple choices. &#160;No creative rolls like you would hope. &#160;And finally, another full star for the price. &#160;I couldn't believe how expensive this place was. &#160; I've been to sushi joints all around the world and this place was the most I have ever paid for one piece of nigiri. The ubiquity of mediocre sushi that still costs a pretty penny makes me appreciate Shiro's all the more. &#160;Yes, it's not cheap, but to all those who blather on about how expensive Shiro's is - think about it in relation to how much not-so-great sushi restaurants charge!Shiro's is hands down, the best sushi I've ever had. &#160;It is at least several notches above your average neighborhood sushi joint, and I've been to my fair share of those. &#160;The star of the show here is the quality and freshness of the ingredients. &#160;Never mind about decor, selection -- no smoke and mirrors with fancily named rolls at Shiro's. &#160;The service is solid and unobtrusive. &#160;If you don't want to wait for a table and you want attentive service, get here early, like right when they open their doors for dinner. &#160;Otherwise, make a reservation.While it's not the place I'll go to every time I get a hankering for sushi, it is definitely the place to treat yourself or someone else for a special occasion. When friends come from out of town craving sushi, this is where I take them. &#160;Depending on the time of day, it can be hard to find a seat at the bar, but if you can, take the opportunity. Very fresh and yummy sushi, but a little pricey. &#160;I asked them for omakase for $40. &#160; They were very accomodating to include uni and exclude maguro &amp; unagi as I requested. &#160;All the sushi were fresh and they definitely broadened my sushi world as I wouldn't have ordered half the sushi that were on my plate. &#160;I don't even remember all the names of the sushi I had, but they were all great.I had to change it to 5 stars after last visit because by the 3rd visit, the wait staff remembered me and what I like. &#160;I really enjoy watching how much Shiro-san enjoys his work. &#160;Not all sushi chefs I've enocontered were as excited and enthusiastic as Shiro-san. &#160;Shiro's takes me back to Japan. &#160; Very happy place!! I'm very sad this place is in Seattle and nowhere near me. Sit at the bar and let the sushi chefs do their magic. They will keep serving up amazing pieces of nigiri until you say stop and trust me, it's not easy to say stop! The fish is so fresh and amazing, they'll just melt in your mouth. &#160;This place is a little on the pricey side, but it's all worth it! Service is really good here too and the sushi chefs are great! I miss this place already and I'm definitely coming back. One of my favourite sushi places downtown. &#160;Food is great, staff is super friendly and if you're lucky to get Koi as your waiter then you'll surely have a very entertaining time :)
An "a-ok" place for some happy hour beers, flan, and karaoke hosted by a one armed Dj. Our large group &#160;commandeered an indoor table, were greeted by a friendly waitress who told us if we waited 10 minutes it would be HH. She gave us menus and by the time we decided it was cheap food &amp; booze time. The cocktails looked tasty, but pricey ($8-13, depending on what you ordered, and only $1 off during HH) so I opted for a pint of summer ale and a anise-vanilla flan. The flan came with a giant "chocolate chip" (think potato chip kind of chip folks) and was absolutely lovely. It was gone in less than 3 minutes I think. Um, yeah -- it was ridiculously good and not overpowering in the anise department at all. My friend had her dessert comped because she kept ordering things they were out of, so that was nice. &#160;I nibbled on some key-lime cheesecake that was so so. Chips &amp; salsa were brought to the table and they were edible. Not offensive but nothing special.I glanced over the rest of their menu and it seems pricey for what you get -- but I suppose this is an "upscale Mexican" joint.The best part of the night was really the Karaoke though. The dj was still operating off of cd's so it took a bit of time between each crooner, but our group got our songs on and left with booze and desserts in our belly. This place is decently sized and the decor is nice and everything, however just not my cup of tea. &#160;Music selection was horrible this particular night, bathroom was one stalled, bartender was pushy. &#160;It would be wise to put a sign up that read "floors extremely slippery" because I fell on my ass. &#160;I wasn't wearing heals and I wasn't drunk and the floor didn't appear to be wet from spilled drinks--maybe just waxed or something--but nonetheless be careful. &#160;Place had maybe 15 people other than my party at best.I only had a few drinks here so I can't comment on the food, I doubt I will be going back, but never know. Fire pits= +Nice bartenders= +Expensive prices, migration of clientele from Peso's late night over 40+ frat fest, slow service and bad food (come on, who wants a cold beet salad with hot beets and melted cheese???)=MINUS MINUS MINUS Was really hoping to be able to give this place a better review than the others, because I like the idea of "upscale Mexican", but sadly I think the 2 star reviews are warranted.It started off fairly promising. We came in and were seated quickly by one of the bevy of wait staff fluttering around. Then we waited for a while before they even asked for drinks. She asked if our son wanted a straw (to which we said yes)... Then we waited an even longer while to get the drinks, and no straw. Then we waited a while before we could order - are you sensing the theme yet? But wait, it gets worse. The place started to get smokey (door closed + not awesome ventilation + fire in tables = smoke), which made my wife's eyes start watering. Then we waited nearly 30 minutes before the waitress came over and said, get this, that the printer in the kitchen ran out of paper so the cooks had just been standing around, and our food would be out shortly. She barely mustered an apology, and there was no offer of free drinks, a discount on our bill - and no chips and salsa or bread or anything to tide us over. Ridiculous.Did I mention that during this entire time the wait staff were either running around, folding napkins or confabbing in the back with each other? Plenty of time to be checking in if people needed more drinks or wondered where there food was.When the food finally arrived (15 minutes later) it was quite delicious (we shared the fish tacos and also green chili/steak enchiladas with cojita cheese). Beware that the appetizers are tiny and the entrees also smaller than you'd expect. The prices should have clued me in - but I'd recommend considering everything on the menu a "small plate" and ordering accordingly.I really hope the owners are reading this - your food is good (if small in proportion), but your service is amongst the worst I've experienced in Seattle. If you can't fix the latter, I won't be back and I suspect I'm not alone. I went there on a Friday night for dinner with a group of 7 people. We called ahead and they had room immediately to seat us which is why we chose that place. They had a table waiting with water, chips and salsa when we arrived. Everything else from there on was mediocre. I ordered a Margarita which was made with waaaayy to much cheap tequila and I couldn't taste any of the other mix. The Carne Asada was good but the chipotle mashed potatoes were cold when the food arrived. Everyone at the table ordered something different and no one was very impressed with the food. We told the waitress before we ordered that we needed separate checks and she said no problem and she could split them at the end. When we were done eating we waited a good 15 minutes for the plates to be removed from the table and another 20 for her to quietly drop the bill (all in one) on the table and not inform anyone. And there were numerous empty table so it's not like the place was slammed. One of the guys in the party had to walk over to the waitress station and remind her that we had asked for separate checks and to please split them again to which she replied "well that's going to be inconvenient for me". Yep, that's what a tip is for. when she came back to the table to retake our order she let the entire table know again that it was taking up her time and she was going to have to get the manager to do some work. While we're waiting for this a strobe/laser light turned on, as if they were trying to turn it into a club after 10. It was in my eyes the entire time we were waiting for the check debacle to be fixed and I was fearful that I would lose my eyesight. It didn't go with the theme of the restaurant at all. Bottom line, if you like mediocre food, bad margarita's and ok table service this is the place for you. otherwise I'd go somewhere else for a Mexican experience. It's a shame, I wanted to like this place, especially with it's prime location on Queen Anne hill. This place is probably the worst restaurant I have ever eaten in. Let me start by saying our server was awesome ... This 1 star is solely for the food and decor.I should have known when I saw the huge flat screens. I should have known when we were initially seated at the smallest (&amp; shortest) table ever. Next, the food coloring in the vases on the tables. BUT THEN ... They turned on a *light machine* that reflected red and green lights all over the diners ?????? The menu looked like "upscale Mexican." Akin to Matador or El Camino. Do not be fooled! I ordered halibut and it was piping hot, along with everything else on the plate. Obviously microwaved. It was like they didn't even try ... Bland and no flavor, cooked horribly. My husband had carnitas, and it came out in three huge chunks, covered in a weird green gravy. He never, ever complains about his hood but he actually spit it out and told them to take it away! The server told us that was the third time that had happened that night. Then why still serve it???Ugh. A total waste of a Saturday night out, which is few and far between now that we need to get a babysitter. So disappointing. I was hoping something decent would go in that doomed spot. Was a little disappointed with our food and drinks. The sopas were pretty good, but the other items we ordered were average at best. Stay away from their specialty cocktail list. Each one of us ordered a different drink from it (3 total), and each one was pretty terrible. The margarita (they have two different specialty margaritas, cant remember which one it was) tasted like salty sea water with a splash of bottle lime juice. Plus, the 3 drinks took FOREVER. And we were one of only 3 tables in the whole place (was later at night, around 11:00) If you get a drink, I'd stick with either beer or a regular mixed drink -- hard to mess those up.Probably a good place to watch a sports game -- lots of big tv's around the place, which gives it a much more definitive bar feel instead of a restaurant.Outdoor sidewalk seating, which is a plus for warm days. hmm, glad I didn't read most the other reviews on here before my visit to La Luna or it may never have happened. &#160;That's how much i depend on you, my fellow Yelpies.Here's my 2 cents...what drew me in, the fires outside! Love that you can sit outside and have your own little fireplace. Tres romantique. Lol though because we sat inside this first time. ( i get cold easily and it was 8:30ish...)We had multiple service come by, making sure we had water and if we had any questions about the menu. We started off with our #1 measure of what makes a good mexican restaurant, their scratch margueritas. My bf got the reposado one...CHECK!! it was oceany, sweet and limey with essence of some good tequila. Then, I ordered my first ever WHITE sangria because I was in between getting a full on cocktail but not sassified with just a glass of wine. &#160;Highly recommend folks! No, serious, I don't care for red sangria much but now I'm all giddy for the white version. Really, ask the manager fella to make you one. Okay, what we ordered food wise:we actually just got two appetzers because we are trying not to enlarge ourselves...BUT, we got the fish tacos, says two on the menu for $6.50 but the waitress said it was a typo because you actually get four! &#160;They were good, really good. Great fresh tasting mahi mahi with a little jalapeno kick here and there. Then we also ordered the seared tuna,..again, quite tasty.The manager fella told us about the s'mores thing they do but we left right near start time. We plan on going back for sure, for some entrees, outdoor fireside seating and them s'mores. :-) Ditto Joshua B., since I was with him, I had pretty much the same experience &amp; won't re-hash it. I will just say that while our waitress &amp; the server were nice enough, they just seemed inexperienced. Like in that way where they say the same thing with a smile on their face, "OK, great", "Sure no problem", "It'll be just a minute"...vs. actually engaging in any real conversation or authentic commentary. Having been to this location before (when it was Opal), I will say I think the layout contributes to the difficulty of the waitresses/servers. It is an interesting concept - but unless you are on the upper level by the bar, I think it is hard for them to see if you are trying to make eye contact, etc...Also there are 4 (or more) large screen TVs on the wall, which kind of contradicts the rest of the environment. Having said that, Kung Foo Panda was playing on one screen which helped keep the kiddo entertained during our lengthy wait for food. Various sports on the other screens. Anyway - the food was great. I could have had several more items, but was not interested in waiting another 1/2 hour for 2 entrees (and my eyes couldn't stand the smoke for another minute). I'll be watching these reviews &amp; if it trends up, I'll try again. I hope they can stay open long enough! I really hope the owner reads these reviews. I also hope that they are still just working out the kinks of a new place, because I actually do like La Luna. If I was reviewing this on food alone, it would get 4 stars. I have already been here 4 times. Had drinks and food 3 times. However the last time I didn't eat there. Or drink there. Or do anything there, because we were seated at a table and were never spoken to again. We kept giving sad hungry eyes to the SEVERAL waitress that walked near our table, with no response. So we waited. Then a group of FIVE that were seated AFTER us received water, drinks, and their food orders were taken. That's when we got up and left. For such a small place, it seems unnecessary to have 6 or 7 waitresses there at a time. But it is just strange to have all of them running around (when the place is not even close to full) and receive such terrible service. The other 3 times I ate/drank here the service was slow, but not nearly as bad as the last time. Other little complaints/notes: The waitresses should at least know a little bit about alcoholic beverages (she didn't know what "neat" meant) The first time we went, when we asked for water (yes, we had to ask) we received nice big glasses of WARM water. Really? The menus are filled with typos. Normally I wouldn't care (or probably even notice) but when you are sitting there with nothing else to do for 20 minutes, you notice these things. The drinks are pricey, but the food is cheap. So I figure it averages out. Like I said, I hope things change, because I like the food and I don't mind the decor (although the several TVs really do seem out of place). They keep changing things (happy hour menu, glasses, drinks) so it makes me think they are trying to find their groove. I hope they find it. I'll check back in a month. I have been to La Luna a few times for some late night Queen Anne drinking, but I decided to make it an actual destination on a Thursday for a night of both food and drink. Right from the get go I kept thinking to myself, "This reminds me of an episode of Kitchen Nightmares!" I kid you not, there were 3 different versions of a menu floating around, with totally different offerings on each version. It just seems like they are very disorganized with the kitchen/food management at this place. Might want to eat first, and stick to late night boozing at La Luna, esp. if you love tequila! This place gets two stars strictly based on the fact that it has good tequila + karaoke = a match made in heaven! &#160; Pros:Good tequila selectionNice bartendersKaraoke (Thursday)Cons:Food was weakDisorganized menu Dear La Luna,Let me start by saying I really want to like you. However when the once pint sized Margarita have been replaced with ones 1/3 their size for the same price, I get sad. It still takes 10 minutes for the bartender to get them made. Please bring back the big cups so we can leave your bartender alone.Your food is awesome and the only thing decently priced. I will say I believe the food to be creative and well executed. The atmosphere with the fire tables make me smile. Please La Luna, just mend the drinks so I can be the drunken local I aspire to be We came here on a sunny Sunday to enjoy some mimosas, enchiladas, tacos and s'mores.The steak enchiladas verdes: I have no idea if that's what they're called but they were green enchiladas filled with steak. The steak was tender and flavorful and the sauce was delicious!The tacos tinga: Tinga is my very favorite mexican dish. I love the chipotle and tomato flavor that theirs has and the chicken was shredded breast meat. YUM!The service was really great! Our server, Hugo, gave us plenty of attention and was super nice and gave us great recommendations for food choices.Great spot to enjoy some Mexican food and a cocktail or two (don't forget the s'mores!). We stopped by for happy hour on Monday and I don't think we'll be going back. We were looking for happy hour (it was just before 5 o'clock) and the happy hour here is really a rip off. To me- Happy Hour is all about value. It's a way to experience a place without committing to a full meal. Not much value here..... House cocktails are $1 off during HH. This means the margarita goes from $10 to $9 (for one small ass margarita). Clearly not a good HH deal. Other cocktails are $11 and $12. Cheapest HH drink was $7.Place was mostly empty (some old people drinking Manhattans and us really) and- as many other yelpers have noted- the interior is basically the same as the late Opal/Flow (R.I.P)- with the addition of the fireplace and the 3 offensively large- and completely out of place- TVs in the corner. We checked out the food menu and it seems OK. Reasonably priced ($8-$16)- and some tasty looking things. I'm a sucker for Mole..... and they've got it. Service was fine. Apps are $2 off during happy hour- but we were bummed by the drink prices- so we decided to go somewhere else after our one pricey cocktail for a bite to eat (where the drinks would be more reasonably priced). If this place wants to survive- they're going to have to do something different to draw people in. Meh. Underwhelmed. The best thing I can say about La Luna is that it's not terrible. Much like another reviewer on here, I really came hoping for good things. As a local QA resident, I've seen this place turnover so many times that I was praying and hoping something good would finally show up. I guess I'm still waiting.The service was ok at best. The greeters seemed to do a fine job but the waitstaff was a bit on the slow side. I'm willing to give them some slack on the service since they are a relatively new place and I realize they are still getting things on track ... The food, on the other hand, is an entirely different story. The food is not bad but, again, that's the best thing I can say. The seared tuna was hardly worth the effort, the corn soup tasted thin and bland, the chicken mole was passable. Purely in terms of food, if I'm hankering for Mexican, I'll probably just go to the other end of the block and eat at Tenoch.The one reason I might come back here, however, is for a drink and to watch a baseball game. They've got a lot of TV's for such a small space and the overall design is pleasant enough. My one concern is that they might be trying a bit too hard to be Peso's north ... and perhaps if I were ten years younger ... and ten years dumber then I might have some interest in hanging out at meat markets but since I'm not ... well, let's just say that La Luna strikes me as a decent enough place that's bordering on being downright annoying. Of course, if they improve their menu then I might reconsider but from what I've tasted, they've got a while to go. Why oh why can't this location survive? &#160;After sitting at a bar table for 10 minutes with not ONE person addressing my existence, I went to the bar and asked for a menu. Another 10 minutes and .... nothing. &#160;i got up and left. &#160;Where are the owners? &#160;Why aren't they there teaching their staff how to properly wait on their guests? &#160;Unbelievable. &#160;Didn't even get to the 'food' part as the welcome and service were so poor. &#160;come on folks, it is NOT that hard.Owners -- whoever you are -- get in there and make this place work. &#160;You have a clientele that is happy to pay the price; we just want some service and some good food. I highly recommend taking someone you dislike here because you'll get a lot of satisfaction making them experience this place. I really wanted to like La Luna because I just moved into a new place nearby. The curb appeal is great with the fire tables, which is enough to draw you in. But like a moth to the flame, you're only going to get burned. The servers were far less than cordial and seemed inexperienced. Not once did they ask how our overpriced drinks were, which took long enough to arrive. We only received the chips and salsa after another server, not our own, stopped by to ask. The food was portioned small and lacked flavor or any resemblance to Mexican food. It was at least warm, which is more than I can say of the service. Overall I want them to get the kinks worked out so they can succeed, but until then, I'll be frequenting the other great Queen Anne restaurants that actually have their act together. Possibly the worst service ever. I am never coming back. Pros:Cheap foodCons:Mediocre foodWaitress had to be reminded 2x to bring waterI asked the waitress about the soup (was it vegetarian), she had to ask the chef but forgot and never came backMy drink came out 10 minutes after my friends' even though the restaurant was more than half-emptyShe brought tacos to my friend who ordered a quesadillaShe overcharged me $1 for my drink on the billHalfway through dinner, they started up a disco ball type contraption that shined green and red lights throughout the restaurant (this was ~9:30pm, so sort of late, but still, very weird)The bartender was obnoxiously loud and would periodically yell (he was entertaining a small group of very inebriated patrons at the bar) I had high hopes, and it's not a bad place. It's just not great either. The food is fine. It's much more of a bar than a restaurant, with your entree coming out without rice, beans, or any side. There's definitely a good crowd, so if you're looking for that, it's a good place. I want to like it, and I think it will do pretty well, but I'm not a huge fan. Small, awkward tables that you can't put your legs under and have to hunch over to eat. Friendly staff who seem to be trying to fix the slow service issue. Has a Matador feel or Pesos feel, but doesn't pull it off as well. Prices are reasonable enough to where I'll probably go again for drinks and appetizers. Eek. We were so pumped for La Luna. As top-of-Queen-Anne-hill residents, we love when new places open and root for them to succeed. The place was packed when we walked by Thursday evening around happy hour and the outdoor seating area with flame centerpieces got us all riled up about La Luna's potential. We scoped out the menu and decided to try their brunch the next day.Talking about how ahhh-mazing 5 Spot is on the way to eat somewhere else for brunch is probably never a good idea. We were the only table in the place - panic! We immediately ordered Bloody Mary's and inquired about the pastries - yes, they are made in house, which is a good selling point. Apparently, the bartender wasn't around to make the drinks, so our sweet server whipped up some super strong ones and told us they were on the house because they might not be right and they took forever. The best description we came up with for the food that was served was hotel food. Holiday Inn Express type hotels - you know, the kind that is there if you want it... but you kinda want to go to IHOP before you get on the road... but you order an omelet anyway and it's cold and the cheese is weird when you get it so you just eat toast and a yogurt... that feeling. My friend's ham and cheese omelet was incredibly flat and disappointing, my scrambled eggs were meh, the crab cake benedict was blah, and the crepes were "nothing to call France about", according to another friend.All in all, the staff was very nice and I am still rooting for La Luna's dinner menu - but brunch needs to turn it up about 600 notches in order to satiate our spoiled Toulouse/5 spot/Emmer &amp; Rye palates. Or really, any palate that wants its eggs served warm. I didn't think that they were very good at all. Admittedly, they were short-staffed, but we kept having to actively flag down our waitress. The salsa tastedncooked. The tortilla chips were stale. The skin on my chicken was soggy (ick!). My companion doused his dish with hot sauce in order to spice it up. At least we didn't get food poisoning, the decor was adequate, the wine list was interesting, and our waitress was spunky. I'm disappointed to see so many negative reviews on here, so I thought I would chime in. &#160;I came here last week with a large group of people and we all had a blast! &#160;The food was AWESOME! I shared the fish tacos and the mole enchiladas with my friend, and although I'm embarrassed to admit, there was not a bite left on either plate. The drinks were delicious, although a bit heavy on ice for the price. &#160;Our server was lovely, and so patient with our entire group. I would give this place an enthusiastic two thumbs up! I am a queen anne local and was a loyal la luna customer till finding out the whole staff up and quit. I would have quit too, the food has gotten worse, the music is more obnoxious and cheesier than ever. Last time I was in, a middle aged man was the only one working with more tables than he could obviously handel, where is the manager to this place!!? Come to find out all my favorite servers quit, Good for them, after hearing all the horror stories about that shady place i hope they get the respect they deserve from somewhere else. Someone better turn that place around, and quick. When all your own employees turn on you, that should tell you something. You've lost my support. I will not be back What is going on with the 2 stars?! Okay, so maybe they are still working out the kinks a bit. 4 stars from me because I've been here so much and the food needs to be a little more consistent, but I think they'll get there! The staff has great energy and the atmosphere is great! As soon as the fish tacos are the same every time I order them I'll change my review to a 5. Everything else I've eaten has been great! Horrible! Service is slow and food is bland. I nearly threw up after biting into a huge piece of grisle in the cold, chicken enchiladas; yes served cold with a lackluster sauce. The chicken tasted the way boiled chicken smells...The fish tacos were equally as disgusting, visually disturbing.The salsa is not homemade and is suspiciously identical to Fonterra, jarred salsa sold at Safeway. You can't make a good Mexican restaurant if you can't even make salsa!It will not last long, that's for sure. My wife and I have been here twice. &#160;We both tried hard to really like this place and reverse the curse of the corner joint that used to be Flow and before that, Opal. &#160;The service was slow, the food was marginal, and the margaritas where BAD! &#160;La Luna showed promise, but I'm not willing to risk another night out at this place. &#160;That's too bad since we're locals and within walking distance. &#160;Heed the other reviews. I'm going to make this short and sweet. We came in sat down on a Saturday night waited 5 minutes to get a menu. &#160;We waited 5 more minutes without service. As we got up to leave the server was approaching out table. Not good guys. We won't be coming back. This place seems very cool from the outside looking in.Upon entering restaurant, we noticed it was LOUD, and smokey from the fire pit. The host said we would have a 20 minute wait, though tables were open. I asked if we could sit outside, where in saw an open table, she sat us there. Our table was out of propane. &#160;We were cold. Realizing Queen Anne is a small neighborhood, instantly acquaintances were stopping by to say hello. Next this VERY drunk man sits at our table, and starts speaking Spanish to my friend. Apparently, HE owns this place! &#160;Romero. What I didn't understand was the content of their conversation. Romero told my friend we wanted me as his lover. She told him NO. Romero gets up from the other side of table and gets behind me, and my chair, and hugs me, rubs his face all over my face and his lips land smack dab on mine. NOT COOL. I told him NO. Felt uncomfortable instantly. He continued to invade my personal space. I told him I have a boyfriend, and No. He said that he didn't care. He then tried lighting the fire at our table, but was too drunk to figure it out. We asked to move seats. I wish I would have asked for the check then and just left. That would have been the right thing to do. My friend told him he was drunk and out of control. She told him he cannot act this way, especially as a business owner. He was then swept off by another woman... Kissing, touching... Though we could see she was just as uncomfortable as I, as she was kicking her friend under the table.Please don't spend your money here.This is my first ever review. Typically, I am optimistic and would never think to leave a bad review over someone's dream/creation job. I was so upset leaving last evening. Couldn't believe the madness. I woke up this morning knowing it was my responsibility to protect future female patrons from violation of their own bodies.The service was slow, But our server was friendly and kind. The place was so loud we could not have a conversation. The bartenders were drinking on the job,intoxicated while serving. blowing fire, slamming a cutting board on the bar loudly many times over. and the bartender &#160;kept turning &#160;the rap music up louder and louder. Mind you this is at 7:30pm. I wondered what other local businesses thought of la luna? Truly felt like we were in a disco dance club. We had to ask our server for everything: water, to order drinks, to order dinner, our silverware, the check... &#160;When we asked about the status of our dinner, our server said that the guys in the kitchen would YELL at her if she asks for it before it's ready. &#160;space seems very chaotic. La Luna restaurant is out of control. Crazy. Loco. The owner is a drunk. I asked the server if he is typically like this, and she said yes, that they need to talk to him about this. I own a local business here on queen anne hill. This is enuf to ruin a reputation. Unacceptable behavior of the owner.Margaritas were expensive, and served in a small glass. &#160;Food wasn't bad.I will never return. I would highly suggest you don't waste your time or money. I'm confused. From open to around 10:30/11 La Luna is a neighborhood eatery filled with couples of all ages, families and 20-30 yr-old something's enjoying a drink in the bar. When the sun goes down the families scatter, the Black Eyed Peas get thrown on the stereo and a disco ball comes out of seemingly nowhere (was that at laser I just saw??). And then, the tequila poppers start. Popper are a mix of coffee liquor, 7-Up and well tequila, shaken and then slammed on the bar. Fun once or twice but this sound get's really old after hearing it, on average, 10 times each hour. On my first visit I sat at the bar with a girlfriend. The bartender convinced us to try one of his cocktails made with rum....even though we told him we didn't like rum. His promise to change our minds failed and his suggestions for a follow-up drink (after we told him that his first really wasn't what we had in mind) also failed. After not getting through drink 2 he offered to replace it with a third try. We ordered beer and our bill. He charged us for all three and refused to remove any of them. Bad taste in my mouth literally and figuratively. I've been back a couple of times since then and had spotty service, average food...and I'm still confused about what they're going for as far as ambiance. Let's be honest though, I'll be back. It's a bar two minutes from my house and I hear they have s'mores.... Maybe 2.5 stars. &#160;We were hoping to find a 4 star Mexican food joint on the hill. &#160;Not to be. &#160; Our server Judy was great. &#160;We even had a couple of other people drop by with chips, water. &#160;In fact, those chips and salsa were very good. &#160;It's always nice to be able to sit outdoors on those rare sunny Seattle days. &#160;This is a nice place for doing that. &#160;It's the food that is not so nice. &#160;I think when you have an $11. sandwich that is advertised as made on ciabatta that is how it ought to be served. &#160;Instead we had mediocre whole wheat bread. &#160;I appreciate the fresh fish with no batter and breading. &#160;I only wish it had some flavor. &#160;Adding salt at the table didn't help much either. &#160;The mango salsa was refreshing. &#160;It could benefit from a bit of heat. &#160;Maybe more cilantro? &#160;The plate of black beans with a dash of cojito was as unappealing as any dish we've recently been served. &#160;The prices would indicate a higher level of food that isn't realized here. &#160;We shall continue to search QA for better Mexican fare. This was by far the most disappointing restaurant experience I have ever had. My fiance and I finally got a chance to go out for dinner together and decided to try this place based off the nice looking outdoor fireplaces and inviting atmosphere. The atmosphere is probably the only good thing about this place. Upon entering there was a hostess that was extremely flustered and freaking out that two other couple where in line and there was a 5 minute wait, she looked at us as if we were bothering her by trying to get a seat, then she told us to seat ourselves. about 30 minutes later we asked someone if we could please have a waiter take our order, they got annoyed but eventually sent someone over. After we ordered we waited another 30 minutes to get our food. I was hoping the food could make up for the service, I was wrong, for $15 I got 4 pieces of really tiny prawns served with a huge amount of filler food (rice and beans) that weren't seasoned and tasted like they came out of a can, it was awful. My fiance got a salad for $10 that was small enough to be a plate for a 3 year old. After we ate it took FOREVER to finally get our waitress back to get our check and when she brought us the bill it said $78.00 !!!! we didn't even order drinks, she had charged my card for another tables meal and then charged it again for our meal, I still haven't had the almost $80.00 extra dollars taken off of my bank statement. To make it even worse she never returned to apologize and instead sent a bus boy to solve the problem, and walked past our table without even glancing at us. The service was appalling and I wouldn't eat here again if it was free. If it weren't for our server Ally and the fact that the food was very good, we probably wouldn't go back. &#160;La Luna has been open now about 6-8 weeks and still has a lot of bugs to work out. &#160;We stopped in for brunch around 10:45am and expected to be able to order bloody mary's with our brunch. &#160;No bartender on duty - what???? &#160;There's a full bar there!! &#160;Did I mention they actually opened for breakfast at 7:30am? &#160;Apparently the bartender had called shortly after we first sat down, but never showed. &#160;Oh, and no one else, not a server, chef, anyone could even technically pour a mimosa. &#160;At 11:30 another server showed up, and we overheard her asking the only other server if "she was ok for awhile since she needed to run an errand". &#160;By this time there were 5 full tables. &#160;While I think they could probably get their scheduling act together and/or hire responsible and dependable staff, they probably have a long way to go. &#160;Menu looks great, each item the 3 of us ordered for brunch was very good, but be prepared to wait - at least for now. &#160;Having said that, I might try them again in a month or so when they've had a chance to staff appropriately and timely. This place just isn't that good! I've given it several attempts for them to redeem themselves and they just can't pull it together. Chips were old and stale every time!! The food can be ok, nothing that special. However, I did like their drinks. Needless to say I don't think I'll be back. As my first review ever on yelp, I wish I could rave about what a great dining experience I had. &#160;However, it was the deplorable exerience I had here that got me motivated to write this review. &#160;First, we got seated at what could only be the kids table for dinner. &#160;There were four in our party, the two that had to sit in the booth against the bar were place completely away from the table. &#160;The table was shorter than knee high for everyone, meaing nobody at the table could put their legs under the table. &#160;We all ordered margharitas, they came after too long of a wait and were watered down or sans tequlia all together. &#160;And for $10, you expect a little tequlia in your drink. &#160;Food was ok, carne asade for me, over cooked for the medium rare I asked for. &#160;The worst part of the night was the bar scene. &#160;If this is going to be a neighborhood dining and drinking establishment you can't allow what I can only assume was the owner or the manager's nephew's fraternity to have a party. &#160;We had dudes in cutoff shirts and backwards hats hugging and wrestling with each other, pushing chairs over, drinking all the tequlia for our drinks, yelling and screaming like we were on frat row. &#160;We couldn't ask for our check quick enough. &#160;All of this and not one word or move by any one of the staff to remedy the situation. &#160;Sad. an amazing place for ppl like me - who hang out at the bars.. sit down quietly, watch a game and get drunk before heading back to ur hotel-room.. the bartender was great.. he had all these wild experiments going on and they turned out pretty good actually.. awesome guy!!.. surprisingly they forgot abt the fact that I ordered fish-tacos .. but thats fine - a minor hiccup.. I had a great time.. and I'm definitely going back there since I know when their slowest days are.. Great food. Great decor. Great service. Popped in here on a Sunday night since I have a friend that works here and she recommended it (she wasn't working that night, so no bias here). It was half-empty, but still had an energetic vibe. There's fire on one of the tables and fire on the tables outside - it'll be awesome in the summer for evening margaritas. Good cocktail list and a decently sized menu. I had the carnitas, and while the meat was a bit fatty, it was cooked to perfection and the flavors were spot-on. Not wanting a cocktail, I ordered a beer (they have a pretty limited selection on tap but I'm hoping that will change soon) and our server warned me that they had some trouble with the taps staying cold, so if my beer was too warm I could get something else. When the beer arrived, it was borderline lukewarm, but I didn't want anything else so I told her I'd just deal with it, no big. She took it off my bill anyway. That was awesome. I also liked that they let the servers wear things that showed their tattoos - as someone who's worked in food service, I really appreciate businesses that don't try to hide their workers' individuality. I'm not sure why the TVs are there - I guess it's to expand their clientele so they can function as a sports bar on occasion if they want to - but it does detract from the vibe somewhat. However, with a great, affordable menu and good service, this is shaping up to be a good neighborhood spot. We stopped in on a sunny Sunday evening and were gretted by a very friendly hostess, who informed us the wait for an outdoor table was 30 minutes - not bad at all. But the problem was the inside was so oppressively hot, I wouldn't have even wanted a drink at the bar. And I was only at Flow once, but I swear they changed nothing inside... So the hostess took our number and we returned when called.After being seated, someone came by and said, "Here's some water while you're reading the menus" and then took a drink order. Surprisingly, this was our waitress - no greeting whatsoever. It wasn't like they were slammed, but I'll let this go. What I won't let go is the ridiculously long time it took for those drinks to arrive. Not happy. My Tijuana Tap Water was quite good though.We ordered and the menu is quite reasonable for entrees - not so much for apps, which average about the same price as entrees. I had the carnitas, my girlfriend had the mole enchiladas, and both portions were rather small, but enough to fill you up. The enchiladas come with no rice or beans though? The problem is the food was just okay - nothing special, nothing awful. Certainly not worth a 30-minute wait when there's another decent Mex place right down the block.All in all, if you have an evening to spend, give it a shot, but it won't knock your socks off. Things to look out for before dining/drinking at La Luna1. Service is slow 2. Waitresses have about as much charisma/charm/intelligence as chalkboards.3. Food is decent and definitely edible but not out of this world. A solid 6. Ambiance is their biggest issue. From the outside the place looks cute but inside, it looks like an airport sports bar. Also there are the saddest looking carnations on every table. It is also extremely echoey/loud and when I ate their, they were playing the "Chris Brown Pandora channel" (according to the waitress). This made the experience all the more immature and lowbrow. There are so many great places to get Mexican in Seattle (or just food in general). SAVE your money and your time and don't come to La Luna. Something did change here.At first, the service was awesome, we were always served promptly with drinks and food, and the food was FANTASTIC.Then, a bunch of people got fired, the service went down and the food was bland. I'm hesitant to go back. Last time I was there, we sat on the patio, it took about 15 minutes to get a drink. and another 15 for a refill. I ordered the quesadilla as I always do and for the first time it was just...bland. I wanted salt. lots of it.I'll try it one more time, then off to Trago. Awesome happy hour! &#160;The food was great and the service was awesome. This is a great place to go and get drinks or an appetizer with friends or loved ones if your in the neighborhood and want a nice place to sit and catch up. I will definitely go back for happy hour again and try dinner in the near future! I love this place. &#160;I always get great service. &#160;The silver margaritas are to die for. &#160;The fish tacos are incredibly fresh and amazing. &#160;The people are friendly and the prices are reasonable.I am so excited to have this on Queen Anne and have become a frequent visitor. They need to hire a bartender, because when I was Terence the manager was tending bar. &#160;He was trying hard and was very nice, but could not make a drink. &#160;He actually ask what was in a Gin and tonic.The food was pretty good, chicken was a bit dry and lacked any real flavor. &#160;The chorizo however was fantastic. &#160;And the pickled carrot wad so good I wanted a bowl full.I a little work, this place could work. TERRIBLE service. &#160;Bad food. &#160;Sad, because seems like it has potential. &#160;Went to dinner with a friend. &#160;We had to actually had to get up and wave after 15-20 minutes from being sitted to get some service. &#160;Chips and salsa was supposed to be coming, it never showed. &#160;When we finally ordered, the waiter was somewhat apologetic (thus 1 star...). &#160;When the food came it was coagulated and cold. &#160;This place is a disaster. &#160;I don't think we'll ever go again, unless there are some drastic changes. &#160;Such a shame because it has a great location, and seems to have so much potential. &#160;Maybe that is a cursed corner. oh dear. &#160;Where to begin -- how about the end, where we got to walk out without seeing the bill, not having to leave a tip, having finally gotten them to properly input our Living Social certificate number. &#160;That was after 3 attempts during our 1.5 hour of sitting, ordering, waiting for delicious multicolored chips &amp; salsa, waiting for a drink menu, never seeing an appetizer menu, never getting to order a cocktail, the wrong meal arriving for Kid Numero Uno, delicious chicken enchiladas (4 for $12?!!) smothered in a yummy mole sauce arriving for El Senor and completely devoured (can I use my fingers to scrape up any remnant of chocolatey sauce? &#160;Or is it ok to lift the plate to my tongue like a bull standing over a gored matador?). &#160;We did get comped a huge luscious square of Mango Cake, to do battle with the huge dense square of Chocolate Cake that we ordered. &#160;None else of the 8 dessert items were available. &#160;I'm not disappointed, just saying. &#160;Order the Mango Cake and die happy.Oops, I just saw Britt's review from el dia ante ayer (9/11/11) panning the service too. &#160;Another bad night. &#160;Wow. &#160;Sweet servers, but no idea how to serve. &#160;It wasn't busy, but the table behind me was complaining too, kindly, inquiring why the plates came out willy nilly uncoordinated, disorganized, haphazard. &#160;Nice place, but we finished last.One fun suggestion: sit inside next to the window. &#160;That way you can be inches away from the outdoor tables, separated by a pane of glass, and see what they ordered. &#160;I'll have what she's having. What is your worst nightmare? In this case, it is La Luna. While I was excited to try a new restaurant with my girls on a Friday and filled with hope for the ever-changing corner of Boston &amp; Queen Anne.....our hopes literally almost went up in flames. Let's start at the beginning.One of the water glasses on the table, had a large chip. While it was it brought attention of the waitress, she was confused at the request for a new cup and gave us a quizzical look. The replacement glass had no ice and water was tepid. Needless to say, it was not touched for the remainder of the meal. As we were seated at a lengthy table, we requested a second bowl of salsa, which our waitress, again gave us a quizzical look. She had to come back to clarify exactly what we were asking for. Details, details.Let me be straight. The food was good. However, greatly overshadowed by the following events. As we were contently eating our dinner, we noticed a creepster groping other female patrons. The inappropriate behavior continued at an outside table, as he groped another female customer and then kissed her on the lips. That particular table ended up moving to a nearby table because the propane was "out" for their fire pit. He then proceeded to attempt to remove the tank, while waving a lighter around. This act seemed alarming, to say the least, since we were scared that there could be an explosion. We were the ones who had to notify other waitstaff, who then rushed out to remove him from the situation. It wasn't until we were waiting for our check, that we realized the creepster was the owner. We mentioned being uncomfortable to our waitress and she confirmed that he was in fact intoxicated and she did not feel she was able to say anything to him. Of course, my group was appalled. We informed her that due to his inappropriate and disgusting behavior, we would not be returning to this establishment. She said, "don't blame the server."On our way out, we approached the owner and expressed our discontent with his actions. He was too blacked out to truly understand what was being said to him but responded, "what's wrong with treating women like that". His loss. Bottom line: Don't go to La Luna. I wish zero stars was an option. Horrible experience. Food is mediocre at best, margaritas tasted like they use Mrs T's mixer from the grocery store. Waitress swore at us and told the manager we didn't leave a big enough tip after we received terrible service. Manager has no understanding of how to provide customer service- kicked my friend out and called her names based only on the waitress' complaint. Only after I mediated and explained it was the waitress who started throwing out names did he apologize to my friend. He refused to apologize to the rest of our group, and accused me of "threatening" him when I promised I, or any of my friends, would never frequent his business again. This review helps fulfill that promise. Went back for more Margies, and to try some food. I love a place that will make accomodations for my food preferences. I am not a picky eater at all, I love food, but I try to avoid certain foods. I made a special request when I orderd my tacos and the chef came out personally to make sure he knew what I wanted. &#160;When my chorizo tacos came out I was really happy. they not only tasted great but they were just what I wanted. Terrible service and bad food. &#160;It took 3 times of asking to get a glass of water, and it was 4pm, there were only 4 tables of people in the place. &#160;We ordered chicken tacos, and there was nothing on them but very wet shredded chicken with mild flavoring. &#160;It was beyond bland. &#160;I also had some friends that went there the same night. &#160;They each opened a tab at the bar, and the bartenders gave their cards to other people. &#160;They never got their cards back and the other patrons that took their cards continued to go drinking all over Seattle that night and racked up over $200 in bar charges, elsewhere. &#160;NICE! &#160;And it happened twice on the same night. &#160;Basically NEVER open a tab at that bar. Well....what to say. &#160;We've lived on QA and seen several restaurants come and go at this prime location. &#160;When we heard that La Luna was moving in, we gave it some time to work out the kinks...guess we didn't give it long enough.We called earlier in the day to make a reservation, and were told that they do not take reservations. &#160;So, when we showed up without a reservation, we were told that we should have made reservations. &#160;Huh? &#160;After telling the hostess that we tried, she said they must have been really busy when we called. &#160;Again, huh?We waited approx 30 minutes for our drink order to be taken once we were seated outside. &#160;Another 10 minutes later when our margaritas arrived, it was if if they forgot to add the sour mix. &#160;All of us asked that they be remade--clearly something was not right. &#160;The second round was better, but still lacked that traditional margarita tang. &#160;Heck, if you can't get the ritas right in a Mexican joint, how good can the rest of the meal be? &#160;After another 20-30 minutes of waiting for our orders to be taken, both the appetizers and the meals arrived at the same time. &#160;Really? &#160;completely unacceptable! &#160;The appetizers were terrible, and the apples were completely forgotten on the apple/beet cheese plate.3 of us ordered the enchilada mole, and not one of us thought they were good. &#160;The fourth member of our party ordered the shrimp, and admittedly, was the best of the bunch. &#160;The mole was flat, not at all complex, and frankly, just not good. &#160;The shrimp, however, was spicy, tangy, and quite good.We couldn't bear to order desert, as we had been sitting there for 2+ hours.I've no doubt that this restaurant will go the way of the others. &#160;I just hope it goes sooner rather than later so that we can hopefully get something decent in this "cursed" location. Ok, I am amending my review for this new place. &#160;I think there was a significant management change here, things are radically different. &#160;It is way too loud, and the owners seem to be confused about what kind of neighborhood they are in. &#160;Not many frat houses around here! &#160;But, if you like loud bars, with both music and tv, this is the place for you. &#160;That is why I say just A-ok, 'cause it is ok for some. &#160;None of my people like this place anymore. &#160;So, without Mexican food again until this amazing place opens...on Queen Anne Ave...soon. The first time, we came here after a visit to the QA farmers market. In search of a delicious margarita and some tacos we left extremely disappointed. My boyfriend's Chicken Mole came out looking like it has sat under the heat lamps for 30+ minutes. My friend's vegetarian tacos (potatoes + avodcado, pretty simple) came out without the avocado. We decided to give this place another shot recently knowing that it was new upon our first visit and maybe they had worked out the kinks. Again, we left disappointed. I will say that the place has potential. The ambiance is fantastic. Rudest. Dining. Experience. Ever. Wish I had read some of these reviews earlier, but alas, we wandered in unprepared for what was to come.We are a middle-aged couple (oh, the horrors!) who spend way too much of our disposable income on eating out and found ourselves tonight on upper Queen Anne in search of dinner. La luna looks inviting from the outside so we decided upscale Mexican food and a couple of Cadillac margaritas would do nicely. After being ignored for awhile, a man (judging from the other reviews on this site, the owner...) came over and asked us for our drink order and we happily replied " two margaritas". He then looked at us strangely and wandered off. We then spent the next twenty minutes waiting for him to return with the drinks. But to no avail...as we watched him walk back and forth by us, avoiding eye contact and waiting on other people. It then dawned on us that he had no intention of returning with drinks for us ( they weren't that busy and there were a number of empty tables around us ) just about the time a young waitress came over to apologize for him. Apparently we must not have made the "cut" and therefore deemed unworthy of service. Mind you, this was early enough in the evening that we would have been long gone before the singles would be heading out. The appalling treatment we received at this restaurant was enough to make me write my first review on Yelp. I only wish this owner could know just how much money walked out the door and over to another restaurant.
I finally made my maiden voyage to Tubs Subs and I must say, it lived up to the hype. &#160;My Caesar Chicken sub was super yummy! &#160;It must be the bread--it was crispy and fluffy at the same time. &#160;So good! &#160;I'm looking forward to trying other delicious sandwich concoctions from Tubs soon. &#160;My only criticism is that parking sucks, but hell...that's a small price to pay for sandwich bliss. I work a few blocks down the street from the Lake City Location... and live a few blocks away from the Lynnwood Location. I LOVE Tubs Subs A LOT! It beats the pants off of any sandwich place this side of the Mississipi (but if you're ever in San Antonio, check out the Mad Hatter Cafe for the nearest thing I've seen in competition with Tub's flavor &amp; gourmet sandwich prowess)If I could afford it, I would eat at Tubs every day of the week, and never have to repeat a sandwich during the month.The only thing I think they should change is to add a punch card system so that their loyal repeat customers (ie: me) could get a free sandwich every now &amp; again... also, run two lines during the lunchtime rush with one designated for pickups. If there is one thing I loath, it is waiting in line behind someone who wants to order 20 sandwiches to go &amp; still needs to figure out which ones while my sandwich goes cold waiting to be eaten.I recommend calling ahead to order your sandwich, to decrease your wait time during a short lunch. I have an appointment with Tubs every Sunday for lunch. I swear their sandwiches cure hang-overs. They are that good. Tubs subs- the Lake City gem. Lip smackin good. Beats subway and quiznos anyday. Creative selections. Lots of flavor. Over 30 different kinds to choose from. Also, fresh salads &amp; soups to pair with. Go &amp; be satisfied. All hail the FIRECRACKER. &#160;This sub was so good I saw fireworks after eating it. &#160;It came with a little container of dipping sauce and after eating my Delicious sub I had left over that I plan on spreading on everything from my morning waffle to my evening meat and potatoes. &#160;Damn good. &#160;I might rethink the waffle soaked with the sauce in the morning but it is still &#160;coating my thankful taste buds as I type. &#160;Goodbye subway, quiznos... Helloooo Tubs. &#160;I will be forever yours (or until something better comes along but that's doubtful)! The Firecracker is amazing by itself, but it also comes with a warm &amp; spicy barbeque sauce to dip it in--and you will dip it. Never mind the extra calories. You will burn your taste buds off, love every minute you're eating the sandwich, and make it a regular part of your weekly diet.They close super early, though, so I never get to eat here anymore now that I work downtown. My stomach says hi.If you're in a hurry, be sure to call ahead: these sandwiches take time to create and there are often long lines/wait times. best sandwich shop in seattle.i recommend the "thyme for chicken" and the "funky chicken" but really, everything on the menu rocks. &#160;their ranch dressing is also amazing. &#160;i get it on the side and smother my sandwiches in it. "The California. Toasted. With a side of BBQ sauce."I'm going to rip off her review, because it's exactly what I was going to say. California, toasted with the BBQ sauce side for dipping. Hands down my favorite sandwich shop in town. Lots of great choices....The Amiga is a favorite.
Delivery! Nice! Perfect for those days you're too lazy to even get takeout. My family has been ordering Pagliacci since before they even opened. Now I know this pizza doesn't even compare to the stuff I've had on the East Coast, in Chicago or Italy, but for Seattle it's pretty darn good! Recently, it's been all about keeping it simple. My current favorite is light sauce, mozzarella, sausage and goat cheese although in the past we've been big fans of the Pesto Primo and AGOG. The seasonal specials are always awesome too (can't wait for the Salmon!). The crust manages to be slightly chewy on the inside but still crispy on the outside. I love the numerous sauces you can order. I'm really not a huge fan of red sauce (hence why I currently order light sauce) and I love that you can have a Pesto base! Or an olive oil base! No need for that red sauce ya know. If you're looking for an abundance of toppings, this may not be the place for you, but in my opinion they have the perfect amount... plus, the ingredients are quality which always helps. &#160;They manage to find fresh, non-anemic looking tomatoes all year round as toppings. &#160;Nice. &#160;Ordering has always been a breeze and delivery is usually pretty quick. From time to time they've messed up our order, but if you call back you almost always get something comped on your next order and a replacement pizza. Also, since we've been customers for so long we aren't charged for our order from time to time... a nice little thing they do once a year or so. Sub-par pizza at it's best...I'm not having an identity crisis, I'm having a good- pizza- in- Seattle crisis...
McDonald's, the mother of all fast foods. This McD's is right next to the Seattle Center, which may explain the relatively upbeat mood of the employees here. The manager is really nice here too, always smiling and happy and thus the customers (and I guess employees) feel obligated to do the same. When the line isn't too long, I like to zip thru the drive thru and get a gourmet ice cream cone or an egg mcmuffin during breakfast hours, or maybe chicken mcnuggets or a mcchicken sandwich, depending on what kind of specials they currently are promoting. I stopped getting their coffees and espressos because they're like sludge! In fairness, McD's are trying to put more healthy alternatives to their menu, and it shows. Plus, business is booming during the recession, because all the bums know that McD's is cheap :D
The felafel tasted ok, but was not crisp on the outside - maybe this is a feature of some nation whose food I am unfamiliar with, but it wasn't welcome. &#160;The beef shwarama was ok, but hardly memorable. &#160;Service was adequate, but only barely - I was alone in the dining room for most of my stay, and the sole staffer took my order quickly enough, brought out my food on time, but only checked on me once or twice. &#160;He was also playing music at an unpleasant volume. &#160;And even by the standards of hole in the wall middle eastern places, the dining room is not very nice. Awesome prices. Very friendly family owned-come for the food not the atmosphere. Fast takeout service. We had our sandwiches in less than 10 mins! Falafels and dolmah were superb. Ordered take-out last night after a worst-meal-ever experience at Jalisco (*shudder*)...stuffed grape leaves, chicken shwarma sandwich, and baklava for around $13---not bad! Also, the man taking orders was incredibly nice and the food was hot and waiting for us 10 minutes later! Everything was delicious and fresh. We will definitely be back! Out of a party of seven who happened upon the Grill Xpress not one was disappointed. On the contrary, everyone was exceedingly happy. The food and service were exceptional. We sampled everything from salads to standard gyros to the specials including moussaka and lamb kebabs and every dish was made of the freshest ingredients. The rabih and tabbouleh were delicious, the foul ("fool") medamas was made with tender garbanzo beans with the most pleasing lemony dressing, the humus was creamy with perfect blend of ingredients, the felafel gyros was very satisfying. The tzakziki was cool, tangy and just the right amount of fresh mint. Fresh mint tea and fresh lemonade were the perfect accompaniments. The waitress was beautiful, sweet and very efficient and the chef came out a couple of times to make sure everything was okay. The background music was very nice and there was a beautiful mural painted on the wall that was dreamy to look upon as one consumed this wonderful experienceEdit Remove
Been frequenting this place for 5 years and will continue to do so. &#160;Even if their food somehow magically became less than edible, I would come by to hang out with the owner and his wife. &#160;I'll never forget the time he showed me a picture of himself in a Speedo in the 60s. &#160;Never been able to look at him the same way again. &#160;I was sad to discover his sons were spoken for 'cause I was ready to be a part of their wonderful family. &#160;Love this place, love the food (zippy falafel, YES!) love to eat here whenever I crave some yummy Greek food.FYI: the food does take awhile to get to you because IT IS MADE FRESH. &#160;If you complain about it, the deliciousness is too good for your impatient taste buds. It pains me to give this place three stars. The food is always great. The sense of community is overwhelming. The people are nice. The problem? It's so slow it's friggin' painful. If you take kids bring toys...books...or your walking shoes. If you're hungry you'd better order a salad to take the edge off in the meantime (make sure you ask them to bring it before the meal).Great grilled meats. Nice pastries. Too slow.
With out a doubt one of the better diner-style RE TA RANTs around! &#160;So called because the sign outside is missing the S and the U. &#160;Also loved the covered-up bullet hole gracing the window next to our booth! &#160;You can't fake that kind of atmosphere. &#160;Would you really want to?Down to the food: &#160;I got two eggs, rye toast, hash browns, and ground beef steak patty. &#160;The eggs were magnificent. &#160;The toast was very good. &#160;The patty was all right, but given the options they offer, I'd probably spring for something else next time. &#160;It was pretty much hamburger made into a patty. &#160;It was okay, but I probably should have gone with hot links as they got raves from just about everyone. &#160;In addition, they leave the carafe of coffee at your table, which is an old-school trend I would love to see come back in style.In conclusion, if you are in this area of Seattle and craving good, greasy spoon diner food from 7 AM - 4 PM, Silver Fork offers salvation. The food is still decent but I'm there almost every weekend for the atmosphere. Secretly I'm trying to become a regular...SF: Hey Naurry!Naurry: Mornin' SF!SF: Usual table?Naurry: Yup.SF: Your usual?Naurry: Yup.SF: Where's the crew?Naurry: Late, you know that.SF: Yup.One day Silver Fork, one day... This is a greasy spoon done right: the over-medium eggs are actually over-medium, the bacon is cooked to perfection, and the waffles are fantastic (just like sabrina b. said). &#160;Along with perfect breakfast food, they also play great soul music (better than the crap piped through Shari's speakers), have a staff that's genuinely happy to be there, and boast customers that laugh, chat, and make you want to be a regular.Along with the above, this place isn't too expensive and has strong coffee - a necessity on a weekend morning when the kitchen's dirty and I don't want to cook. For some reason when I hankered for diner style breakfast food, I had previously been driving down to Tommy's in Renton, or Randy's on Airport Way. &#160;Much closer, and equally delicious, the Silver Fork is an excellent solution to my breakfast hankerings. &#160;Completely unpretentious, filled with people having a good time. &#160;While we were there, a large boisterous group of about 20 people who appeared to have come straight from church were laughing and thoroughly enjoying themselves. &#160;I got hit on my a toddler, who tried to steal a kiss from me as I squeezed by his high chair.The menu is particularly delightful. &#160;I'm so word orientated that I am a complete sucker for adjectives. &#160;Why just have plain old breakfast food, when you can have JUICY porkchops and CREAMY gits (both of which were absolutely delightful). &#160;Also, I've never been to a restaurant before that brought me my own very own carafe of decaf. &#160;Bonus! &#160;And the scrambled eggs were some of the best I've ever had...moist and creamy, yet not one touch runny. &#160;How do they do that?Don't come here expecting gourmet concoctions or highfalutin ways. &#160;If you just want a simple and delicious breakfast, this is perfect. this place is amazing, but at the same time nothing special. &#160;If you want a good breakfast and don't wanna cook it yourself, Silver Fork is the place to go. I've only had breakfast here. My friend got the !!Soul Burger once. looked soulful (had a huge hotlink on top of the beef patty). &#160;Chocolate shake is said to be amazing. But the best part is the beverage selection. They offer a crap ton of canned soda like grape, orange, fruit punch, and all the other major high-fructose corn syrup sodas that are out there. &#160;You have to remember this place is like a dinner in st.Louis or something. Blues and Jazz plays constantly the waiters are more interested in talking than taking your order. But its worth it. And yes this is a greasy spoon. &#160;A bit short of being adequate for breakfast. &#160;Grimy feel to the place. &#160;We came here maybe three times, wanting to like the Silver Fork....but it just didn't work out.And with Susan's biting the dust over in Seward Park, that pretty much leaves just Geraldine's Counter in the area for breakfast. Want a greasy spoon, old style breakfast or lunch? Are you tired of visiting the 'hip' (read pretentious) spots around Seattle and listening to the pointless dribble that spews from the mouths of hipsters? If so to any, or all of these, check out the Silver Fork!I've eaten here twice now: once for lunch, when I got the soul burger, the one with the hot link included! This time I went for breakfast on a Sunday, and got eggs, bacon and a waffle. Food was great, atmosphere was great (some church stragglers, but I was in between services, I think, so not as busy), and they were even playing gospel music! The only thing I'd advise, to give the Silver Fork 1 more star to round out a perfect score would be the customer service/management. The waitresses/bussers/seating people were all doing a good job, but weren't doing their jobs real efficiently, like a well-oiled machine. (maybe that's just the german in me! =) ) I'm all for having a leisurely breakfast but the service here is glacial. Decades can go by before you even get a table here. On a typical Saturday a few weeks back we got in around 10. The place was busy but there were easily a half dozen tables open. Oddly there were close to a dozen people waiting for tables. There was a number machine with no numbers and no place for a list. After 10 minutes the guy behind the counter finally opened the maching and handed everyone a number...but still didn't seat anyone. Finally a waitress came over and said that the kitchen was backed up and it would be just another 10 minutes... The guy next to me turned to me and said; That's what she said 15 minutes ago...We went to Kawali Grill instead.When I have managed to get a table the foods been okay. Better than iHop but not by much. And even with a table and only a few tables on a weekday, the service can be slower than the turning of the seasons. A good place to get breakfast (with grits!) in the Rainier area. &#160;The people here are great. &#160;There is a huge mirror on the back wall with the Brooklyn bridge etched on it. &#160;They play good sixties-and-seventies soul music. &#160;What more do you need? I will definitely have to try the Silver Fork again as I had the ill fortune to be invited to go out to breakfast after I had already gone out to breakfast! I had to ordered the biscuits and brown gravy b/c I had never heard of brown gravy on biscuits only the pepper kind, so I was intrigued. The biscuits smelled amazing!!! I even said aloud, "Wow, I didn't know plain biscuits could smell so good!" The gravy was delish very salty and peppery and a lovely shade of brown. And get this 2 biscuits and gravy is $2!?!? My husband ordered the chicken fried steak with grits and scrambled eggs with cheese. I tried a bite of each. The grits were definitely prepared perfectly, no lumpiness. The waitstaff were friendly and attentive. Plus they give you your own coffee pot on your table so you can refill your coffee as needed. Smart! I am so going back to try that Pork Chop sandwich, wow! Similar menu as Denny's with a bit more southern flair. &#160;They play awesome music and the servers are friendly and full of soul. &#160;The food sits at about 3 stars but the culture and atmosphere knock it up to 4. &#160;One star lost because they need to renovate a bit.
I've been here once, and won't come here again. The only thing it's good for is to use up those coupons you found on http://restaurant.com. The food is below average. This district of the city used to be known for it's indian food... what happened UD???Skip it and go somewhere else.
I was about to swear off this place. When I was here a year ago on vacation, I begged my cousin to drive me here because of the DDD. I left unsatisfied and angry at Guy Fieri (as I am 9/10 times after going somewhere he recommends).On our way to a different restaurant, I point out Mike's Chili Parlor to my bf. Despite having heard the story of my first trip here, he still wanted to go so we made a u-turn and came in for what turned out to be too much food.+/- burger and fries+ bowl of chili with no beans, cheese and jalapeno+ spaghetti and chiliI was very glad we chased down the waitress to specify NO BEANS in the chili. Because if you know beans about chili, you know chili ain't got no beans.Till the next rainy night Mike. I don't really do dive establishments... but for some reason, I like this place. &#160;It's a dive. This is a 3 to &#160;3.5 star place for me. &#160;Good, worth eating at, and worth multiple visits.- cash only- tiny place- very friendly people- sports playing every time we've been there- Mike's burger is REALLY good, got a little special meaty sauce thing- I really like the fries, extra crispy, with tartar sauce- refills on your soda (coke)- very cheap - $5/burger, $1.50 to add fries to your orderI'm going back - and next time want to try the potato salad. &#160;I tried a bite of my man's chili... but I don't like chili in general, so I'm not a good judge of what's good or not. I am honest enough to admit that I am first and foremost not a fan of dive bars. Right off the bat, this place would not appeal to me. That aside, I also did not enjoy the chili... Beans and meat and a spicy red sauce. Meh. Not my kind of chili.I would have been more excited if there were different types of chili too. Vegetarian? White chili? Etc.Personally, I think I'm more a beans and cheese and brown sugar flavoring kind of girl. I really liked this DDD joint - It had a cool atmosphere, friendly waittress, drinks were strong and decent priced, cool crowd, good jukebox, nice flat screen TVs. That being said, the chili was alright. I think its prob best ON things, such as chili fries, dogs, etc. My dad's burger was pretty good, the fries are double fried and were amazing, and the hot dog was a hot dog - who could mess that up? But the chili was a little greasy, perhaps I shoulda tried it with beans to cut the grease, but over all, a very cool place, and if I lived nearby I'd prob stop in from time to time! Before you read my review, scan a few of the others. Go ahead, I'll wait....Hilarious, no? They swing radically from awesome to not-awesome! I find it amusing that most of the folks who hated it heard of it from THAT show. Also, people seem to have glaring misconceptions about what a dive bar is. Ick, the bathrooms were gross!! Oh no, the regulars are annoying!! IT'S A DIVE BAR, FOLKS!! You want gross bathrooms, you shoulda seen the Lake Union Pub...CHILI: admittedly not mind-blowing, just plain. Plain good, and the shredded onions are a fine garnishment. ATMOSPHERE: The owner actually converses with people, wait staff is friendly and no-nonsense, place plays some sports on the tv's, nice little deck outside for nice weather. Relaxed.ATTITUDE: Plenty. Smart-alecky, simple menu. There have certainly been better chili's in this world, but chili-like people-come in many guises, this one is just Mike's, SO DEAL. Mike's chili is a great dive bar! The small pasta chili is my favorite, with everything. I like spicy food and the jalapenos and onions are great, they are chopped so fine that they blend right in. Which is great, cause I hate large chunks of onions. My families recommendation is to get extra bread, that way you can soak up all the yummy-ness from the plate!The service is wonderful, the waitresses are great, they will chat with the regulars and be friendly to new people. The owner, Mike, is in the bar just about every time I've been there. It is really impressive to see an owner of a place that has been owned for multiple generations still there working. GROSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!1. The chili just is not good. &#160;You would think since they specialize in chili and have been around forever they would have mastered the craft by now. &#160;You can get a better chili in a can of Dinty Moore. &#160;Its basically a pile of hamburger soaking in grease with some onions on top.mmmmhm. &#160;2. They only take cash (its 2011 come on)3. &#160;I went to the restroom when we were finished eating. &#160;I walked in..I walked out. &#160;The health department should make a visit. It was NASTY. &#160;Ive been in nicer bathrooms in Guadalajara.If you want to read something gross check out their inspection results from the King County Public Health Restaurant Inspection Report (how are places like this still in business?) Some of the best chili you could ever have. Nice Solid dive bar. One word, underwhelming. Food selection is limited; chili was luke-warm, almost cold. Fries were good and the environment is perfect for a divey experience. Come here to drink and that's about it. After being attracted by the ginormous lit up sign, we made a spontaneous stop to Mike's Chili Parlor. It is a divey, no nonsense kind of place with friendly service. Among the 4 of us, we ordered the Big Ass Bowl of chili. Priced at $11, it was a reasonable choice for a midday snack. I appreciate that there is just one type of chili on the menu and that you can order toppings. Unfortunately, the chili did not satisfy. It was at least 75% beans and the beef was incredibly fine. Every bite was a mouthful of beans, which I did not like. I prefer a more balanced beans to meat ratio and like the beef to be in larger chunks. &#160;It was also a bit oily for my taste. If you are looking for a plain chili and love beans, then this is the place for you. I, on the other hand, will try making it at home....minus the excess beans. Okay, so my buddies and I ended up there after another place that we like was too crowded. &#160;Also, I'm a reluctant omnivore, so this probably wasn't the place for me. &#160;Our server was a nice guy, but the food was WRETCHED! &#160;I got the chili pasta and took one bite and almost hurled. &#160;My wife got the cheeseburger and it had chewy, overcooked, gray meat. &#160;The bun tasted like thin cardboard. &#160;I ended up eating fries with cheese on them because my meal was inedible. &#160;Pass the Tums, please. I've read a few of the poor reviews and sense these folks know chili cook-off chili from the '80's to current era. Mike's serves authentic 1900's to depression era chili - the real McCoy, that hardens into a brick in the refrigerator and can be cut with a knife and wrapped in waxed paper for the trip home. My grandmother cooked up a similar recipe at the El Rancho outside Denver during the '30s and '40s (I got to try it long after she had retired) You can cut this stuff like straight dope, with anything in the kitchen, water to thin it, pasta, fries, beans, toast, burgers, dogs and the flavor still comes through. &#160;Chili Johns in my home town of Burbank still makes this "real stuff" too. Now that that's out of the way, Mike's has ice cold beer, sassy wait staff, stocked liquor bar and an awesome burger, only improvement would be to get two tablespoons of chili on the Mike's Burger instead of one - with $#it this good, a little goes a long way. Three screens so you can catch the game while you drink up. Tyler Durdan would be welcome here. I was really excited to try Mike's after seeing them on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. But after trying them I was no longer excited. I had the chili pasta, I felt it was lacking. Not mention the puddle of grease at the bottom of the bowl. Not for me, but might be good if your drunk. OK so this place lives up to its Rep, It is a Dive Bar . With a Crusty old Man cooking behind the Bar. I'm not sure if he washes his Hands but who cares, It is what it is. If you want a Fancy Angus Burger, Expensive Wine this place is not for you. Stay Home! If you want a cheesy Dinner slathered with Chile that is sure to give you heartburn and Cold beer with plenty of friendly people that will Yell at the crisp clear TV during a sporting event then you have found a home. I went there because of the 3 D's too... &#160;The stuff had a smell like poop.. I bought enough for four people and took it back to some friends.. No one was impressed.. &#160;I will never eat there again.. Not worth it, not worth wasting my stomachs time enduring garbage like that.. Too many better choices in that area.. I would take a " Other coast" sandwich any day of the week.. Chili that makes you think someone took a crap in your take out bag isn't something anyone should look forward too.... &#160;No thanks. Everytime I come to Mike's I have a great experience. The chili and the rest of the food is great. The service is fast and friendly. They have cheap beer, they had Rolling Rock for $2 but now it's "Mike's Brew" and they have a patio. The only downside I can see is the bathrooms which aren't disgusting they just need to be updated but to some people that could add to the charm. WARNING: &#160;THIS &#160;IS &#160;NOT &#160;CINCINNATI &#160;CHILIThis is browned &amp; seasoned ground beef with a LOT of water.The place looks like it could be really cool from the outside. &#160;On the inside it has no character, it's dirty, and they only take cash. &#160;The service was incredibly slow. &#160;I will never go back!Pound for pound it's cheaper to just order Skyline chili on Cincy Favorites Online. dirty ugly and the food sucksgot sucked in by the diners dive show thingnot worth coming back too drove all the way from bellingham did some shopping in ballard and looked this place up felt the chilli trying to come back the whole drive back home Chili as it was ment to be! &#160;If you have never tried this place you must put it on your list of places to try. &#160;One caution, they only accept cash but there is an ATM if you forget. Ashley best damn bartender around chili isn't bad eithe Went there as a result of the Triple D recommendation and wasn't disappointed. I am not a huge chili fan, but enjoy it occasionally.The place really is a dive....a pool table sits in back and the booths are getting close to decrepit. That being said it was a fun little joint, the food was good and the place was true to itself. I had the chili-cheeseburger.I was there about 3:00 in the afternoon and it was pretty slow in there.I would go again............ Mike's is definitely the type of place that's not going to be concerned with its Yelp review. It's a total dive. The chili and beer is decent. I'd go back.
I've driven by this place plenty of times and finally one night I decide to check it out. Pizzeria Pulcinella has this saying "cosi si mangia la pizza a Napoli" - just like eating pizza in Naples :-) I've never been to Naples but everything about the pizza I had was very well crafted. The owner stopped by &amp; personally welcomed me to the place. The waiter I had was very knowledgeable about the various menu choices. I was recommended to try the Vera Pizza Napoletana #4 Forcella - Tomato, Mozzarella, Ham, Pepperoni, Pepperoncini YUM!! =P For Dessert I had Spumoni Ice cream to top it off! I grabbed this description from their menu- :-) The centerpiece of the pizzeria is the Valoriani wood fire oven from Italy - the oven design allows the pizza to be baked in about 90 seconds at a temp. of 800-900 degrees, which is a key element of authentic Neapolitan pizza. The consistency of "Pizza Napoletana" is tender and elastic allowing for easy cutting or folding. Expect a taste typical of freshly bakes bread with savory flavors of the San Marzano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and basil. Following tradition Italy, the pizzas are about 12" in diameter, will be served uncut for you to slice into bite size portions to be eaten with a fork or cut into larger slices to be folded and eaten by hand. Buon Appetito!! I will most definitely come back to this place with friends &amp; love ones :-) Sun-Thurs 4:30pm - 9pm Fri-Sat 4:30pm - 10pm Finally, a nice restaurant located in my neighborhood.It took me a year after its grand opening before I finally tried it. I was skeptical because of its location (fine wines in Renton? No siree!) and I really dislike Vince's (the italian chain restaurant opened by the same guy). Anyways, the place is great. Nice atmosphere and great people. I had the Lasagna alla Napoletana (top it off with some crushed red peppers and it is absolutely delicious. Surprisingly meaty.) , and a few slices of their Il Segreto di Pulcinella for dessert (which is a MUST! It's like a tiramisu pizza!) . What to avoid: Cream puffs. I'm not sure if there's a difference between French cream puffs and Italian cream puffs but it felt like there weren't enough eggs in the dough. It also tasted a bit stale. On the back of the menu in the dessert section, there's a coffee drink I've never seen/heard of before. Served in what looked like a shot glass, there were 2 layers --the top being the bitter espresso and the bottom being some sort of sugary syrup. Perhaps I should've mixed the 2 layers to make it easier to drink but no...i took it down with one swift gulp like a trooper. and it was disgusting. Let me repeat. It was disgusting. This could partially be my fault for drinking it incorrectly so if anyone out there have tried this drink and honestly enjoyed it, please contact me and show me how to drink the darn thing the right way. I said &#160;I wanted to go back for dinner and we did. At first it was strange because all the servers were different and so were the cooks but...nothing else was. The service was still fantastic, the food was amazing and this time we did have dessert!. The wine, the coffee, the ambiance...everything was fantastic. I only wish that I lived closer. Mille Grazie to Pulcinella's. I took my mom to this place mostly because I wanted to try it but also because when I was growing up, we lived a few blocks from the Rainier Beach Vince's. &#160;I thought it would be fun to show her the contrast between two very different styles of pizza.The place was pretty busy when we arrived but fortunately we were able to get a table in about 15 minutes. &#160;We started with the antipasto platter and each had our own pizzas. &#160;All in all, everything was very tasty. &#160;I've always been a fan of thin crust pies and this place didn't disappoint. &#160;When I come back, I'll probably ask if they could leave the pizza in for a few more seconds in the hopes of firming up the center of the crust a bit more. &#160;They cook the pies for 90 seconds, definitely long enough to cook but it leaves the center a bit droopy if you try to pick it up. &#160;I forgot to ask why they don't cut the pie unless you ask them to.I finished up with an order of spumoni, just like I would at Vince's. I stopped frequenting Tutta Bella to eat at this place. The atmosphere is more cozy and I prefer the way their sauce, topping combos, and dough turn out; they're more consistent. I've tried all of their pizzas at this point and honestly prefer them to some of the variety you get further north on Rainier Ave.Things to try if you make it in: 1) The dessert pizza. It is divine. 2) The cafe con panna
I'm such a spoiled little brat. Who spoils me? The convenience of the City of Seattle. You can find food till late in the night, unlike Redmond, which goes to sleep at 9. And then there's Pronto's - Delivers till 3 in the morning, no wonder our size 6 is the new 2. I'm sure you all remember the few snows that we got this year, where pretty much everyone is trapped inside for a few days. Well, I was anyways. Thanks to Pronto's, I had Pronto's for lunch, Pronto's for Dinner, and...well repeat for 3 days. That's right, Pronto's for 3 days straight. And yes, I'm the Queen of laziness.Is the food good? It's not gourmet, but it is the closest thing to gourmet I've gotten from delivery. And how can you not feel special when all your food is packaged neatly, and ridiculously good looking? Regardless of my list of special requests, Pronto's always manage to deliver exactly what I want. Love their wide selections of menu, pizza, pasta, sandwiches, and desserts. We never go without an order of the Italian or hot wings. My salads are always packed with ample dressing. I can't imagine anyone using a whole container of that dressing, let alone 3, it must be like soup! Price is a teeny tiny bit more than your usual deliveries. But you're ensured good food, and the pizza will not make your face drip oil at the end of the meal. Service is excellent, and accommodating. Fast delivery of fresh out of the oven food packaged with everything you need. And really, it opens till 3. What more do you want, greedy? This is my 2am food place. &#160;This is also my craving Italian and too tired to cook place. &#160;This is also the first place I call when I want delivery pizza with a little more love.I order here all the time and have never been disappointed. &#160;From the pizzas, calzones, pastas, and desserts, everything is great. &#160;Honestly, all the food is delicious and cheese covered. &#160;Everything comes fast and hot. &#160;His favorite is the pronto special pasta, tortellini and bacon. &#160;I really love their calzones.Even the prices aren't bad for the quality. &#160;And the delivery guys are friendly and quick. &#160;So I always tip well.Seriously, the best thing is that they are opened late and never skimp on service. Mmm. The place to order delivery pizza, sandwiches, dessert, and pasta (Magnolia - unsure of how far out they'll deliver). That's right. Pronto delivers pizza and pasta. Prices are a little steep than what you would normally expect to pay for delivery, but the quality is a step above the rest. Thank you Pronto for maintaining an updated menu on your website. I hate when delivery joints fail to offer a reference for customers to order from. Actually, I hate when any company offers a website with little else than a few images &amp; contact info.Great service despite being pulled in all directions. Not surprising considering Pronto delivers great quality delivery items that you would normally visit a sit-down restaurant for.I have yet to have an unfavorable meal delivered from Pronto. I love living in a place where you can get a menu with something other than pizza on it for delivery. &#160;That said the pizza here is the worst part, but take into account that I Do Not think that pizza is the world's most perfect food. &#160;Some interesting combos but the crust isn't that hot. &#160;The hot wings are delish and they have awesome steak fries which i recommend you cover in Johnny's Seasoning Salt the second they arrive! &#160;Oh I guess I should mention I've only had it delivered, but they deliver until 3am! &#160;The salads are all right as are the burgers, but the salmon fettucine is awesome!Had some issues when I first started ordering but they made up for it with free food next time. &#160;My only complaint is that the phone people don't speak English very well so NEVER forget to have them repeat the order for you.Plus they deliver CANNED COKE! Yeah!
Convenient take-out, fast service (and friendly too) - so helpful at the end of my work day. Portions are big and Julia and staff always do their best to accommodate custom requests. I just ask for my burrito "dry" (without the sauce and cheese on top) and it's just right. Salsa is tasty and they are generous with the chips. Worker's lunch special runs all day. Portions won't leave you wanting. muchas gracias! Gluten-Free Friendly. Julia and her staff have been so helpful in keeping me from getting sick and yet getting to enjoy all that Mexican Food has to offer. Once I told her I was Celiac she kept non-gluten tortilla on hand and has modified almost any menu item so I can enjoy. Sorry no mole :-(, but their working on it. It has always been on my bucket list to become regular at a restaurant. My cousin however beat me and this is where he chose. The owner and her sister opened the original Jalisco's closer to down town but then they broke apart and the nicer sister (in my opinion) relocated here. This place has the best carne asada period. No competition in years of looking for better. Sure this place is pretty ghetto but once inside you feel transported to a small sit down place on the outskirts of Mexico City. I have also tried their seafood enchiladas but I felt wrong ordering something other than the carne asada. Price-wise it the same as anywhere which is suspicious since it is a whole the wall. But I always feel that to get the best you have to find a place where maybe one of the staff of ten know english fluently and you don't feel completely safe leaving your car the parking lot even though you checked twice that you locked it. The sweet staff are always excited to see me and my cousin and they always throw in a few jalapenos for free. This is as good as it gets.
Four of us had a late breakfast today at The Fat Hen. &#160;Very pleasant, laid-back atmosphere. &#160;Great "pressed" coffee. &#160;Two unique breakfast sandwiches, one 4 egg scramble, and a potato soup with a pork and pepper sandwich. &#160;Overall, everything was very good, we all raved on about their homemade breads. &#160;Amazing strawberry jam seemed homemade as well. &#160;The cons...a bit pricey, moderate portions, and limited choices. &#160;Recommended for breaking out of your usual breakfast routine. What came first, the chicken or the egg? It doesn't matter to me, as long as we have the egg and Fat Hen keeps cooking them! The Fat Hen is a small little joint where both the food and interior are clean and well represented and everyone from the front of the house to the kitchen are friendly and attentive.If you hadn't already guessed, eggs are the star of their menu. This made it very difficult for my fianc&#233; and I to decide, so we concluded that we just return for another round next week! Dinning on a weekend, we had the choice of ordering their "weekend only" Benedict or Florentine but opted for the Contadino and Popeye.The Contandino is originally Salame Felino, Salame Italiano, House-Made Ricotta, Olive Schiacciate &amp; Chicken Liver Tartine but the Chicken Liver Tartine was unavailable (which made me sad) BUT substituted it with a yummy Bleu Cheese and House-Made Mustard (which I loved). &#160;The Popeye is a baked dish which they place Two Eggs over Creamed Spinach &amp; Provola - Yum! My favorite part was scrapping off the crispy edges of egg and smearing some of the creamed spinach over their home-made bread.We haven't had enough and will definitely be back for more!FYI: - Limited Seating- Florentine and Benedict served only on the Weekends- Daily Specials- Monday thru Friday: 7:30am - 2:30pm- Saturday and Sunday: 8:00am - 3:00pm- Street Parking...and if I am not mistaken, I think they may be starting a dinner service? The Fat Hen is run by a most gracious and hospitable husband-wife team. &#160;I savored a slice of frangipane pear tart with a delectable butter crust, made by Linnea, who gently folded a soft blanket of fresh whipped cream over it before presenting it to me. Never hesitating to enjoy dessert first, i followed the pear tart with Massimo's hearty zuppa di fagioli finished with olive oil and studded with creamy salt pork. It came with slices of the best baguette anywhere, ever. The crisp, thin crust and tender crumb were on a different planet to the typical tough, chewy French bread you usually find here. The care with which everything was made, the reasonable prices, the comfortable space, and Linnea and Massimo's charming personalities make this place an absolute winner. I can hardly wait to come back with friends soon. kid-friendly, cheerful, and clean. Like my Swedish grandmother's kitchen. And non-pretentious yet busily industrious with great food. There's the atmosphere.WHAT TO GET FIRST and FOREMOST:1. Home-made english muffins with butter. My friend and I nearly died of happiness. With coffee.2. The vanilla creme buns. Holy cow. What an eclair dreams to be some day.NEXT:1. the Kannelbular (spelling?!)2. The winter squash soup... with a salted olive oil and herbs HOLY COW (my aunt actually ordered it for breakfast and I will follow suit next time)3. Popeye eggs - as previously noted in another review, the yolks were just runny enough, but kept cooking in the ramekin full of egg, spinach and smoked mozarella.4. A slice of focacia with a side salad.5. Whatever else they offer you or can be seen behind glass...!Everything, yes everything, is house-made from scratch and simple-yet-delicious. What else would you expect from two of Paris' Cordon Bleu trained chefs who make their home in quiet Ballard with two delightful little boys?It's the early days of this restaurant, so I would just go with some $ to spend, a friend so you can try even more, and order whatever you see. I think the menu is still evolving (and is seasonal anyways), so go expecting a great surprise.This place is already popular, so if you go on a Saturday, don't be in a rush if you want to sit down. Everything was good here. You can't go wrong with a breakfast place that serves chicken liver pate, seriously. For drinks we had decent french press coffee &amp; milk + chocolate ganache, a far more superior blend of chocolate and milk. The eggs benedict was void of the usual eggs benedict sin in that the sauce was light but adequate. The fat hen scramble was good but nothing too shocking. All in all a very satisfying breakfast! It just goes to show, that if you use quality ingredients, success will follow. I stopped by the other day for a late breakfast. I had to try an oven baked egg dish. It was served on a bed of creamed spinach, topped with a little smoked mozzarella, and served with a homemade english muffin. You know what ? It was F/N delicious. I immediately had visions of a spinach eggs benedict dancing in my head! Tomorrow, my vision will become my New Year's Day breakfast. JR Great spot! &#160;Cozy and cool... they are kid friendly and have delicious food... baked eggs - yummm. &#160;The french press coffee is a nice touch and the staff is very friendly and attentive. &#160;So happy to have it in the neighborhood! Finally found a great cup of coffee.My mom and I had different egg plates and both were delicious (and came with english muffins), but the breafkast sandwich was the best.Roasted potatoes as well were fantastic and colorful, and the rolls with cream or Nutella on them are declious as well.If their breakfast is this good, I'm sad to find out they have the option to do take-out as my budget is about to shrink to make room for Fat Hen as much as possible. I've been to the Fat Hen a handful of times now, and each has been a delightful experience. &#160;The service is perfect: efficient and friendly. &#160;The owners usually come out for a quick chat if they have time, which makes you feel very welcome and comfortable. &#160;The decor is very warm and well lit with natural light from the large front windows. &#160;Each meal is carefully prepared, but still comes out remarkably fast! &#160;I don't know how they do it. &#160; &#160;And if that isn't enough, the food is exquisite. &#160;So far I have tried something different every time and I have yet to come across a meal I didn't thoroughly enjoy. &#160;The beef stew and eggs benedict are among my favorites. &#160;I've also noticed that their menu is constantly changing, so perhaps I can keep trying new dishes for quite a while! &#160; &#160;Do yourself a favor and try The Fat Hen. &#160;You won't regret it! I'm not usually a big Yelp review writer, but I just had my first experience with The Fat Hen and the food here was fantastic! &#160;We went for a late brunch on a Sunday and got a table right away. &#160;The atmosphere is great and both of our dishes were absolutely delicious. &#160;I'd never had baked eggs, but I'm definitely a convert now! &#160;The staff was friendly and since everything - from the whipped cream to the english muffins - is homemade, the menu is full of really quality items. &#160;I would definitely recommend this place to everyone and I'm looking forward to trying their dinner menu sometime soon as well. We had a very nice brunch at the Fat Hen. &#160;SO and I ordered coffees (nice thick french press), and shared the baked eggs with ham and baked eggs with spinach. &#160;Both were great - especially together. &#160;We also ordered an English muffin each, which we ate while waiting for the eggs. &#160;I wish someone had told us that the eggs come with a roll (or English muffin?) so we wouldn't have bothered to order extras. &#160;Oh well. &#160;Service was fine, but it is a little cramped in there - it's a small space and getting popular! &#160;We'll be back! No joke, 5 stars all the way. &#160;I loved everything. &#160;Just went for the first time yesterday. &#160;Lovely ambiance, decor, location, great light from large windows. &#160;The service was impeccable. &#160;Everything down to the orange juice tasted amazing. &#160;We shared a slice of the citrus tea cake, it was MOIST and had such great fresh citrus flavor, sweet but not too much so. &#160;Come to find out it's made with olive oil and no butter. &#160;Get out, would never have guessed, it was delicous. &#160;I had the baked eggs "in camicia". &#160;Oh my, wonderful tomato flavor with a perfectly baked egg. &#160;The homemade english muffin did not pale in comparison. &#160;Delightful, fresh, warm and soft inside, perfect crust out. &#160;My friends had the stew and gobbled it up raving the entire time and the other had baked eggs as well. &#160; You feel personally cooked for here, everything tasted so fresh and homemade. &#160;I am counting the days to go back! Top notch place. I wish I could hide it from everyone else and keep it all for myself.Came in early on Saturday morning. It was spitting rain and cold outside but warm and smelled nice inside. The eggs 'in camicia' were fantastic! One of those dishes that I will crave another day. The sweet french toasty thing was also great. You can tell they are using great ingredients and making everything from scratch.Service was friendly and attentive. Lots of french press coffee. Portions are satisfying but won't make you loosen your belt a notch after eating.When the bill came, it was totally reasonable right about $10 each for four of us and $5 for the half-pint. It hasn't taken long for this little cafe &#160;to become a favorite for many of us in Ballard, &#160;and why not? &#160;:-) &#160; &#160;The food, &#160;coffee and service are all terrific, &#160;and the room itself is what Hemingway would call a "clean, well lighted place." &#160;Egg dishes and pastries are marvels of simple yet delicious and satisfying vittles. &#160;I've tried to think of anything I'd change or hope would improve...and I came up with nothing. &#160;Looking forward to another Sunday breakfast very soon...keep up the good work and the high standards! Fat Hen has Hilliard's beer now! &#160;Also, if they have warm lentil salad when you stop in, definitely order it. &#160;I don't know if it's possible to call lentils 'sinful' but they are that good. &#160;I think there's pig in it somewhere. I love breakfast. Eggs, cheese, bread. It is all delicious. It was purely by accident that I ended up at The Fat Hen today with my girlfriend. Our mission was to visit the bakery across the street but they were closed on a Friday morning (ok so it is the day after Thanksgiving). However it was a good thing we ended up here. The service is fantastic and the food tastes great. It isn't often to have "baked" eggs as an option and it is an unique and interesting spin on breakfast. This restaurant doesn't try to push organic ingredients or fair trade, which while important, it just goes for the basics: good breakfast food. The prices are fair (we paid $8 per baked egg dish) and the servings are perfect, I don't feel like I need a mid day nap after leaving here. When we ordered our baked eggs, our hostess/waitress asked how we liked our egg yolks. Not only did she ask but when it came served to our table, it came exactly as we answered. But it has been only open for 4 weeks and with that comes some minor constructive criticism. It is great that we were offered a brioche and home made jam while we waited for the eggs. The home made jam was great, however it was accompanied with small pieces of butter that were almost impossible to cut into. Serve the butter softer and make it spreadable. There was a talk radio station in the kitchen/back. Recommendation is to turn it down or turn it to a station that is playing music (perhaps bring in a MP3 player and play tunes off of that). It is hard competing with a talking radio personality while having a conversation. Your drip coffee is from a french press, this is a *good* thing. You should brand yourself off of this more as it is unique offering for a small restaurant. So when I see small grinds in my coffee, at first I did the scooby doo look of "why is there a small amount grounds in my coffee" to only realize "oh wow, it is actually french pressed coffee in that pot... no wonder and that is awesome". make fun of it on your menu, advertise it. Do a little bit of passive aggressiveness Seattle inspired menu with something like "see the small grinds in your coffee - that's because it is french pressed and more awesome then the stuff you get else where".I think and hope that this place will become a hit and a destination breakfast (and lunch?) place for those in the area. I hope to comeback next time and I will definitely be ordering the brioche with homemade jam again while we wait for some baked eggs goodness. Food that is really good, simply delish, made from scratch with local, real, whole ingredients. So why did I not give them 5 stars? Coz they're still getting their act together when it comes to service... i will still be back soon for their amazing food &amp; hopefully they'll have ironed out then kinks by then ;)
Flames! Bananas Foster done to perfection. I took my sister here to introduce her to this wonderful dessert and was not let down. They wheeled the cart out table-side, set the pan afire, whipped up all the ingredients from little pre-measured containers ala Martha, and finally scooped out some of the most unhealthy bananas on the planet on to two scoops of ice cream and drizzled the whole thing with caramelized goodness. It took all the will power we had to not lick our plates in this nice restaurant...then we gave in and licked away! Bananas foster made tableside for two... oh sweet jesus and baby jesus. Got a girl with a sweet tooth? This dessert will get you some every time. Just don't eat here if you're a vegetarian. I don't want to really affect the reviews much, but this is a cautionary tale. The atmosphere is fun and my brother loved the huge meat plate. My risotto was ok. &#160;I ate some sides though- they were good. The wine was also nice. My ex took me here for my birthday in hopes of getting back together. Unfortunately for him I was in a major food coma by the end of the night. I vaguely remember getting filet mignon, and cheese and fruit for dessert, but everything before that is a haze. So, while it is amazing food and great ambiance, it will not help anything to happen afterwards! So maybe you don't want to spend $40-50 for a steak, or maybe you don't even like steak...that's no excuse for not checking out El Gaucho. &#160;In an attempt to hit as many of Seattle's best restaurants as possible, my dad and I had a lovely dinner at Etta's Seafood Restaurant, then per their recommendation (as we wanted to check out another locale), stopped by El Gaucho for their Bananas Foster flambe - what fun and what a perfect end to a night of fine dining! &#160;Megan D. was spot on about the "film noir" atmosphere - very cool, dark, and swanky. &#160;And, this place is open late to boot! the atmosphere is soo film noir &#160;i cant help but love it. the steak tar tar is amazing and i also highly suggest the tomateo salad and escargo. the wine selections are A+++ and of course the service is top noch. and by all mean check out the big picture down stairs for movie night!
This is a good place to grab a few drinks, and hang out. For some reason, it seems like there are a lot of places like this in downtown Seattle. I stopped by here after finishing up work on Friday, and after a few &#160;drinks of raspberry and vodka, the weekend had definitely started. I'm can't say too much about anything else, accept if you need a place to alter your state, this will do the trick. I'm updating this for any vegans reading the Cyclops reviews. Vegetarians and omnivores, go forth and enjoy. But fellow vegans, I advise you to not bother coming here if the veggie burger (Happy Hippie) is your goal (though the hummus plus pita is yum). In order to make the burger vegan you need to replace/remove the cheddar, the aioli, and the brioche bun. What are you left with? The patty and the caramelized onions, and the bread they will give you to replace the bun. That would be all good and well if you can expect that there is no miscommunication between the waitress (who completely seemed to understand I was ordering a vegan meal) and the kitchen, because what I received was the patty, onions, bread, and *cheddar* plus Parmesan cheese sprinkled all over the salad I substituted for fries. Well, I guess that's what happens when you make too many modifications to your order. And that's what's necessary here, so I'm not planning to try my luck here again. I hadn't been back to the Cyclops in years, probably since Washington got it's smoking ban, but that alone has made the experience more enjoyable. &#160;The Cyclops visually has a lot of character, and that makes for a fun experience. &#160;Granted we were there on a night it was totally dead and we could carry on a conversation, but for a Belltown joint I will give the Cyclops my recommendation. The only thing I have eaten here is a burger and fries. They are great at that. The service and prices are just fine. Location is good. I got my iced tea refilled sufficiently and generally like this place.BUT...I was there around 5ish because I work around that area. I have no idea what it is like after that. I had fun at this unique, friendly place. I wandered in here to get out of the rain and had a couple pints of their house IPA, which was pretty good. Sometime during my second drink, the bartender made lemon drops for everyone at the bar to celebrate the birthday of a regular. I got one despite being just some random drooler off the street. You gotta love places like this. "Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!" is what I thought as I surveyed my surroundings at the Cyclops Cafe &amp; Lounge. The decor is eclectic to say the least complete with a marlin, lava lamps, red chili pepper lights, Elvis art, and pretty much anything else you can imagine! I didn't try the food (in fact I was just drinking Rainer from a can) but the bartenders/servers were attentive enough. The vibe of the crowd on Monday night was decidedly hipster...seems like its probably a regular hipster haven, but I will be back just to see what new piece of "art" I can notice next time.Pros:Tons of random stuff to look atVitamin R2 TVs for sports viewingOutdoor seating if the weather permittingCons:Belltown parking
I'm baffled by the 3+ star reviews. &#160;This is a place I have no desire to go back to, and would disuade any friends from visiting.I ordered a $13 plate of chicken mole. &#160;Apparently "slow cooked" means overcooked, tough strips of chicken that look like they came from a bag of pre-sliced meat from Costco that had been thrown into mole sauce when ordered. &#160;The sauce was acceptable but the chicken didn't have any flavor. &#160;I had a $9 Cilantro Julep and their $10 house margarita. Both were overly sweet and and lacked interest. &#160;The cilantro julep sounds interesting, but use it as inspiration to collect the ingredients and make yourself at home. I prefer more authentic, laid back Mexican restaurants - not the types like Casa Patron, which make an attempt to create a more serene and fancy atmosphere. To me, this type of setting for a Mexican restaurant just doesn't go together well and I often find myself disappointed, as was the case with Casa Patron.I came here near the end of their happy hour with a few other people. Our server was friendly and quick, &#160;taking our drinks shortly after we sat down. They have an interesting list of margaritas which sound great, but I went for a simple happy hour draft at $3.25. As for the happy hour food, you won't really find anything worthwhile for less than $6. Looking at the prices I didn't really see the point in paying $8 for a happy hour quesadilla when I could just get a meal at the regular price for a couple dollars more.I ordered the Ceviche Patron, which was a mixture of their signature Ceviche's (shrimp, talapia, and octopus). The shrimp and talapia wasreally just tough and bland, and the octopus was no better than the rest. Everything just had a really overpowering lime taste and after awhile they begin to taste the same on your palate. Another person from my group got the $8 quesadilla (add an extra $1 if you want meat by the way) and it looked like something I could have easily whipped up at home. I didn't even ask him for a taste. In front of me a friend was served the happy hour nachos, which at first looked like a winner - until we realized that they barely put any tortilla chips beneath all the cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and other random toppings. He ended up having to dig for chips with a fork, and when it was all said and done he still had half a plate of toppings left behind.I can't picture myself coming back here to eat, especially not with their prices. The margaritas may be worth a shot, but go elsewhere for Mexican food. Very good. &#160;I live in Greenlake and there are about 8 Mexican restaurants in a 6 block radius, but after trying Casa Patron, I'm hooked. &#160;I've been twice now, and both times the food has been unique and gourmet-ish (Peruvian?) with lots of seafood and veggie options. &#160;My friend and I share an appetizer, a margarita, a pop and 2 full entrees - And the total (including 18% tip) came out to under $50. &#160;For Seattle, that ain't too shabby.Also - Parking is a cinch, they're across from an enormous Park n Ride that's always empty at night. There was nothing i found wrong or bad about this place to give it less than 5 star rating. The service was amazing, from the guy coming out of the restaurant to tell me i should wait for my friend inside as it's freezing outside to the amazing waitress we had.Food does NOT disappoint. It is not a regular mexican joint. There is a good variety to choose from, from some Peurto Rican dishes to Peruvian to Mexican to Colombian food.I had Bistee a la Criolla, which was delicious. My friend had a shrimp Burrito which apparently is the best he's ever had. The salsa and pico de gallo that they bring out before food is magnificent. I could not get enough of the pico de gallo, usually i'm not a big fan of it. Next time i'm stopping in for Happy Hour, they have Ceviche on their HH menu, Yummmm! OH boy so many great things to say about this place! YUMMY and super super friendly staff. The space was decorated in comfortable spanish style decor. We especially enjoyed eating upstairs. We went there Friday night and the food arrived surprisingly fast. I ordered the Camaronez y Arroz and my fiance ordered some type of enchiladas - BOTH were so well prepared and tasty. Great flavors and LOTS of food on your plate. You leave stuffed!From Yelp recommendations, I tried their Patron margarita and must say, it's the best I've had in a long time. Takes me back to Puerto Vallarta and living in San Diego. Mmmmmm! Their cheesecake was the perfect end to the meal. Creamy, caramel and vanilla heaven. On our way out, every wait staff we passed (we counted at least 5) stopped to say thank you and have a nice evening. The prices were very reasonable and we will definitely be back. We visited on a Tuesday night with http://restaurant.com coupon in hand and had a wonderful time.Their margaritas are strong (in a great way). I loved my combination plate; I chose tamale and enchilada (1 each) and it came with plenty of rice and beans. &#160;It perfectly fulfilled all my requirements (rice and beans, rice and beans! and Tamales! AND enchiladas! all my favs).We also shared an appetizer, Taquitos Patr&#243;n. &#160;It was wonderfully yummy and perhaps portioned to feed 4-6 people, but we finished it before the entrees came anyways :pThe decor is beautiful and rather unexpected for a Mexican restaurant. &#160;Given the two-story layout, we had the whole 2nd floor to ourselves while another 4-person group was on the first. &#160;It gave us plenty of privacy, ambiance, Their menu is also of great variety - I had a hard to figuring out what I wanted to eat (pork, seafood, beef, chicken, Colombian, Jamaican, Mexican, and all sorts of combination). &#160;Additionally, Portions are generous, parking is easy peasy, service was attentive. &#160;What's there not to love? &#160;Highly recommended. if this was more of a hole in the wall type atmosphere, i think i would be more impressed with the food. but its not so i expected more and i dont think it QUITE offers up the bang for its buck, so to speak. Casa Patron is a neighborhood favorite of ours. We eat here quite often and love the service. The owners know us and pretty much everyone who comes in by name. The service and the food are consistent. I know this because I tend to order the same thing each time with out disappointment. Domingo and his staff go above and beyond to make things perfect each time we visit. I had Brazilian Shrimp Frittata = potato, onion, parsley, cilantro, perfect amt of egg and shrimp.Arr-oz con Camoranes = Sauteed shrimp, cilantro, parsley, onion, peppers, mushrooms, served on rude and fried plantains. We are very pleased with Max and the crew here. friendly and very attentive. The menu is too varied to adequately describe. Heather and I went from front to back in the menu 4 times. and still took another 20 min to narrow down our choices to just 3. recommend. will be returning for more of the fabulous variety if choices.P.S. This review got buried in the unfinished box. Sry. I wrote it opening day, thought it was completed and posted. =( Good food and great atmosphere. Tortilla soup was one of the better ones I've had locally (I think there was a hint of clove in it). I had the Pollo Fricase...quite tasty and something I hadn't seen on the menu of a Mexican restaurant before. Waitress was very attentive. She brought me an extra bowl and spoon to help my husband eat the tortilla soup (he ordered a bowl and it as HUGE).You can park on the street or in the lot behind the building, for free. Garr! &#160;I always do it! &#160;I tell myself that I will take it easy on the chips and salsa and then I go right ahead and gorge myself before the entree comes. &#160;I think the service here was a little slow because our party of five went through three baskets of chips. &#160;They were fresh and delicious. &#160;The salsa was also good, just the right amount of heat for me! &#160;I ordered the carne asada and shrimp, which came with guacamole &amp; sour cream and rice &amp; beans. &#160;I didn't try the rice. &#160;Like I said, I was too full by the time the entree arrived. &#160;The shrimp was sauteed with mushrooms and garlic. Muy bueno! &#160;Service was great. &#160;My husband who doesn't like Mexican food loved this place. &#160;We'll be back. Two stars for this joint because I ate Mexican food in CA. If I was not exposed to real authentic flavor of greatness, I would have given them a three starts. So if you have not eaten real Mexican food this place might be A-OK. I find myself too early for a date so I decide to check out this new spot's happy hour values, but while I might too early for the date I find out that I am 20 minutes late for the happy hour. However, the waiter decides that it would not hurt to allow me to order from the HH menu. Nice gesture.I had vodka cran, meh. I had ceviche Patron, meh. Octopus was chewy, while tilapia tasted as if it was frozen and then marinated in lime juice, as if it should have been baked or sauted, and the entire dish was underseasoned. I did not think that you could underseason ceviche, but yes it is possible....I had shirimp ceviche, yum. Now shrimp was fresh and then ceviched so it was sweet, but still underseasoned. Service was great, so great that I have counted at least three different serves that came about seven different times to inquire about my food, drinks, or feelings. With all this service I was really pressed to find time to eat. Again there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. Two mehs, one yum. This is great Mexican food for Seattle! &#160;Not the typical everyday Azteca style burrito, rice and beans... Fried Plantains, chicken in coconut sauce, the list goes on. &#160;I have been to Casa Patron at least six times in the last couple months and have yet to get the same thing twice, and have yet to be dissapointed.Great food, good drinks, great service, good atmosphere. After getting no service at the place next door (Scarlet Tree) my wife and I decided to eat at Casa Patron. We had been here once previously with a party and we impressed with their food and service. This time served to reinforce this opinion. She ordered the chicken fajita taco salad and I had the beef fajita burrito. Both had peppers and onions that were cooked to perfection and were not buried under a thick layer of cheese. The meal was filling without making you feel like you had to go work out afterward. I would highly recommend trying this place out for a drink or dinner. What a great neighborhood restaurant and bar! Perfect for those days when a margarita is a must! Their taquitos are my favorite and the service is fast and friendly! I have never had a bad meal or drink here! Stop four on the pub crawl. Nice that they brought out chips and salsa for us sitting in the bar. My friend and I marvelled at the decor. The upstairs reminded us both of some place in Disneyland. Will be going here again to try out the food. Stopped by here at lunch with a coupon we got in the mail. Good selection, friendly service and quick! &#160;Everything we got was good. &#160;The portions were appropriate for lunch. And the ambiance was nice. Would be a fun place to go for happy hour.
Amazing. Every single thing.A group of 8 of us went for my birthday. We each chose one dish and then shared everything. They were moderate portions and each was better than the next. Great fusion food! The food here is mediocre at best (this is coming from a Vietnamese person).Portions are small for what you pay for. Nice setting, service is decent.I'd recommend Monsoon East! Food seems better and cheaper. Go for the Pho!Ok, I have to admit - I didn't go for the pho. Instead I had grilled pork rolls with noodles. Super filling and very tasty. However, my friend had a gigantic bowl of the oxtail pho - which &#160;he relished. We went for lunch on a rainy Saturday afternoon. The place is small and quaint. The service is quick and prices are ok - I think we spent $25 for both of us for lunch... &#160;They have typical vermicelli bowls, pho, rice paper rolls, etc. They also have a dim sum brunch on saturdays/sundays &#160;and a couple varieties of congee that I'd like to try.My only bone to pick is parking - there is no designated lot so you'll have to find a spot on the street, which can be tough. Monsoon has been on my try list for awhile. We recently moved into the neighborhood, and being within walking distance made it an easy choice for dinner last week. Our experience was much better than the first time we tried to have eat there. That last time we were met with a rude, condescending hostess and an obnoxious offer to "squeeze us in, but only if we stayed for less than an hour". Even as bad as that last experience was, I am glad I gave them a second chance. We arrived on a Monday night, happy to see that they were offering a 30% discount on bottles of wine. This of course brought the markup right around the normal average, but none the less, a discount for them. We started with butternut squash soup, prawns, cilantro. Very unexpected. A unique approach to these ingredients and a welcome change to the normal use of butternut squash. Next was crispy imperial rolls. These were a deconstructed version, with some assembly required. It was fun and each item was very well balanced. And my absolute to *die* for dish, morning glory stem salad. I'm drooling just thinking about it. This was bouncing with flavor from the pickled stems. I could see myself coming in during the week just for this salad. Another hit, with a shocking ingredient was the caramelized idaho catfish claypot. Now, I grew up in the south where we ate a lot of catfish. I do like it, but it's a cheap fish and not one I would typically expect here. This was a total home run. Well balanced, upfront flavor with perfectly cooked fish. We had this with a side of bokchoy. Overall, the experience was very good. The service was spot on and the meal was well paced. There was not one item that was a let down and were in agreement that this was one of the more unique dinners we have had in awhile. A very welcome culinary experience. The one thing I would note, is that this is a bit on the stuffy side. Seating, layout and service can be a tad cold. It is an expensive outing as well, but the end result matches the price point. The husband and I came to Monsoon for Seattle restaurant week. It had made my list of places to try, and I see it appear on suggested lists all the time. The dinner rush the previous night meant some substitutions. The staff was friendly and they were willing to work within my vegan preference. &#160;Unfortunately, they were unable to substitute anything for banana cake dessert (I'm allergic to banana). The prices are a little high. The food is good, but I think there are plenty of places with Asian fusion that are just as good and less pricey in the area. I will preface this by saying... i think it's stupid to pay a lot of money for asian/chinese food. but this is the only exception i have been able to find.I came here for dinner and was a bit skeptical, but the food was stellar! especially their clay pot dishes. The ambiance is fantastic, and they have a really fresh menu. Being chinese and having been to my share of chinese restaurants, i wish the portions were bigger... but the food itself is fantastic. Price is for the nice plates and decor. Having said that, the decor looks contemporary and chic, but chairs are uncomfortable. We went there for lunch, but the restaurant looked so cold and uneasy. Maybe, for dinner, with dim lights, the place might look nicer.Foods are not much better than inexpensive but authentic Vietnamese restaurants in ID. &#160;I like Vietnamese foods, but just reading their descriptions on the menu did not give me a good idea what kind of foods they were. Even after we got our orders on the table, we had no idea how to eat some of the stuff, Our waitress did not bother to explain to us.The waitress for our table was very pretty, but a kind of aloof. So here's the summary of my experience at Monsoon; cold atmosphere, uncomfortable chair, aloof waitress, and over-priced &#160;dishes for what they really are. I have been here two or three times.The menu is not extensive. It is simple. But the food is well made. I have tried a variety of dishes here. The last time I had was like pho or some type of noodles. It was super yummy and delicious!This is a slightly high end/pricey Asian fusion place. Restaurant is clean and ambiance is great. They do get busy. However, service has been great during my visits here. The last time it was especially good because my friend is a frequent diner here and knows one of the waiters. So she paid extra attention to us and made sure to check back on us frequently. Pretty good place. I sit in the bar area and get appetizers and drinks. The drinks are so unique, love them. I love the claypot clams. It is a bit pricey but the atmosphere is worth it. Based on just one dinner: &#160;We were in town on vacation and walked here from the Foxglove guesthouse. &#160;The hostess was a bit cold and uninviting, but our waiter was very helpful. &#160;I have food allergies and have to ask a million questions. &#160;He was patient, educated, and helpful. &#160;Service was a little slow, but the place was hopping on a Tuesday night, always a good sign.The vegetarian fresh rolls were delicious and I could have easily made a meal of them. &#160;Husband had the pan seared cod with morning glory stem and I had prawns with a yellow curry. &#160;Both were well prepared and presented, and had wonderful clean flavors. &#160;The morning glory stems were new to me, and I just loved them.The wine list was very unfamiliar to me, but the waiter was helpful.Not five stars only because I have other restaurants which, for me, are my favorites. I came here during restaurant week for lunch. I thought for $15 dollars the deal was quite good. The place was very chill and chic on the ambiance. The salad was better than I expected. The seafood vermicelli was authentic tasting. And the dessert banana cake was quite enjoyable. It looks like quite a few people come here for lunch. I would come again and try their regular menu. It is unreal how good the food here is. My sister and I sat up at the bar, which was great, and ordered the bo la lot, grilled squid, eggplant, and prawns. Everything they brought out was delicious. Our server was incredibly helpful - especially given that we both have celiac and have to be really careful about any soy sauce. It seems like stating the obvious, but this place gets 5 stars in my book - what a wonderful experience! We've been to Monsoon several times (some for Restaurant Week or Dine Around Seattle and some just normally). &#160;There are some really great items on their menu that we fall back on but have enjoyed trying some new ones as well. &#160;The regular winners are the pork spare ribs with hoisin and ginger, the claypot catfish and the banana bread with coconut sauce. &#160;You can't go wrong with these items. &#160;But others that we've enjoyed are the Bo La Lot and the salt and pepper crab (special on Sunday and Monday nights only), &#160;With the crab, you get a full 2 pound crab that is enough for my wife and I to share (we usually have a dessert or an appetizer with them). &#160;The service is consistently good and attentive. Love this place! The servers are ALWAYS great! They all have the same happy go lucky attitude and always have wonderful suggestions! I went there and was so happy and ready to order this crab special .... but they were out the last time I went. I must go back and order that again. I also had the pork chop that was the best pork chop I've ever had! EVER! I had the banana bread too .. and I didn't think I liked banana bread but that was sooo delicious! Check it out indeed! One of my favorite restaurants in Seattle. &#160;Monsoon is in a nice, quiet area of Capitol Hill. &#160;The restaurant has a small outdoor seating area, and then one fairly large dining room with open kitchen. &#160;It seems like it's consistently busy, but I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table. &#160;The staff is very nice and helpful, too.Now the food...The vegetarian fresh rolls as an appetizer are very tasty. &#160;And the peanut dipping sauce (something I think some restaurants have trouble with) is done just right. &#160;The crispy organic tofu is pretty good (made with peppers, mushrooms, lemongrass, and onions), but my favorite dish, is the Asian eggplant. &#160;It's SO good. &#160;The eggplant is cooked just right (pretty tender) and the coconut sauce is perfectly coconut-y and spicy. &#160;With a side of brown rice, the Asian eggplant and the sauce is awesome.I will definitely &#160;be going back here multiple times! Decent food fair however lacks hospitality Have eaten here twice, and at Monsoon East several times.On this Sunday night, five of us had dinner-- spouse, three teenagers (one a vegetarian), and me.SERVICE: &#160;5. &#160;Very busy with only 2 servers, but we never felt neglected. &#160;Our server was constantly moving, and provided us his full attention when with us. &#160;Also, (for first time at Monsoon) one of the dishes was below expectations--and our server had authority and confidence to propose and execute a satisfactory solution. &#160;His quick action prevented the overall rating from dropping one star. &#160;And he was rigidly professional despite some of the loud banter at our table.FOOD: 4.- Beet salad, imperial rolls, crispy veg rolls: &#160;all good.- Squid stuffed with duck: as always, 5 stars.- Salmon, wokked beef: very good.- Wokked lamb. &#160;3 star. &#160;Would have preferred it without the Natto. &#160;- Pork chop. &#160;1 star. &#160;This is the case referred to in "SERVICE" where the server quickly "made-it-right". &#160;The pork chop was thick and looked wonderful when it arrived. &#160;But, it was incredibly chewy with minimal actual meat as it was bursting with tough fat--and was also quite raw--the doneness resembled an ahi tuna steak. Our server offered a replacement, so I chose the wokked lamb because it was fast. &#160;In several visits to Monsoon and Monsoon East, this is my first negative experience. &#160;The greens with the pork chop were a nice, crisp, and very delicious.- Dessert - shared three. &#160;Coconut Creme Caramel: 4.5. &#160;Banana Cake: 4.0; included a nice slightly salty creme sauce. &#160;Chocolate / Peanut Butter Ganache: 3.0; beautiful presentation, but taste was not special--reminded me of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.AMBIANCE: 3.5. &#160;Have been here as a couple and (tonight) as a family, and enjoyed it both times. Had dinner tonight (Saturday) with a friend. We arrived at just after 6, so there were only two other diners in the restaurant. &#160;Despite my reservations made 2 weeks in advance and the empty restaurant, the host wanted to seat us right next to (14" away from?) &#160;the only two other diners. &#160;When we looked hesitant, she did offer us another more appealing choice. The food was wonderful -- I would rate it at 4 stars. We ordered the grilled asparagus and imperial roles as appetizers. The asparagus was great (nothing I couldn't have done myself, but sometimes it's good to not overdo a good thing); I loved the fresh basil served with the imperial rolls, though the rolls themselves were overly salty. &#160;We then had the prawns with curry sauce and the eggplant in spicy coconut sauce. &#160;Both were delicious - the eggplant amazingly so. &#160;It melted in my mouth, and was a perfect combination of spicy and sweet. &#160;The chocolate ganache was divine, though I could definitely do without the peanut sauce.Unfortunately the service was inattentive -- shockingly so. The waiter came by immediately to tell us about the special, did very little to try to establish rapport, and &#160;walked away without taking drink orders. &#160;I would guess that 15-20 minutes passed when he came to take our food order. We were never asked if we wanted a drink! &#160; After he took our food (appetizer) order, I had to stop him from walking away to ask for a glass of wine. &#160;(Sorry, but after a long hard day of work, if you can't ask me for my drink order within 5-10 minutes of me sitting down, you have a real uphill battle ahead.)The drinks and then the appetizers came promptly after ordering, but after we finished eating them, we sat there for way too long before we could catch his attention to get him to take our entree order. &#160;(At this point the restaurant was full.) &#160; The entree's again arrived promptly, but there was again a long delay before the dessert menu arrived, and after a long wait again, I had to watch him like a hawk to catch his eye to finally get the check. &#160;When we put in our credit cards and turned the portfolio so he would be able to see it (without being obnoxious about it) , he strolled by without even a glance.On the plus side on service, the servers and busboy did well -- conscientious and professional as they delivered, and very attentive to our water glasses.While perhaps the rest of the wait staff is better and there is hope, there are so many other highly rated restaurants to try that I don't expect that I'll be back soon, except for an occasional take-out splurge. &#160;I did love those entrees!! Love this place! &#160;Tried it for the first time and will be going back in the near future. &#160;The eggplant in coconut milk is amazing and the salmon was also well done. &#160;Great selection of wine and fabulous customer service. &#160;I can't wait to try other items on the menu. One of the very best brunches in town. &#160;The Dim Sum is extraordinary -- try the Daikon cake and the shu mai and everything else. &#160;There's also a "colonial" breakfast with eggs and wonderful sausage or other choices. &#160;Terrific. This place us outstanding every time we go. I don't get the bad reviews at all. You can't go wrong here, I promise. I &#160;have been dining at Monsoon on a regular basis for a few years now and while the food has been consistently great,it also keeps evolving. The reason for this post is a new pork chop which i had last night, that just blew me away. The purveyor (Tails and Trotters) is part of the reason but it was also cooked perfectly. I am telling you,you haven't had a chop like this anywhere else in Seattle. Check it out! (P.S. the pho is also spectacular!) Once again, I was impressed. Impeccable service, knowledgeable staff and delicious food. &#160;And to boot, it was restaurant week and they still had their act together. While I was there for restaurant week, I would be willing to pay for the normal priced menu too. Love. Just love. Amazing flavors and subtle twists (like asian pear &amp; mint in the fresh rolls) make this place really special. We oooh'd and aahh'd over the curry eggplant - its texture was so incredibly creamy (i know that sounds weird but it's a good thing). The ribs were surprisingly huge and didn't really "go" with most of our other plates but they were so dang tasty that I didn't care. The most unique dish at our table was the "bo la lot" and although I still don't know what it was, I know I liked it. There are so many options on their menu, all of them unique. Also loved the quiet street location and the simple, clean atmosphere and decor.
Best McDonald's I ever been to since the early 90's. &#160;I used to live in this area as a child and my mom would always take us here after a trip to Chinatown for groceries. &#160;We would usually have the dilemma of McD's or BK. &#160;It was always a toss up and so it didn't matter which one. &#160;I do remember this time, I asked my mom for a Whopper and she droved to this location in the drive-thru and asked for it. &#160;Long story short, we ended up with paying for nothing but got water. &#160;Anyways, this place is by far better than the rainier ave s location in Renton and the location on Graham street! &#160;If you don't believe me, order these few items and compare for yourself, The McChicken, The Cheeseburger, and of course the McNuggets! &#160;The McNuggets will blew your roof over! &#160;I can now truly say I have joined America's obese and diabetic with a smile now :) The customers in this McDonalds are very bad people. Unruly children, retards without helpers, the homeless, people wearing sideways hats, the mentally ill, and I'm pretty sure I saw a stray deer in there. But it is the closest McDonalds to where I live, which makes it like family. 5 stars.
I like this place, small but &#160;warm. However I wasn't blown away.Well, except for the souffl&#233; potato crisps, which is thinly sliced potato slow cooked in oil until it 'puff' up! &#160;It was good and interesting...but also expensive. $7.50 for a basket of probably 12 pieces. &#160;Everything else were a little boring or I should say expect-able?! Not that it's not good but honestly I was expecting a little more because Rover was awesome. &#160; Overall - Food was good and service was great. We went for a very dear friend's birthday on Fri night &amp; we ate A LOT! starting with a basket of souffle potato crisps and beef skewers to the seafood chowder of the day to burgers and the beef tongue sandwich special, followed by 2 desserts- the pear melba and the butterscotch creme brulee. all this between 4 people. we had a great evening...i personally loved the potato crisps, the chowder &amp; the butter scotch creme brulee. the beef tongue melted in our mouths &amp; the burger was great too but skillet is still top of the charts for me! When I first walked in the door I was annoyed. There was no visable check in area. As I worked my way through the crowd, I found the hostess hiding in the corner with a portable check in thingy. When I finally got her attention, she had no personality at all. I told her I had been trying to call Luc to change the number in my party . no one answered the phone. she told me " phone calls were not a priority of Luc". At this point, I almost walked out. STUPID STUPID thing to say. Suddenly a place at the bar opened up. We settled in. Drinks came on the slow train, but were worth the wait. The Lucatini was sensational. &#160;When we arrived at our table, our server helped change my feelings about this new place called "Luc". Our food also arrived on the slow train. Food was good, dessert was even better (butterscotch creme brulee....yum). &#160;The prices were fair too. I will be back. The menu was full of fun possabilities. My advice to Luc.......hire a new hostess! While the hostess has some learning to do regarding welcoming customers and finding a table using the snazzy ipad, I had a great dining experience. After being sat at the bar ( now a place I will request ) I was offered the menu and drink specials. If you can't choose between the drink specials, put yourself in bartender seth's capable hands. He can create a cocktail unlike anything I've had in a bar before. Points for unique drinks. Seth also recommended the sandwich of the day- pork belly with carmelized onions and tomato spread . It was fabulous. French food meet pacific northwest barbeque. Frites were crispy, And so flavorful. Bartenders told me that the chef preps them himself, and that they are double fried. Too full for dessert, but I will definitely return. Also- points for bartenders that have discovered the art of talking to patrons that are chatty, while leaving others alone. Too many times I've sat at bars and been ignored. People help make places spectacular, and the bar staff here was outstanding. Hurrah! Luc! I went here last Sunday, and I was pleasantly surprised. I wanted to go here before the restaurant becomes too famous and things get too crowded, and I must say, I think that I picked the perfect time. The atmosphere was very nice, and, the food. Absolutely delicious. I know that you might laugh inside at what I ordered, but I think that you can really judge a nice restaurant by their pizza. Truly. And, I have to say, the pizza was fantastic. Even though it's a French restaurant, they've got the whole Italian pizza thing down. My dinner companions ordered, pizza, a burger, and a meat dish, respectively, and the fries that came with the burger were absolutely divine. Additionally, for dessert, I ordered, plain vanilla ice cream (I know! Gasp!) and it tasted like it had been homemade on the spot. A highly recommended restaurant! Once they work all the kinks out, it's going to be a great destination to eat. But maybe, you should go now; because you might get lucky, and see Thierry himself behind the counter (as we were so lucky to watch), preparing your dishes himself. Like Rover's, this restaurant is all about sizzle and no steak. &#160;The owner is a master at PR but his food never equals the hype. &#160; The starters we had were quite nice, an arugula salad with bing cherries was tasty and the shallot dressing was delicious. My wife had the corn soup which was also quite &#160;tasty. &#160; The mains on the other hand were bland and tres disappointing. &#160;The beef bourguignon &#160;dish was small, and lacking the true French bistro spirit. &#160;It was a few pieces of overcooked beef and maybe 2 potatoes served with some toast in a bowl. &#160;I went with the linguine dish that sounded great on paper but was beyond mediocre. &#160;It had chantrelles, clams, bacon, corn, and spot prawns. &#160;How can you mess this up right? &#160;Not sure how but there was no flavor at all, just these ingredients thrown together with some store bought pasta. &#160;The couple next to me went out of their way to complain about this dish to us, I wasn't surprised. &#160;They were also nice enough to point out that they ordered the half order of pasta and yet they had 3 spot prawns while my full order came with only 2. &#160;Ooh that hurts. &#160;Anyway, this place was filled with folks going out for their every other month restaurant &#160;meal, tourists, etc., alot like the crowd at Rover's. &#160;The service was slow, the tables are too close together, and you will find yourself shouting over one another to have a conversation. &#160; &#160;If you want decent Parisian bistro chow stick with the Seattle stand by Le Pichet. Luc's rocking the wait list on a weeknight during their first month of business, nice! We waited for bar seats and a nice couple nearly grabbed two, saw we'd been waiting and politely turned them over to us. Cheers to humanity!We tried out &#160;a couple of their signature cocktails (Pega Sus for me) before moving to the Tempranillo rounds.The menu looks very inviting... we sampled the beef skewers with deviled egg, asparagus in lemony butter, frites and aioli. All were delicious. It's a Rover's junior, though some of the staff is quite green. No major oopsies, but it is clear that there is not an established process or intuitive service routine. Madison Valley is a hub of culinary options, so I think we'll try again after things have settled in a bit. Some of the main dishes looked tasty tasty! Luc was fabulous. &#160;The house wine was divine. &#160;The food was succulent and hot. &#160;The service was moderately good. &#160;It was very busy, but I would expect that the wait staff should be able to handle the crowds efficiently. &#160;However, I must rave about the food for now. &#160;I do hope it continues to be this great as I it is a neighborhood restaurant for me. Great prices, great location, killer pedigree. &#160;Overall experience was disappointing. &#160;Staff seemed distant, inattentive. &#160;Maybe as other reviewers (and my poor dining companion) keep saying, this place is still new &amp; just working out the kinks. &#160;Maybe I just had higher expectations. &#160;But for now, I can't recommend it, &amp; I'm not sure I'll be back. &#160;This sucks, since everything on the menu sounds sooo good! &#160;Burger was overly goopy/sloppy; steak frites not very flavorful... something was missing. &#160;Side of spinach was floating in cup of butter.p.s. Not a good place to celebrate a special occasion. &#160;Even if you state (twice) during reservation that you are celebrating BIRTHDAY, &amp; have a gift bag in plain view that says HAPPY BIRTHDAY on it, &amp; you order champagne to toast a BIRTHDAY :-(p.p.s. Why is there a TV in the bar? Luc is my favorite new french restaurant! &#160;Yum! &#160;We started with the smoked salmon tartine. &#160;The smoked salmon was mixed with capers and a creamy goat cheese and served on a crostini. &#160;The flavors melded very well and I could have eaten more! &#160;Then I had the steak onglet and frites. &#160;I usually go to Presse to eat that dish, but now I think I'll be going to LUC! &#160;The food, service and prices were all good. &#160;It was very crowded though so reservations are probably the better way to go. &#160;My friend and I were lucky enough to get the last 2 seats at the bar, so we did not end up waiting. Luc bills itself as a French-America caf&#233;. It occupies a large room with high ceilings. There's an open kitchen and a bar. There's also a seating space outside. It is the more down-to-earth sibling of Rover's, the august French restaurant next door.We were two for dinner on a Wednesday evening. The place was almost full. The tables are set close to one another and the large volume of the room amplifies the noise &#160;to almost unbearable levels. This is not the place for proposing - marriage or business deals - you won't be able to hear yourself speak. There is background music too but I wasn't able to identify anything in the general din.The menu is not long, but nice - ranging from hamburger and fries to more "French" items like trout amandine. The wine list is nicely put together.We shared a very good chicken liver mousse and then nice beet salads with good goat cheese. The trout amandine was large and drenched with slivered almonds, but the potatoes were scorched while their insides were mealy - quite an achievement. The Neah Bay Salmon was small but very good. We both had vanilla ice cream for desert which was very good. The glass of 2009 Washington Viognier was too cold.The service was generally good but our particular server made long pauses between actions.Overall a great concept with some very good food and decent service. The prices are very reasonable. If only there could be less noise. My husband and I tried Thierry Rautureau's new place this weekend and on the whole we liked it. &#160;The value is excellent for the menu. &#160;But the menu is somewhat predictable. &#160;More small plates would be welcome.The food was terrific. &#160;My husband had the pizza margarita and said the crust was very good, while I had the fantastic trout almondine. &#160;The butterscotch creme br&#251;l&#233;e was amazing - I nearly licked the dish.The ambience visually is nice, but the music is too loud and too much pop/dance. &#160;In fact, the restaurant is too loud period.Service was A+. &#160;Our server was prompt, charming, helpful, and had a lovely French accent. Verdict: &#160;If you want a quick, tasty, affordable meal before a movie - 4 stars. &#160;Date night &#160;- 3 stars. I don't normally write bad reviews and surprised that this has so many good ones. Yuck! The atmosphere and wait staff are good and I enjoyed my wine but the food was lacking flavor. There are far to many good places to eat in Seattle to ever go back to this one. Don't waste your time...I had their pasta ( and I can eat some pasta) couldn't eat more than few bites it felt like left overs from a bad dinner. My boyfriend had steak and fries and it was like a plate of salt...again folks don't waste your time on this place! My girlfriend and I went and ate at LUC on Tuesday night. We didn't have reservations, but we were seated quickly. I'm a huge fan of Thierry and was expecting greatness!I also knew that unlike Rovers, this was a more casual place, plus it just opened and everyone deserves a break in the beginning. In saying all that, we had a great experience, GREAT service too. We ate chicken liver mousse with rhubarb gelee, the fish of the day sandwich- (halibut), the peppercorn onglet steak, arugula salad and house made sausage. The steak was perfectly cooked, all the ingredients in the sandwich were spot on and I could have eaten three more orders of the mousse!At one time I knocked a ramekin on the floor which broke, what could have been a very awkward and embarrassing situation was quickly handled by another server who quickly took care of it all without disturbing other tables.A fabulous experience, I look forward to returning! Fellow Yelpers... I have officially found the BEST French Fry EVER! &#160;It is to be found here at Luc... Chef Thierry Rautureau's new and 2nd restaurant. &#160;Its a more affordable, casual version of Rover's. Had the Basket of Souffle Potato Crisps, Arugula Salad, Steak frites, Pork chops, Chocolate Caramel Cake and Luc's Ice Cream plus a house red.The food is classic friench and well prepared, desserts could be better but great homemade caramel, service was excellent... Our waiter Luciano was a pleasure, very attentive and warm. &#160;The decor is has a bistro/cuban feel... &#160;quite busy and caters to the Madison Park crowd. &#160;Definitely a great neighborhood restaurant and I can see myself coming here often for a quick bite. &#160;The 5 star rating goes to the Souffle Potato Crisps... There is nothing I love more than a good fry and this tops them ALL. &#160;These are up there with my double fried fries in Belgium. &#160;Potatoes are thinly sliced, blanced, stirred, chilled, then fried to order...The entire process takes 2 hours and Luc is one of the few restaurants that serve these anywhere in the world due to the labor intensive process. &#160; Once fried they puff up to create these pillow fries... completely hollow inside but im telling you, they are SOOOOO good. &#160;Perfectly crisp, its like a chip... its like a fry... I dunno, dont care... &#160;Just so good. &#160;They are perfectly seasoned and light. &#160;I personally like dipping them lightly in the aioli then in a bit of the sea salt. &#160;FRENCH FRY HEAVEN!!!! &#160;I would come here for the crisps along with the arugula salad and I'm one happy camper. I very much appreciate it when a chef puts in the extra effort to make something different and unique for his customers. &#160;Thanks Luc! My husband and I ate here last night, after watching the venue go through renovations over the last few months. The food and service was solid, it's in a nice setting, reasonably priced, and we felt we could take our young daughter - we saw several families there.The farro stew was great as was my steak. My husband reported the lamb sandwich was "good not great". I could make the butter lettuce with walnuts and balsamic salad at home. Rum rice pudding and choc cake desserts were fine. They have a reasonable wine list. My beer loving spouse was happy to see some good drafts available. The service is very professional although it seems the staff is still working out some kinks in getting food out in a timely fashion. They ran out of the Sun night special but we weren't told that until after we ordered. The wait between apps and main course was looong.To be fair Luc opened last Thursday. I bet in a month this will be all worked out. We definitely will be back. It feels like it will be a good neighborhood hang. Our initial impression was not that great. &#160;There was no host at the front door when we walked in, many open tables, and no indication of how seating worked. Knowing it was supposed to be more casual, &#160;we headed towards an open table to sit down. &#160;There was a gentleman standing by the front door who said the hostess will be with us, and to please wait. &#160;We waited a bit and several other groups lined up behind us.Once the hostess showed up, she said there would be a 40 minute wait but would not take our name until she talked to the rest of the people waiting. &#160;That seemed totally bizarre to me. &#160;How long does it take to write someones name down? &#160;So we stood there for a bit before she get back to us to take our name and cell number.We were called and were promptly seated when we returned.Looking at the menu, my beer snob boyfriend was a bit disappointed with the beer selection. &#160;For French restaurant he was hoping for at least a saison, a few of the tap beer selections were average beers at best. &#160; (please note that he is a HUGE snob and Brouwer's Cafe is about the only restaurant that would satisfy his beer snob needs) The wine list was well thought out, and had some interesting selections.So with all the bad said so far, why you ask did we give it 4 stars?We REALLY enjoyed sitting at the Kitchen Counter. &#160;If you are the indecisive sort and have problems deciding what you want to eat, this is the perfect spot for you. &#160;You have a prime view of the chefs preparing the meals, and can see many of the menu items being constructed with skill and care. &#160;While sitting there we were lucky to be presented with tastes of potato salad and soup from one of the cooks behind the counter. (hopefully we do not get anyone in trouble!!!) &#160;The asparagus soup was divine!For dinner I had the onglet with peppercorn sauce. &#160;The beef was cooked *perfectly* and fork tender. &#160;I felt the sauce could have a little bit more oomph, but you could have served tarter sauce with that steak and I still would have been happy. &#160;As for the french fries... I would say that they have fixed the soggy issue it sounds like previous reviewers had. &#160;Mine were hot, crispy and perfect! &#160;The aioli was great.My man ordered the couscous and was very pleased. &#160;I think he would have licked the plate if he didn't have the chefs watching.The waitstaff was warm, knowledgeable and able to answer questions we had about the menu.We both felt that this is a *great* value. &#160;We had 2 entrees with a glass of wine and a beer and the bill was around 40 bucks. &#160; The fabulous quality of food served for the price along with the great neighborhood atmosphere make this a no brainer &#160;as a great place for a weeknight dinner or date night.This has moved up to one of our first choices for those nights we are too tired to cook and want a nice meal.All in all, we love this place. &#160;We would like to see another vegetarian option or two on the menu, a better organized host staff and an improved beer list. &#160; We will be back with friends! I had a good experience at Rover's recently, so I was very excited to check out Luc's. We were ignored by the hostess and the waiter was no better. The cheeseburger was the only redeeming part of the night. The other food at the table was inconsisent. We did go during the second week of opening, so maybe they're still working out the kinks. But there's ton's of options out there. Delicious food, great prices and ambiance.....definitely a place to visit more than once!LUC is an unpretentious French-American restaurant serving delicious food at great prices. I ordered the whole trout as my main dish and the portion size was just about right and the trout was perfectly cooked and seasoned with a lemon base sauce that wasn't overpowering and made the other ingredients blend very well. The trout was topped with almonds which was a very creative and delicious touch. I will definitely order this dish again! For dessert we ordered the three cheese plate and were pleasantly satisfied as well. Their wine selection looked good, however my date commented that the wine he ordered was young with strong tannin, hence my 4 start rating. Service was good, although we sat at the bar and service at the bar tends to always be good. The restaurant is not very big which tends to get full quiet easily, so if you prefer to dine at a table allow for extra time to wait for one. Overall I highly recommend this restaurant and will visit again soon. Thierry Rautureau made an appearance at Luc tonight, my first time there. &#160;I've been to Rover's and had fabulous food there, the check at the end of the meal being the only thing that's hard to swallow. &#160;Fortunately, there's now Luc.Luc offers a variety of French fare, including sandwiches, salads and entrees, as well as dishes meant for sharing (large quantities and large prices). &#160;I had the grilled beef onglet steak with peppercorn sauce and fries. &#160;The service was good, prompt and informative, the fries were great and the beef was fantastic. &#160;Dessert was the only let-down for me. &#160;I ordered the chocolate and caramel cake. &#160;The caramel sauce was delicious and the whipped cream light and heavenly, but neither made up for the overly tough texture of the cake. &#160;The chocolate was obviously high quality but the cake was dense, dry and lacking in flavor. &#160;It was a serious effort just to get a fork through it.Being the avid dessert fan that I am, I subsequently ordered the butterscotch creme brulee, which was delicious, had a nice smooth texture and perfectly caramelized sugar topping.My one complaint of the restaurant as a whole is that it is insanely noisy. &#160;I went there on a Tuesday night at 8:30 pm and it was deafening. &#160;I asked to be seated in the quietest location possible, which ironically was at the bar facing the kitchen. &#160;This turned out to be a treat - watching the chefs prepare and plate the meals helped inform my decision on the entree I chose, and revealed a well-run team that put careful attention into each dish that left their hands. &#160;I even got a glimpse of Thierry as he came by to check on things.I'd definitely go back - there are plenty of tempting menu items to explore - I just wouldn't opt for the chocolate cake for dessert. Food was fantastic and the adorable and friendly chef stopped by our table (everyones table). The biggest and definitely negative part of what would have been a perfect evening was the acoustics. When we got there at the height of dinner on Friday (8:30ish) it was sooo loud we could not hear our waitress tells us the nights specials which meant I couldn't hear my dinner companion. They've only been open 3 months so maybe they still will address this evening spoiler. Was looking for a place to celebrate with friends my wife's birthday, we landed on Luc based on reading a write up in Seattle Magazine and based our previous excellent trip to Rovers. &#160;Booking a table for 14 was simple and easy, person that took the reservation was very friendly and I received a confirmation call the day of. We arrived at four with diners already waiting outside on a Sunday. &#160;Table was ready and situated right up front next to the front windows. First impression was very positive, simple but elegant d&#233;cor, unpretentious &#160;and makes you feel comfortable right away. &#160; Our server was "Luciano", very gracious and welcomed our group and took our drink orders, mostly wine and beer. Good wine list and options. &#160;I then asked Luciano to make a selection of appetizers for the table which arrived shortly thereafter. Crostini &#160;with Smoked salmon tartine, goat cheese and capers was excellent. Crostini was crisped perfectly. &#160;The grilled beef skewers with deviled egg was ok, the beef needed a bit more seasoning in my opinion. &#160;The pickled mackerel, potato-onion salad with egg, olive and mustard was nice. &#160;The group favorite was the "Potato Pillows" or Souffl&#233;' potato crisps, perfectly cooked, light and crisp. Very addicting. &#160;We had additional rounds of drinks, &#160;I personally was happy to see "Red Stripe" on the menu, odd for a "French Bistro" but perfect on a hot sunny Seattle Sunday. Main courses for our group included an excellent burger with caramelized onions, tomato jam and arugula w/crispy fries. &#160;Boeuf bourguignon which was quoted by the diner that ordered as being as "good as he had in France". &#160;Pizza Margherita for the vegetarian of the group, which she loved, the Sandwich of the day was a tuna salad of sorts served on a crunch on the outside, soft on the inside baguette. My wife had the soup de jour, which was a cold cucumber soup with a tomato puree which she also loved, along with a side of the fries and dipping sauce. I was not the only one that ordered the beef onglet steak w/peppercorn sauce (see hanger steak). Now here is the thing, we all ate the steak so don't get me wrong it was decent. It had an odd aftertaste, not all that unpleasant just different, &#160;not sure if that was the sauce or what. I looked up the traditional French preparation of this steak and its described as "ropy, not-too-tender but not-too-tough texture and its strong, almost kidneyish flavor", which pretty much nailed it, and tells me it was served as it should be. &#160;I would probably not order that next time though. All in all the group consensus was very positive, a great place for a large or small group. The "chef in the hat" lived up again to our expectations. Service was EXCELLENT, thanks Luciano. We all appreciated the non-Rover like price points and it makes sense for that area and diners being a bit more savvy on how to spend their hard earned dollars. We will be back we had a birthday dinner here with friends last night and we all really enjoyed our meal.first of all, the space is amazingly comfortable and inviting- the colors on the walls, the stain on the wood, the layout of the place. the smell coming from the kitchen made me instantly hungry. starving actually. we had a few things to share- potato gratain, chicken liver mousse, smoked salmon crostini. for entrees we had the fresh pasta, beef tongue sandwhich, shared the pot-au-fue. all amazing. something about the pot-au-fue was very comforting and recognizable even though i had never had the exact dish before. this place is wonderful. i loved it and i can't wait to go back. word to the wise: whatever the daily spec is, get it. i highly doubt you will regret it! enjoy. I came here the third day they were open. I had made reservations because it was a Saturday, but since it was new, I didn't expect it to be super crowded. Ahem. It was CRAZY! I'm not sure if this crowding will keep up or occur on weeknights, but it's probably best to make a reservation. You can make a reservation through their website or just look there to see what times are even available. (http://www.thechefintheh&#8230;)Our reservation landed us a table up front which was slightly annoying because it's pretty crowded as people come in. People kept leaning on the back of my chair which would shake me as I was sitting there trying to eat. It was also really really loud! There were only three of us in my party, and we had a corner booth table, but it was really hard to talk and hear each other. I like that they have different daily specials that all look awesome! It makes me want to come back every night of the week. We all had the soup of the day which was a chilled asparagus soup. It was delicious (although it was initially a little under salted). For the main courses, I had the special fish which was pretty good - moist and not fishy. My daddy had the pork chop which was really tender and flavorful. Hubby had the burger which looked absolutely fabulous. His fries tho... not crispy enough! Prices were extremely reasonable for what we had. If I ate burgers, I would totes go hear for a weeknight delicious burger for $11.50. There was decent service, especially because it was so crowded and only the third night. We had this weird 15 minutes where the air condition kicked into high gear and it was FREEZING! When I complained the waiter said that it would be fixed eventually.. so I don't know exactly what happened. I guess just a new restaurant kink to work out.I'm hoping to bump this place up to a four, but I want to head back a few times to see how the service and food quality (and ability to make reservations) continues.The chef in the hat was wandering around talking to the patrons. We thought he was going to stop at our table, and we were super excited, but then our waiter came and started to talk to us, so we were skipped by mr "chapeau." sadness, but maybe next time ? :) Best burger I've had in a damn long time. And how am I just learning about the existence of "tomato jam"?! I didn't even know you could jamify a tomato, but when you put that sh*t in a burger it goes all the way to eleven.Also, I applaud them for making the portion just right rather than using crap beef and doubling the size. The bun was good, the fries were good, the burger was HELLA good.Our waiter was a bit ditzy, but it had just opened so he was probably still getting the hang of things. Luc had it's private opening party this weekend. It's half a block from La Cote Creperie so it's easy to find. The grand opening is this Thursday, May 6th. Thierry Rautureau of Rover's fame is the owner. But unlike Rovers you won't have to drop $100 to enjoy a meal. The menu is American and French. Great addition to Madison Valley. I really wanted to like Luc, because I love Rover's, but it was a disappointment. &#160;We were hoping to sit outside, but weren't offered the option, although there appeared to be many tables available out there. &#160;The service was slooow. &#160;We were there for over 2 hours, and often spent fairly long periods of time with empty, dirty plates in front of us. &#160;The high ceilings make the room pretty loud, especially as the restaurant filled up. The food was ok, but not great, especially at these prices (cheaper than Rovers, but certainly not cheap)! &#160;The Dungeness crab for two was ok, but not a lot going on flavor-wise. &#160;It came with 2 sauces, an aioli (bland, just tasted like mayo) and an arugula pesto (unbearably bitter) and lemony-buttery potatoes (the most flavorful part of the dish). &#160;I'll be sticking with my favorite salt-and-pepper Dungeness crab at Flying Fish from now on. &#160;The desserts were mixed: butterscotch creme brule was excellent, while strawberry shortcake was dense and mediocre. &#160;The wine list is diverse and reasonably priced, with nice selections by the glass. Maybe we just didn't order the right dishes, but I don't think it's worth the outlay of cash to try again. &#160;I'd rather save up for Rover's. The food was good but that's all. &#160;We ordered salmon tartines, the trout and the boeuf bourguignon. &#160;I could probably eat 100 of those tartines though. &#160;Those were wonderful. &#160;Anyway, otherwise though nothing special. &#160;The ambiance and decor was pretty, but I'd say that was the best part. &#160;I mean the food was good but I feel like the boeuf bourguignon was just the Julia Child recipe. &#160;I kind of wished there was a twist. &#160;Or just something different, but nothing. &#160;The wait was atrocious so we ended up sitting at the bar for dinner and the service was horrible. &#160;I feel like the waiters only said hi to people they knew and everyone was quite pretentious,except for the nice hostess - she was sweet but seemed overwhelmed. &#160;I think they might think they are in New York, but I'm sorry even in New York people only get away with that if they actually have food that's to-die-for. &#160;And anyway, we're in Seattle people! &#160;I'd definitely wait for it to get slow before you go (because it will) and just stick with the appetizer then go somewhere else for dinner nearby. Because it's a brand spanking new restaurant, I'm more than willing to overlook the typical glitches regarding choreography. However, the food was marginal at best. I was frankly shocked how mediocre the limp French fries were with a tasteless aioli that added nothing but calories to the plate. The radicchio salad with thinly sliced apples drowned itself in despair with oil and was inedible. Advanced marketing hyped a casual, walk-in value system, something we didn't witness when our escort said, "we'll see what we can do," about getting us a table at 5 pm in a nearly empty space. I was surprised as we left to see the owner on site, hard at work to make sure all was in order. This left me the impression that Luc's fare is what it is and not something I would desire in the future. Oh and did I mention the poor acoustics? Luc joins the long list of restaurants making no effort to provide an aural-friendly space. Made my first stop at Luc on a somewhat quiet Sunday night. Sat at the bar &amp; shared the Duck sandwich and a beet, arugula and goat cheese salad. &#160;Both were delightful! The Duck sandwich had cherries on it, which added a nice zing. &#160;The sandwich was served with fries and a harissa aioli, which I had read about in other reviews. &#160;The fries weren't anything to write home about or write here about either. &#160;But, the service and the rest of the experience well made up for it. &#160;I live nearby and plan on visiting again in the future. Maybe next time I'll sit outside. I had an awesome dinner at Rovers last week and was really excited to try out Luc. &#160;Unfortunately, I just had one of the worst dining experiences ever in Seattle . &#160;The food was decent, but the poor service completely overshadowed the experience. &#160;We were not greeted by the hostess even though we had reservations. &#160;After talking to 2 parties in front of us in line, she turned around and completely ignored us. &#160;I had to chase her down and then she sat us. &#160;Our server was awkward and &#160;rude and didn't talk to us right away. &#160; He kept fussing with our silverware while we were eating, but failed to be timely in taking our order, bringing our drinks, or taking our payment. &#160;When asked about the difference between the 1/2 portion and the full portion of the pasta of the day, he mentioned the price difference and not about the size. &#160;I found that offensive as if that was the deciding factor on which one to order.When the food arrived the pasta was overcooked, mushy and stuck together into one solid mass on the bottom of the plate. &#160;We also had the fish of the day and it was very bland. &#160;I may go back for the delicious burger, but only for take-out. Thierry Rautureau you have done it again! Luc was one of the best dinners I have had for two people under $50! When I say best dinner I am not just referring to the main I am talking about the whole meal. Drinks and everything. The food had the feel and care of Rovers but a Red Robin price and that is something you cant complain about! The drinks were made beautifully not over barring with booze but a wonderful balance. The service was fast and very very responsive. And again the food was exceptional! I would rate this to be Seattle's best new thing and I am defiantly coming back! This time I REALLY wish there were a way to give 3.5 stars. Firstly, they open at 4 pm for dinner, which I love because we have quite a commute to get home and I like to eat early sometimes. I had a very nice arugula salad with Bing cherries (macerated in red wine), caramelized shallots and a Bing cherry vinaigrette with fleur de sel. For me, needed just a touch of black pepper (despite the spiciness of the arugula), but otherwise it was perfect. Next I had the white bean stew with bacon, and rosemary (it also had a few fronds of arugula and small dice of carrots and celery). I had a similar dish fairly recently at Thomas Keller's restaurant Ad Hoc in Napa Valley -- if Luc's white bean stew had included roasted garlic (Ad Hoc's had a few whole roasted cloves) it would have on par with Keller's dish (i.e. FIERCE). Without the garlic cloves, Luc's white bean stew is a solid 3.5 -- but it lacked the depth and richness of the other. My husband ordered the Margherita pizza. If you've seen my review of Oenotri in Napa, you'll know that they prepare among the best pizza (particularly the crust) I've ever had. The crust at Luc in much, much thinner (and Oenotri is already very thin) -- so thin that it's really a cracker crust and you don't get any real flavor from the dough. The tomato sauce at Luc was not quite as light and fresh as the tomato sauce at Oenotri. The fresh mozzarella on the Luc pizza, however, was much creamier than the same type of cheese at Oenotri. We shared fries (frites) with Harissa (a North African chili paste) aioli (and Gribiche -- a hard boiled egg white, shallot, caper, white wine vinegar and oil sauce -- kind of like a really rich, extra-special tartar sauce). The fries were great, as were both sauces. The Harissa aioli, in particular, was wonderful with it's spiciness from the Harissa and the garlic. Our server at Luc was very nice, attentive and knowledgeable. The wine by the glass list could be a bit better in the dry white wine category (which is what I typically like to start with in the warmer months). The bottle list is short but nice.
The Frankfurter that I went to is on the Waterfront on Alaskan Way. &#160;It is in a little hut type thing near Ivars.They have a full menu of all types of dogs, including your standard dog, spicy dog, italian sausage dog, cheddar filled dog, to name the ones I can remember. &#160;They have a kids menu with a skinless dog as to not freak your kids out.They offer fresh squeezed lemonade, chips and soft drinks.I had a sausage dog and junior had the kids meal. &#160;He scarfed his which was no small feat, as the dog was pretty big. &#160;My sausage dog was shortish, had nice flavor and had a rather tough skin. &#160;A nice touch was that on their condiment bar they offered many types of mustard and dill relish in addition to sweet relish and onions.Only drawback to me is that there is really no place to sit. &#160;We ended up sitting our grub on a cement block and stood to eat. &#160;If you're down by the waterfront and don't want Ivars, grab a dog from the Frankfurter.Party on. Just like "Dick's" but for hot dogs. The quality of their dogs are excellent and well-priced. As JC said, there is no seating but there's also none (at Dick's) - just take your food and go, which is really kind of the purpose of this place. I like the GIANT dog, which is huge and covered with mustard and chopped onions.. make sure to bring some gum afterwards ;)
Came here for happy hour with friends yesterday evening and I left pretty happy. I ordered the arugula salad and the mushroom pizza off the happy hour menu. The salad was delicious, but I didn't care much for the pizza (a bit too salty). I liked the lighting and intimate dining corners circled around the center bar area. Service was pretty good and the prices decent for HH.Please update your website, Mona's...the prices are lower online than on the actual menu! Happy hour...friendly chic staff...cheaper drinks and yummy food. &#160;It was empty(early) when my wife and I went to Mona's but it was very romantic. &#160;Thanks Mona's for a very nice evening.
I usually can be found here every now &amp; then if I'm in the Georgetown area.+Piping hot chinese food.+Fast &amp; Friendly customer service.+Plenty of seating.+Portions are huge.-Location.-Environment feels kind of blah -_--The food is not healthy at all.I'd still check them out. Red House is not everyone's cup of tea. &#160;It's blue collar, stick to your ribs, super-sized portions of "Americanized" Chinese food. &#160;That being said, it is a guilty pleasure to eat there occasionally. &#160;The best thing there are the egg rolls. &#160;They are huge, greasy and filled with pork and vegetables. &#160;The people who work there are always friendly and like I said the portions are well worth the reasonable price. &#160;Just know going in that this is not some fancy place with exotic flavors, but I always stop in when I'm driving through Georgetown.
Great vegetarian combination (also vegan) - good service - moderate prices. The only downside is that the room is heavily incensed and you definitely smell like incense and ethiopian food afterwards! Mediocre food &amp; service. Short staffed. Nice waitress. Inexpensive.
In the real world, Rosita's probably only deserves 4 stars.However, in Seattle, and more importantly, Greenlake, it gets 5 delicious stars.I heart their Veggie Chimichangas, their salsa, their house margs, their cold beer, their fresh dinner tortillas and their location. Plus I hear their fish tacos are purdy good.I used to have to trek up to Carkeek Park to go to Luisa's to get this food. Since Rosita's is a spin-off restaurant, I can walk over there to get it.Yes, there are tons of children there, but another margarita and they won't be bothering you. That's one more for you, not them. This is your standard, generic, Americanized Mexican restaurant. They serve meals consisting of beans, rice, meats, cheese, veggies, salsas y tortillas in all the standard combinations... or combinaciones. Your meal comes with chips and salsa that is tame enough for your average post-nuclear family.The walls of the restaurant are painted adobe yellow with images of cactus in the rich reds and greens found in a novelty sombrero, and pleather padded booths to match. This way the family can essentially be eating on a couch somewhere other than in their living room.On a Saturday evening, the restaurant is packed with two parent middle class families on their special night out. It is a family restaurant for a family neighborhood.The two things this restaurant has going for it, which set it a half step above Azteca are: 1. on weekend evenings, they have someone making hand-made corn tortillas for you to sample. In the scope of handmade tortillas, they are really nothing special, but they get points for at least making an effort.2. The service is Speedy Gonzales fast. I got up immediately after ordering to join a three party line at the tortilla-making station and my food was on the table by the time the person before me was ordering their tortillas.So, if you are looking for safe, Americanized Mexican food with no surprises, Rosita's is the place for you. This comfortable and relaxed restaurant in Greenlake serves better than your average Mexican food, with an excellent vegetarian menu. &#160;My favorites: The spicy green salsa that they serve with chips and the FRESH LIME MARGARITAS. &#160;They are completely worth the top-shelf price-- I can never have just one!A good place to bring kids-- it's fast, relaxed, and no one minds if they throw food on the floor. &#160;Plus the basket of chips right after you sit down helps keep everyone entertained from the get-go. Some of the best mexican food I have had in Seattle. The margaritas are excellent. The homemade tortilla bar is terrific and unique and a wonderful way to start your meal. My favorite dinners are the fajitas (split it with your sweetie!) or the chimichanga. Rosita's is typically very busy from 6 - 8 pm, even mid-week, and as such, can be pretty loud at times, but the great food and drinks will hook you in and keep you coming back. I think the last review was a little harsh. I really like this place. The food is good and it blows any Azteca/Puerto Vallarta chain out of the water. I have a penchant for fish tacos - they are delicious and oh so good when done right. Right after I graduated from college I spent a month wandering around Baja California and ate basically only fish tacos. I got really sick of them. But now not only do I find them great again, they also have sentimental value for me. &#160; Anyhow, Rosita's does fish tacos really, really well. The thing that sets them apart is their sauces. The fish taco plate comes with like three different sauces, all with a distinct, yummy flavor. My boyfriend had some kind of mole once when we went here, and that was great! The downside to this place is that it's always pretty busy, and most of the servers seem a little harried. There also seem to be a lot of children there. I don't hate children (that much), but it's a little bit ridiculous when the people at the table next to me are taking their toddler on "walks" around the restaurant because he's restless. He didn't even seem to be that restless. Sheesh, leave the kid alone. I guess it is a family-friendly atmosphere though.  &#160; The fish tacos will keep me coming back. Look for the coupon in your Val-Pack too! Rosita's signature item has to be their freshly made tortillas available for free just by walking up to the tortilla counter and asking for some! &#160;The chips and salsa are addictive, so watch out! &#160;The main entrees are pretty good as well; for Seattle Mexican food, they are especially good. &#160;Quick, reasonably priced and addictive chips and salsa - what's not to like? I had a pretty standard Mexican meal that I could have gotten pretty much anywhere in the country. &#160;The good news is that their menu is large with many things still to be tried. &#160;The interior design was blah and reminded me of Azteca. &#160;The most unique thing about the place was the woman rolling tortillas who would make you a freshly cooked tortilla rolled with butter and salsa - that was delicious! This is our fall back place for happy hour! &#160;It is family owned and operated and on any given night you'll even see the owner bussing tables.We eat here with friends for dinner, but their happy our is so good. &#160;Their fresh tortillas and salsa are always a treat. &#160;We love to eat out and we are all about cheat eats. &#160;Their salad dressing is sweet and tangy and they really do have the best nachos. &#160;I highly recommend this if you're in the mood for simple mexican. &#160;Another good thing..late night happy hour starts at 9pm! Proximity to Greenlake is a big plus, but the tortilla bar is my favorite part. Excellent happy hour. Fresh tortillas. Green salsa. Vegetarian Chimichangas. Mmm. The atmosphere here is good, as long as you don't get stuck by the door. The bar is really the best place to sit.For Greenlake, or anywhere in Seattle, this is great Mexican food. I go here a lot!
I had the fillet which was perfectly cooked. The side of veggies were tender and simply cooked. The company we kept enjoyed their burger, steak, and salmon equally. Service was good, our meals arrived quickly and cooked as ordered. I think most appealing about Jak's is that you get more than what you pay. $28 for a fillet, which comes with 2 sides and a salad is a fair and good price.Downsides: long wait (1-1.5 hrs when arriving at7pm on a Friday and the bar was packed/standing room only), takes no reservations, and the decor is about 20 years outdated and shoddy looking. It's steak. It's good. It's got good steak. We stumbled upon this place on our trip to Seattle. All we can say is how fortunate we were to eat at this restaurant without reading any review or even knowing this place ahead of the time. It was a weekday early evening and we waited for roughly 30 min. I had the NY strip and my gf had the sirloin. These are THE BEST steaks I've ever tasted. It's on the par of Donovan's at San Diego but less expansive. The staff is very knowledgeable. He explained detail on what each cut is. Just to think about it makes me want to go to Seattle again. Yup. It's that good. I love this place. Their happy hour is fabulous, if over-crowded already. The steak. aaaaaahhh... the steak. I've only ever eaten in the bar, but the full menu is available there, as are the occasional attractive males of the species.The steak sandwich is my favorite, it's a real steak on a hoagie, served like a french dip without all the silly stuff. That is to say, it's a steak, au jus. Period. End transmission. Fabulous.The hot chili prawns appetizer is to die for, the kind that makes you lose all composure while flirting with the bartender, the kind of losing your composure that makes you not so cute anymore. And you don't care, they're so good. There's a great steak salad thing too, and of course the steak-on-ceramic plate is always good. God bless the owners of Jak's for bringing really quality steak to the masses without piles of cash.
This is the first time I have tried this place. It really was accidental, as I was walking by yesterday with my mom and I noticed how busy this place was. We decided to take it to go because it was packed and they only had 2 people serving everyone, a waiter and a waitress. I decided on the Reuben sandwich and it was the best Reuben I have ever had. They make the pastrami fresh with sauerkraut and a tangy Russian dressing on Rye cooked too perfection, Yum! My mom had the California Dreaming and it had Turkey, Avocado Tomato and Swiss on Sour Dough. She loved it. The only complaint she had was that the crust on the bread was too thick , go figure, but she is not a big fan of bread, ( I wish I could say the same) The coleslaw and dill pickle sliver was also good. This place is one of our favorites; my husband has been coming here for years and when we met, it quickly became a place for us to go when we were tired and needed something different - something good - something cozy. &#160;The waiter knows us and I always feel welcome. &#160;One of my least favorite things about this place, however, are the hours. &#160;They are very irregular. &#160;Recently they added more hours. &#160;That was nice.For the past three weeks, I've asked to go to EATS. &#160;My husband finally gave in (he always wants Mexican) and we arrived at 7:50pm for dinner on a Friday night. &#160;The second we walked in, we were greeted by "The kitchen is CLOSED!". &#160;Um....it was 7:50pm and they close at 8:30pm. &#160;If I was a restaurant - a business - wanting to do business - I might close my kitchen at closing time. &#160;That would make sense.I seriously doubt we will ever go back. &#160;My husband was livid - and hungry! &#160;I was making all kinds of excuses to calm him down - yet, I agree. &#160;It was BS. &#160;Sad. Nice and pleasant staff, but the food was surprisingly bad. Two of us for lunch, and almost everything a disappointment: the supposedly award-winning chicken soup w/ matzo was surprisingly watery and utterly tasteless. It came with a few slices of bread, but, as far as I could tell, I was given one piece of bread and a couple pieces of random bread crust. The egg salad sandwich was equally bland, and the fact that my husband salted his tuna salad sandwich three different times during the course of our meal was a clear indication of how little flavor it had as well. The cole slaw was the best part, but even that was overly sweet. This was my first visit - maybe we just ordered all the wrong things? I have gone to Eats a couple of times and this last time I found the BEST black bean veggie burger I have ever had! &#160;It was so moist and flavorful, just divine! &#160;Get it with blue cheese and it will be even tastier!!! &#160;I'm not sure why people are complaining about them not serving fries with their burgers.. Their coleslaw was delicious and who doesn't love a pickle! &#160;This place is also great for kiddos, I brought my 5 year old and she loved it. &#160;They have great choices on their kids menu and obviously the chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich was a big hit with her!! &#160;She even asked if we could eat dinner there again the next evening! &#160;The service was great! &#160;The waitress was very attentive and friendly.. &#160;We will definitely be back to this place! Awesome tuna melt w/ crispy bacon... Mmmm! Weird... Tonight my partner and I wanted burgers for dinner, but being vegetarian, I was dying for a really good black bean burger. &#160;Found it. &#160;They will make any of their burgers with the veggie burger and serve it with cole slaw which was good and homemade or chips. &#160;I'm not personally a chips fan. &#160;And I didn't really need a pile of greasy fries to make me feel like I was having a burger. &#160;Both our meals were great AND we brilliantly opted for desert and shared the molten chocolate cake with homemade vanilla bean ice cream. &#160;All I have to say is, great choice! &#160;All in all a bit spendy, but exactly what we wanted and left us planning to return as we live in the area. Our server was friendly and prompt. &#160;Slightly random, but we liked him. &#160;Basically, for a last second decision on a mellow Friday night, this place did us right. &#160;So I would say try it and decide for yourself. &#160;I'm glad I didn't read all these reviews first. I've been here a couple times and have always been impressed. &#160;Today I came in for breakfast and was super impressed with their biscuits! &#160;I orderd the breakfast sliders and was in biscuit heaven. &#160;It consisted of 2 biscuits decked out with scrambled eggs, cheddar and bacon and a side of home fries. &#160;The coffee was very good and the waitress was very friendly. &#160;The prices were decent but my only issue was the children's menu was a bit pricey and was missing some basic favorites. &#160;I will be back! The service has been outstanding every time I've been here. They're always friendly &amp; they recognize you after a few visits. I'd recommend the biscuits &amp; gravy, as well as the club sandwich, both have been delicious each time I've had them.
The Great Cookie QuestLiving and working in Greenlake, it was a very common sight to see me moseying down the drive to the Urban Bakery in search of a sugar fix. Walking into the neighborhood cafe, I was always greeted with a friendly face and an eyeful of delicious looking baked goods. Not once did I ever try the bread puddings or the glossy fruit tarts...it was a big cookie I was after. Sugar? Peanut Butter? Chocolate Chip? M&amp;M? Oatmeal &amp; Raisin? Too many choices! Every week I would stand there and stare at the display case -trying to convince myself to choose just one. Every week I would "happen" to forget cash and have to put a $5 minimum on my debit card. "I'll take one of each! I'll share with the office!" Yes, I would share with the office, after I cut off half of each to enjoy myself. (The cookies are very big.) Biting into to the "crisp on the outside/chewy and soft on the inside" deliciousness that was the Urban Bakery cookie was like biting into a little bit of heaven.After a couple of years, Urban Bakery was bought out by another family. Gone was my favorite cashier, and flat and crunchy went my cookies. After a few tries, I finally realized that the bakery wasn't just having a bad day...the cookies I came to love were gone.For the rest of the story, visit http://TaraEatsSeattle.b&#8230;
Any chance I get to eat with my hands and have it be socially acceptable, I'm down. &#160;Regardless, I still managed to eat like a total slob, spilling meat and mashed lentils(at least that's what I think they were) all over myself and the table in the general vicinity of my mouth, but you'll hear no apologies from this guy. &#160;I had a smile on my face all the while.I loved every bite. &#160;I actually found myself day dreaming about it today, wishing I had just one more bite of that delicious Talapia seasoned to perfection. &#160;Also, I love places where the food is served on one platter for you and your dinner companion to share. &#160; It makes me feel like we both had an equal hand in eating the food before us, even though we both know I had more than my fair share of the food. &#160;Oh well, out of sight, out of mind.That being said, I love this place, and it won't be too soon that I am back stuffing my crepe with small piles of undetermined mashed substances. YUM!I live in the CD, home to many walkable Ethiopian eateries...Why go to Cap Hill? &#160;Well, this one is way up there in taste, service, and portions. &#160;The veg platter here is good; I recommend extra greens ($2) so you don't have to fight over them.Man...this cuisine can be so unkind later in the night that I am not sure I'd make it a date destination. &#160;Your mileage may vary, and it *is* worth it. Once, I was a sheltered young suburbanite whose idea of "ethnic food" was Americanized Chinese food. My first exposure to the idea of an Ethiopian restaurant was someone telling me an extremely worn out joke that isn't funny enough to repeat, and then a serious endorsement and a basic explanation of injera, the traditional spongy bread that is used in the place of utensils. Many years later, after moving to the Seattle area, I noticed Queen Sheba across the street while going to Vivace with a friend and decided to try it out.Despite having about five different dining companions here over many dinner visits, what inevitably seems to happen is sharing the vegetarian sampler of five different dishes including tasty lentils and greens as well as the yebeg wat, a lamb dish in a reddish-brown sauce that is spicy to my taste but still edible for my companions.Another less food-related reason I find myself coming back here is that Queen Sheba works well as part of an affordable dinner date before catching a show or other main event on Capitol Hill. It's not ideal for a first date as concern with first impressions doesn't mix well with the inevitable mess of eating with injera, but it's good for a relaxed second or third date (and at least I would personally be wary of someone who, under no pressure, is too uptight to forego utensils.)My only negatives about this place are:- It gets a bit hot inside during the summer.- At peak dinner times on weekends there can be a bit of a wait (I've waited about 20 minutes for a table for 2 on more than one occasion on a Saturday night.)- Parking is the standard Capitol Hill street parking.My only usual regret after dinner at Queen Sheba is that I'm so full of good food that there's no way I can go to Dilettante afterward in the same evening for dessert. Try it, you are unlikely to be disappointed. Love, love, love, love, LOVE this place! &#160;A friend recommended it to my bf and I, and we've been hooked ever since! &#160;Great atmosphere and VERY kind servers. &#160;Plus, the iced chai tea is a huge glass and delicious! &#160;Great ethiopian food (the spices are perfectly used in the dishes) and if you enjoy middle eastern food and aren't afraid to eat with your hands, then you should give it a try! &#160; *****! I loved Queen Sheba - had the veggie and meat combo, which was more than enough for me and 2 friends. Try their honey wine - it's sweet enough to stand on its own as a dessert. YUM! &#160;Service was great, and there was absolutely no wait when I went - this place is a gem. Had dinner last night and one of the best food I ever had.Tried their spicy chicken and Lamb tibs and just couldnt stop myself from foxing it. There is something very earthy about eating with your hands but a great experience nevertheless. Not very pricey. They have 3 Ethiopian beers as well as one non-alcoholic too. &#160;Not bad either.Might go again this week. OK, four stars, but I wanted to do four and a half. Where's the half stars, yelp? Anyway, good Ethiopian food. Great Ethiopian food. After having tried three others (four if you count Pan-African by Pike Place), I decided my review could be made, fairly and justly. The veggie platter is great, all the flavors are distinct, spiced well, and some are even kind of spicy, which I love. The other places I've been at, all residing down in the CD, haven't had the hotness that Sheba achieves. Each person gets their own basket of injera, so you are not reaching over your neighbor to get more. The platter is also perfectly sized. I come out beautifully full, with a nicely rounded belly. The honey wine was great, and though Sheba doesn't have the best wine prices (Mesob does) they are not the most expensive. Beyond that, the service is decent, not the best, but decent and warm, the crowd is mostly good, excepting certain groups that have a certain hostile, douchebag vibe, and the atmosphere was comfortable. Go here! Drink some wine, share some food, have fun again! Queen Sheba is a safe bet for Ethiopian food. The injera is cooked well, and is so so delicious. I always get the veggie combo platter, which comes with a variety of yummy vegan options....and they are all great, particularly their shiro wot. They are seasoned well, with a few that are spicier, for those who like the heat. The Ethiopian Honey Wine (Mild is better than sweet) compliments the meal well. It is not overly sweet and syrupy...but simply delicious! It is light, with a hint of sweetness, and tastes like honey, without overdoing it. It reminds me &#160;of what nectar from a flower might taste like....and of spring time. Of course this is a place you'll want to go with close friends/date since you'll be sharing a big platter (as with any Ethiopian establishment). There is this great sense of sharing and intimacy that is created when eating good Ethiopian food. Eating with your hands and w/out silverware is also a fun change and works out great. Prices were very reasonable. After all of this praise, I feel it necessary to comment on the service. Just feel that they could be a bit more friendly and often very slow. On busier nights, they are definitely under staffed. But that's really a side note. On the whole, it was a very good experience. Go there, eat and make merry...you won't be disappointed! My 2nd Ethiopian excursion.So between here and Kokeb, the differences lie in the Injera. &#160;They only serve the grey sourdough type here whereas Kokeb served both the sourdough and the wonderbread type. &#160;Also I felt that the spices here were more pronounced than at Kokeb.I've yet to taste the "fire" that I keep hearing about with Ethiopian food, but the chicken pieces?? &#160;I'm not even sure what it was in the red sauce was awesome. &#160;If it was spicier I would have only ordered that. &#160;The lamb or beef or whatever it was seemed a bit on the bland side. &#160;The dish with the chicken leg and the hard boiled egg felt bland as well.That said, I'm a fan of Ethiopian food and the fare here was just as good in it's own way as the other place I tried. &#160;I left oh so full and had the "breath" for the rest of the night. &#160;haha. &#160;You know what I'm talking about ...Parking kind of sucked and the people that kept opening the door and not shutting it kind of got on my nerves (cold and windy day) but overall I had a good meal and thought the food was great. Good food, good prices, friendly service. Recommend the vegetarian combo. Mmmmmm . . . Queen Sheba is very yummy.Order a bunch of dishes; they will all come out on a plate together and then you can all just attack them with your hands. &#160;It's messy. &#160;And you'd better be close friends! &#160;But the food is delicious and quite fairly priced.They've got a really tasty selection of juices like Guava, Mango, and Banana which are very refreshing and go great with the food.If there's a complaint about Queen Sheba, it's that there are VERY few employees. &#160;Service tends to be really slow, so I don't recommend this place if you are in a rush. &#160;It can also get really busy on Saturday nights; I recommend trying to go ata &#160;time when it's less busy; you'll get better service and a better seat! Finally, I don't get looked down on when I am stuffing my face without using utensils! &#160;This food was very good. &#160;It was fresh and we had plenty of it. &#160;Service was so/so considering we were one of only 2 groups eating there. &#160;I was often left staring at an empty water glass with my mouth on fiyah! &#160;They would have gotten 4 stars if we had a better waitress. &#160;It's true rating from me would probably be 3.5 stars. I really enjoy this restaurant. &#160;Your food is served on one platter for the table so you can try each other's food if you wish. &#160;I have never had a dish I didn't like, nor have I ever left hungry. &#160;You can order dinner &amp; a beer for less than $20. &#160;My only complaint is that it's often packed after work and the service is a little slow but the food makes it worth it. If you've got a big appetite and want tasty tasty food to fill you up, check out Queen Sheba.Get the Veggie Roll appetizer. &#160;It is the veggie plate rolled into injira, &#160;and cut into bite size pieces. &#160; If you have a big crowd, get more than one plate, because they go fast. &#160;I'm amazed how much I like these even with their lack of meaty substance.The samplers are good, and have a variety of food to pick from. &#160;I don't know the difference between a wot and a tib, but everything in the sampler is tasty stuff, even the boiled egg covered in brown sauce. &#160; If you go during the day, make sure you have enough time for a nap after you go. It is good to have an African restaurant right off Broadway but this is far from the best East African food you can find in Seattle. &#160;Too bland for my taste. &#160;Nice atmosphere, but if you want great full flavored food, look elsewhere. If you are into checking new tastes from the world this place wont let you down. Its good. Its exciting and its cool. Try the Ethiopian beer or wine. The vege combo platter is so good. Go try it .Go! Okay, so this is the only Ethiopian place I've eaten at ever. So take that as you may.I love the food here. Everything is good, especially if it has tibs in the name. Get a house tea while you're at it.The food gets 4 stars, but the service is slooooooow. Friendly, but slooooow.
So while at my "job transition workshop" awhile ago I found myself in a somewhat unfamiliar area and unsure where to go for lunch. My classmate wanted teriyaki, so off to Midori we went. The shop is a little dingy, but I wasn't really expecting anything better. The prices seemed a tad high considering you can get a fancy sandwich or entree anywhere else for about the same. Anyways, I ordered beef with broccoli. I think she ordered chicken teriyaki and a salad. My meal was OK. Not great, but I ate most of it so I can't say I hated it. That being said, I can't imagine what circumstances would bring me here again. As an aside, I swear the sign outside says "Midori Teriyaki #4." Are there three other ones? If so they haven't been Yelped...
Everything on the menu is $6.95, even combos! Not only that, but Harried &amp; Hungry is ridiculously fast and there is plenty of seating. It's generally not crowded, unlike most of the other places in the area. My only complaint is that the combos seem a bit limited. I wish it was ANY half sandwich with a cup of soup or salad, but for the half sandwich combos, you're stuck with a choice of mozzarella caprese, turkey swiss or chicken pesto. In the midst of enjoying my first H&amp;H lunch combo, and feel the need to write a review. Basically, check this place out. For $6.95, you can get a combo for lunch (which is incredibly filling by the way). I didn't eat breakfast today, and can barely make it through my "small" salad and half-sandwich.The house salad is really bomb, w/ beets, mixed greens, goat cheese, and walnuts. There was just enough dressing, in my opinion. The chicken pesto sandwich on the other hand, is good, but kind of dry. Word on the street is that the turkey club is better...Also, if you order online you can skip the crowd to pick it up (although it wasn't very crowded at 11:55 a.m. when I walked in), and they give you points every time you order that save you money on your lunch. I'll definitely be back! Really solid lunch place. *Really* solid lunch place. Based on strength of reviews, I had to give this a try. Plus, it's west of my office, an area I feel I'm ignoring during my stay in Seattle. The menu says items are pushing $8. and that would still be a deal, given the food. But a sticker on the menu stand says "Ignore these prices! $6.95!" Which makes this a stellar deal. Even after I bought a fancy drink it wasn't $10. My lunch was a chicken pesto sandwich, which had nice pesto (although could have used more) but importantly had warm chicken, good tomatoes and spring greens, and was on a warm roll. Just having it be warm (and not the whole sandwich, so if they microwave, they at least strategically microwave) makes a huge difference. Very good. But the real winner was the Harried House salad. Spring greens, sliced beets, sliced pears, candied walnuts, and goat cheese, with a good light vinaigrette. A better salad than I would ever expect in a $6.95 combo, on quality of ingredients alone. The beets were good - and I don't even like beets. The pears were the perfect texture, both sweet and with actual pear flavor. the goat cheese mild and creamy, and the candied walnuts...well, they were really more like toffee, they were so candied. But I'm not complaining - this whole salad was awesome. Only two complaints: the salad was in what was kind of like a deep cereal bowl. Hard to eat. But this is hardly a complaint worth mentioning. More substantive - your sandwich choices are limited in the combos. Will I be able to try a different sandwich knowing I can't get the salad too? They don't have half salads, so I just might be stuck in a rut after the first visit. I love this place; it's an under-appreciated find!Sandwiches, soups, and salads, all modestly priced and ready for either sit-down or take away. &#160;I'm a fan of the combo lunch, which gets you 2 out of 3 choices (soup, sandwich, or salad) for about $7. &#160;The food is really good, the service is fast, and the staff is friendly. &#160;And it's rarely busy! &#160;One of my favorite spots to sit down for a meal or just pop in to grab lunch on my way back to my horrifying office job. It's 7:43 a.m., and I have to leave for the bus stop at 7:46 a.m.I forgot to make my lunch. &#160;Crap.This is where Harried &amp; Hungry comes in. &#160;I work downtown, so the lunch prices are ridiculous (ten bucks for a salad? Please.) and blah-blah-economy-blah-blah. &#160;Honestly, I just think it's silly to pay a ton of money for something as simple as bread, meat, cheese and a couple of veggies.Every single lunch entree at Harried &amp; Hungry: $6.95. &#160;Ordering online? &#160;Get 30 cents off and, oftentimes, coupons in your email to take off another 10%.The sandwiches and salads are good, too: I've had the Harried House salad (which made me realize I like beets) and the Turkey and Swiss sandwich. &#160;Both were filling, delicious and made with quality ingredients. &#160;I'm not a fan of pickles, but if you are, you'll be pleased to note that each sandwich is cut in half and topped with two baby dills. &#160;(Aww.)When I don't bring lunch from home, this is easily the healthiest, cheapest alternative. &#160;(My non-healthy alternative: MOD Super Fast Pizza.) We happened to be walking down the street, looking for some food, when we saw Harried &amp; Hungry - "That describes us exactly," I exclaimed to my friends, and we decided to give it a try. And it was so good. I had an enormous complicated salad, with bacon and hard-boiled eggs and chicken, plus a peach smoothie that tasted like peaches. Seattle is a little far away from Portland, but if I have the opportunity I'm pretty sure I'll stop by again. Stopped in for a quick lunch. Fast, courteous service. They gave us free cookies that were quite big and fresh! I got an egg salad sandwich and a house salad, both of which were good. The egg salad sandwich had lettuce and tomato on it, which was kinda odd but tasty enough; the salad was better. Reasonably priced, vegetarian friendly. Would go there again! Harried &amp; Hungry is a solid four stars. &#160;I have been here many times. &#160;My very first sandwich downtown was from H&amp;H when our office moved down here. &#160;Better than average sandwiches, great soup, (I love their rendition of beef/barley) and great salads. &#160;Eat here or take it with you. &#160;They use those goofy flashy/blinky beeper things to tell you when your order is ready - which don't add to the experience, but are handy.
Let's just say, Spiro's is working on more stars....sort of like cub scouts and badges.I've enjoyed:The stuffed calzone with pepperoni and sausage.Spaghetti with marinara and green salad. (vinaigrette dressing)Tortellini with white sauce and green salad. (ranch dressing)I've had a better calzone from Pizza Hut. &#160;The bread was bland and thick. &#160;The sauce was slightly spicy but I like the stuffing to be the main part of the calzone, not the breaded pocket. &#160;I will not order that again.The Spaghetti with marinara was good, more or less mediocre. &#160;I liked the salad but found it to be standard. &#160;Good crunchy chunks of lettuce and olives sprinkled heavily atop made me smile.White sauce Tortellini is the only thing that stands out in my mind. &#160;It did taste a bit salty but it was creamy and good. &#160;Definitely not good for me but good for the taste buds.The dressings on each salad were nothing special, probably bought wholesale at Costco or something.Like everyone else, I felt more like it was Greek than Italian. &#160;Eh. &#160;Good waiter, male, cute, damn witty and crazy brows! &#160;He sort of made it a better experience. &#160;The atmosphere is clean and neat. &#160;Definitely a kid friendly and family oriented environment.I'll give their pizza a try but the menu is pretty limited. &#160;I'm also going to try the Lasagna, Ravioli, and a few of their sandwiches....although I'm prepared to be disappointed by the bread on those subs! Wonderful Greek style pizza - golden brown crust, with a nice crust of cheese on top. In my top 10 pizza places for sure!The atmosphere leaves a little to be desired for me - I prefer something a little grittier, or even trendier - the inside of Spiro's is kinda boring, which does take a little something from my pizza experience. Still, it's damn good pizza!
Hands down, the best dim sum in Seattle. We've done the rounds, Sun Ya (delicious, but has slipped in the last few years), Jade Garden (fuck your lines!), and have decided that Harbor City is our new favorite.We ended up here on Sunday after a failed visit to House of Hong (blech) and were treated to hot, fresh, flavorful dim sum classics. Clearly they're doing something right, as we were one of only three tables of white folk (my litmus test of authenticity). Harbor City, FTW! My friends and I were really excited to try some dimsum in Seattle.Thanks to the great reviews on yelp we found Harbor City! They're open from 8:30 - 10 PM from Mondays to Thursday and on Fridays to Sundays they're open till midnight! Can't really beat a place that opens late to get your fix!We went here on a Monday and parking around the area was not a problem and the restaurant wasn't that busy! Service was fast, and they were really friendly and patient considering it was our first time there! We ordered a few items on their menu, but when it didn't come out, we reminded our server to cancel it and she did it with no questions ask! The food was a hit! We were very satisfied with most of the food and it was pretty cheap! - 1 because one of orders we really wanted never made it on our table.- 1 because they didn't have a couple of items we asked for. Still a solid 3 STARS!!! I've only had "proper" (read: a cart comes around and you pick foods off of it!) dim sum once, when I was young, but the memory stuck with me and ever since then I've thought about dim sum at least once a week. There's just something about a traveling buffet, a wandering visual, tactile menu, that appeals to me.So when I was wandering around the ID with my friends and we got hungry, it seemed like a great time and place to try to find some dim sum. Harbor City was well-reviewed on Yelp, so we went there.The place was nearly empty on an early weekend evening, but the few tables that were full, were full of Chinese families, which I took to be a good sign. I've barely ever had "real" (versus "American") Chinese food, but I've an adventurous and open-minded palate, and I'd rather try something strange and authentic than always stick with what I know.(I'm also mostly vegetarian - and unfortunately Chinese food isn't super veg-friendly - but I do make exceptions when I want to try new things.)Harbor City didn't have dim sum as I remembered it. There were no carts, no steamy buns full of red bean curd and pork. There was a menu with (unappealing) pictures; we ordered off that.The food was mostly good. Nothing astounding, but I enjoyed the dumplings in their tiny, steamy baskets, and the pea vines were delicious. The service was prompt and respectful, if not very warm. I'm not sure that I'd go back - it didn't blow my socks off, but neither did it disappoint. Except that there were no carts. No carts! My search for carts continues. Honest opinion, not as good as Jade Garden. Simply because the food here is moderately just "OK". If you're here to just stick with the generic dim sum items, go for it. If your here to try something new, variety is not your friend. Great alternative if you want to beat Jade Garden's wait time.Dishes ordered: Dim sum Ok, I have been here over 5 times now and I can say without hesitation that this is not good dim sum. There is a delicate nature to good dim sum that this place lacks. For example, the shrimp dumpling filling is overly fishy yet lacking in flavor, the wrapper is an unusual texture and they are thrown into the steamer in such a way that when they get to your table the wrapper is already halfway free of the filling and they have all stuck together. Same for all their seafood dumplings. The chicken feet are just ok and the pea vines are overly greasy. Overall I don't understand why people wait for this place and I will not be doing so anymore. The places on the Eastside are not great, but they are better than this place. If you have to eat dim sum like I do, regardless of wether it's the best you have ever had, then it's worth the extra toll and gas to go to Joi's on the Eastside. It's not SF standard, but it's better than this place. Yeah I am a fan. I think this place is better than any we have down in Portland (correct me if I'm wrong because I am not very familiar with the SE district). And cheap. &#160;Foodwise, I loved the sticky rice, green beans, and everything else. The fried taro, in my view, had too fine crust.BTW, watch out for a barking guy at the free for-customers-only parking lot at the corner across the street from Harbor City. &#160;We parked there to look up a restaurant and the guy literally barked at us (the kid and me) when we walked away from the car. &#160;I don't know what he was saying (I don't speak Chinese) but it took me for a while that I could communicate to him that another person was in the car and was about to move the car out. We got there at 11am on a Saturday, we only had a 10 min wait. The dim sum is excellent, the dim sum is bigger than at other places and the prices are so great. I like the fact that they have smaller portion plates of non dim sum items like the Salt &amp; Pepper Calmari and the Honey Walnut Prawns (both of which were excellent). The place was packed and there were about 20 people waiting by the time we left at noon. Probably the best dim sum in the Puget Sound area.
This is such an odd place in a little residential area. &#160;The bubble tea is good, though far from the best I've ever had, very sweet and highly flavored. &#160;The crepes are good too, with generous portions and the prices are good too. &#160;The interior is very comfy with a cute and warm feel, I would definitely come back. Great service! Mango chicken crepe was big, filling and fantastic. The croissant breakfast sandwich was smaller but still very tasty. Can't wait to come back for the nutty banana crepe. If you're nearby, this is definitely worth stopping in. Weird but comfy environment. &#160;Best Taro bubble tea i have had. &#160;Employees were quick and polite. &#160;Only downside is that it is semi difficult to get to. Coffee is decent. &#160;Service was good. &#160;Not sure what all the hype is about this place. &#160;Could it be the bubble tea? &#160;I will try that next and then update. Not only the best boba, but also outstanding service. &#160;The employees stayed half an hour after closing time on New Year's Eve so that I could pick up my wallet which I'd left there.Also, try their crepes- they're great!Thanks to Pearls I've only been here twice, but always MEAN to go by more often. Maybe 2012 will be the year for it. :-)The bubble tea is great, as are the banh mi sandwiches, soups, and other snacks. The owners are sweet as pie and SO helpful, as well, they seem to really want to take good care of their customers (a rarity these days IMO). If you're in the Delridge neighborhood and want a nice place to stop for coffee/tea and a warm snack, highly recommend! There's a cutie behind the bar with dimples, dorky glasses and a baggy sweatshirt. I came in and surprised her with a rose....she smiled..and I wanted to pinch her cheeks. I ordered the mango chicken crepe....portion is not bad at all it was just right. Presentation and taste were great....the epitome of Vietnamese fusion with french influences such as the pickled dicons.....the cafe is welcoming and beautifully decorated with just enough colorful lighting for the correct ambiance. A bit out of the way for me but it was worth the time and trip ;) I don't know about this place...nothing special to me. &#160;Costco muffins and cookies, bags of doritos and gummy bears...am I missing something? &#160;I didn't try the crepes but I hope they're homemade. &#160;My vanilla latte had no vanilla, not that I could taste anyway and the coffee wasn't very strong. &#160;The people behind the counter were very nice though so that's a plus. &#160;I don't know...nothing to write home about, I've definitely had better. I've been looking for tea/coffee shops like this since I've moved here from Boston. I love the atmosphere and they have very good selection of coffee/food (for a coffee shop). I'm not sure if it's owned by a couple but they were the sweetest people. The food prices are also very reasonable. I ordered a bbq baguette for around $5 and it was pretty big. There is free wii there and tables with plugs so for anyone who wants to drink/eat good coffee/food while working, that is the place to go. Wow. I don't know how anyone could go to Starbucks with a place like this around! Everything we ordered was just fantastic. My green apple bubble tea was delicious, as was my husband's white chocolate mocha, which was the best one either of us has ever had. We split the meatloaf baguette, which as my husband's choice and the smoked salmon crepe, which was mine. I would not have chosen the meatloaf but boy, was I glad he did. It was soooo good, with lean, melt-in-your-mouth meat. The smoked salmon crepe was equally amazing. We both loved the extra kick given by the daikons. We took our meal to go but the space is adorable and very welcoming, and so is the staff! Loved it!! I don't have any complaints, but didn't wow me enough to give 5 stars. &#160;I never ate food here, and the bubble tea is good.When we lived in West Seattle, this was our go-to bubble tea place, because the other places in the area are thumbs down. &#160;I quite like the decorating in here, maybe wouldn't quite jive with interior decorator tips, but TONS of personality! &#160;Which is what I love! &#160;I always fantasized about plunking down and studying there for a while, but we always just made a b-line there and zoomed away again. Cool eclectic interior like a really coze college lounge. &#160;At first I am thinking they only serve coffees and bubble drinks, but they have food, too! &#160;Excellent Food! &#160;I had a Hot Mama crepe with spicy links. &#160;Delish! &#160;The pearl drinks were great, too. &#160;Lots of flavor options. I love this place. Best coffee and bubble tea in west seattle! They cook the tapioca just perfect. The people that work there are so lovely and nice. The restaurant has a &#160;great vibe too and the set up is absolutely fantastic! They have wi-fi so you can grab a cup of coffee and maybe even try their delectable crepes or baguette sandwiches and eat while working on your laptop. This place is fantastic. The ambiance is delightfully rustic (ie: old and eclectic, yet comfortable.) The service is great, always with a smile. Best of all it's one of the few local businesses in the part of the Delridge corridor.The bubble tea here is great. The tapioca pearls are always fresh and tasty. Somehow the bubble tea I get here tastes better than even bubble tea from the international district.If you're hoping for food, the selection is limited but doable. Crepes are the best choice and seem a bit expensive, but occasionally they hit the spot! I love Pearls!I work about 3 blocks away, and it's always my go to when I'm hungry for lunch. They have so many options for such a small shop and their bubble tea doesn't make me sick to my stomach like Oasis does. Outside, Pearls looks really small, and it is really small. But when you go inside, the place is so cleverly decorated, every inch of space carefully utilize to maximize its use! Comfy couches, cute little tables, they even have space for a mini fountain in the middle of the place. For sure, give this place a visit. Their crepes are soooo good!Plus they walk out to bring you your order while you're sitting. How sweet! Love this place. So, barely tried a TASTE of bubble tea the other day somewhere else and was instantly hooked. I had driven by this Pearls a million times in the past few months and knew they had tea, so thought I'd grab one on the way home. So glad I did! It's a cute little place, with some parking on the street and 4 spaces on the left side of the building. I ordered a blended Taro with tapioca, a huge cup and only $4! It was sooooo good! Such an earthy, sweet taste...I am really hooked now. I saw they have crepes and other food items and I'm sure they are good too. I'll try them sometime in the near future :) Good job, Pearls! It deserves to be busy and packed, but I'm kind of glad that it's not. Great service, super casual, decent prices. The cookies are so-so (kind of doughy), but the coffee is top-notch and the bubble tea is great. The layout is really cool, so you can watch TV (they usually have sports playing), or just hang out in your own little corner. It's all very well-loved furniture, so you're not worried about dribbling on yourself or anything like that, and it's super-comfortable. Feels like when you'd hang out at your poor friend's house with the really nice mom who happens to be an awesome cook.
I really enjoyed my recent small group dinner with some fellow yelpers here last week.The nachos certainly lived up to the good things I'd heard about them, as did the margaritas. The hold back, mainly, for me, was the lighting. I get it; ambiance, mood setting, all that. Really, I do. But I am "night blind". I really cannot see well in the dark. And certain light levels over others are the *worst*. When I walked in looking for the group (who I knew was there, the host had *just* stolen my parking spot not 5 minutes earlier) I couldn't see a bloody thing farther than a few feet in front of me. Navigating that in a full bar while intoxicated would be the death of me, and anyone in my falling radius.Overall, though, it was a good evening getting to know some new (to me) yelpers and seeing some veteran favorites again. I'd do an event on the "upper deck" level of the place, and I'll try and trek it out to WS again to sample a bit more of the menu. As often happens on my West Seattle excursions, the scene is as follows: there is a beer festival of some sort or other at Beveridge; I have partaken; hunger and a need for sustenance ensues.This time, I wanted to check out Mission, which has been on or slightly under my radar for years. We arrived about halfway through the daily happy hour, and despite having sampled two trays of barleywine between the three of us, we hadn't imbibed to a margarita-preventing level...so promptly ordered a couple. Plus two plates of three tacos (shredded chicken), a couple of orders of chips, pico and guacamole, and some sweet pappas (roasted sweet potatoes with a bit of crema, some crumbled cotija and green onion atop) to share.The dishes were your standard American-Mexican fare, meaning that if you're a haunter of taco trucks whenever possible, these won't be your thing. So they weren't mine, but they were fine (especially for the price!). The shredded chicken was mild, the guacamole a bit dry, and the sweet potatoes a world away from the sort of patatas bravas that stir my Latin-loving heart. Nevertheless, the platters arrived promptly and with a smile, and the margaritas were impressive: heavy hint of decent tequila, without the cloying, artificial sweetness so prevalent in bars 'round the world. It's the rare spot that makes me want to return to taste tequila, but Mission might be one given their expertise with a lowly happy hour drink.I can't say anything about the rest of the menu since I only tasted the aforementioned happy hour offerings, and I know that many bars and restaurants excel elsewhere. But for what I refer to as Mexpensive, I might be more inclined to head to Barrio (for inventive/Americanized) or El Mestizo (for vibrant/traditional) in my neighborhood if I'm craving some Latin flavor. Nevertheless, I look forward to a return to Mission: the interior is pretty sexy with the low-lit booths, prayer candles (they work, I swear!), hanging paper lights and the lovely brick-backed bar. And then there's that little matter of the many pages of tequilas.... The Mission is basically a clone of a clone; not to get all Old Testament on you, but Peso's begat (complete with nasty law suit) Matador and Matador begat Mission. &#160;It's the new style of Mexican restaurant now days and a step away from the cheesier (pun intended) incarnations of Tex-Mex like Azteca, Toreros and Las Margaritas. &#160;The newer places are better decorated, don't have the combo plates and don't dump copious amounts of shredded iceberg lettuce and cheddar cheese over everything. &#160;a major improvement to be sure, but already these new places are beginning to feel pretty formula, too.I have no real complaints about Mission. &#160;I really dig the space and appreciate that it's more bar than restaurant. &#160;The food was pretty decent, but I have to tell you, the beef tacos across the street at Admiral Pub are better than anything I had on the menu at Mission and that's not meant to be a slight on Mission, it's just that somehow Admiral Pub is pretty out some pretty awesome tacos. &#160;The bartender was great and overall this is a decent place. I like the mission. &#160;Love the plantain chips, although the portion is a bit small for the price. &#160; I think the food is flavorful and interesting, especially the pork dishes.The margaritas are great - very well mixed and tasty - not too sweet or bitter.I don't really enjoy how dark the place is. &#160;Makes me feel like I'm spending &#160;more than usual for dinner in a basement. If I'm having my birthday there tonight, April 28, at 8pm, that means it's a pretty cool spot. (pssst, this also means you're invited)It's a lounge-y-type of place, so if you're looking for crazy dancing and loud music, Mission isn't typically the place for you. NOW, there are definitely exceptions, Cinco de Mayo, which is coming up in a few days. It was ballistic last year. A band in the corner, people crammed in there. It was amazing. Awesome food, cool people that can actually converse without saying "WHAT???!!" all the time, and great drinks all around. Oh, by the way, the atmosphere and decor is unlike any other bar in the city. You can tell owner Peter really scored with the details. While I enjoyed the Lizzard Lounge from back in the day, Mission came in and made everyone forget it ever existed. Met up for sister's birthday celebration. Ambiance was great, food was very good and creative. There also appeared to be a private party going on upstairs which seemed perfect for an after work event.Music was modern, didn't really match the motif. We were also looking for a fruity drink of some sort and they really didn't have anything like that. Overall pretty good. :) Best margaritas ever. &#160;Order the Bartender's &amp; you'll be happy!! &#160;Order 2 and you'll be in love. &#160;;) I like the mission and the fact that it has many veggie options. &#160; I went there this evening with family and friends and had a fine meal. &#160; Here is a rundown Happy Hour(4 star)Twice daily, 4 to 6 and 10-midnight. &#160; Nice priced appetizers, drinks were a $1 off for drinks on the &#160;Happy Hour menu. &#160; Be careful if you are there close to 6 and order as if they get your order in past 6 you pay full price. &#160;Nachos were really tasty as well as the house margaritas.Yum!Dinner(3 star): &#160; I had the portabella enchilada's which were good, but heavy taste of cinnamon. &#160; Portion was ok, but priced a bit high for my liking. Atmosphere(4 star): &#160; Swanky, dark, nice candle light, rustic wood mirrors-I like the feel of the restaurant !Wait Staff (4 star) &#160; Very good customer service and she checked back with us often.Price (2 star)----Veggie options should have been priced closer to $10 instead of $13.00 Next Visit---I think I will take advantage of happy hour and eat dinner at home for the price Mission is great for happy hour! &#160;The three soft tacos are my favorite hh menu item, and they are fine with mixing and matching (unlike some other Mexican restaurants in Seattle that forbid this). &#160;The mix and match is great because the sweet pappas taco is AMAZING...but as a meat eater, I wouldn't want three of them. &#160;The beer selection isn't anything to get excited about, but the tequila selection is fabulous.I have only sat at the bar, and the server has always been fast and attentive. &#160;I would say, lacking in personality and friendliness - but certainly not at a detriment to our experience. &#160;We missed happy hour by a few minutes and realized that Mission is strict on their happy hour times. &#160;It was shocking how much more expensive the same 3 tacos from the happy hour menu were on the regular menu. &#160;We skipped the pricey food and ended up sharing the chicken nachos - which were pretty tasty...but I like my nachos with the cheese at least slightly melted - the platter we had was just sprinkled on cold. &#160;The ample chicken and black beans made up for the difference in me and Mission's nacho cheese temperature preferences.I disagree with reviews comparing Mission to Matador, though I can see why they made the comparison. &#160; I feel like Mission has a much less commercial feel than the Matador and lacks the snooty vibe I get in there sometimes. &#160;I will be back for happy hour again and again! I have never eaten anything but HH food here. &#160;I'm sure they have a full menu, but I don't think I've ever even looked at it. &#160;That being said, if you're looking for a place to grab HH, definitely try this place out. &#160;The nachos are always great and plentiful. &#160;The servers are always super attentive and don't seem to mind groups, even those where people meander in and out at different times. This is the second time I went to Mission, but this time I actually got food. The food was tasty and the portion sizes were what Americans SHOULD be eating, so for most that would be a bit on the small side. I was there for my sister-in-law's private birthday shindig and we got our own bartender, but service was quick and pleasant. Dish prices were about $10-15 for a normal dish and about $7-10 for appetizers. Drinks were pretty standard as well, but a bit on the strong side. Overall a great experience and it's always great to have places like this in West Seattle. I can walk to this bar in west Seattle but it's worth a drive as well. Fantastic food. Very dark with bar and table seating. Two levels. A turntable. Friendly bar staff. Perfect for finishing off an evening... And probably starting one as well! Great drinks, excellent food, and music as well Very nice atmosphere and music seems to vary in volume (from ok to too loud.)Drinks a bit expensive.Food good.Nothing special but then again that means (in Seattle) pretty good as the competition is so ferocious and so many places so good. My 30th birthday had crept up on me &amp; needed a stellar place to have a party. Mission rents out the mezzanine for a great price. I met with Peter (awesome to work with!) and we planned out my special evening. It was an 80's themed party and all the guest were dressed to kill! The Bartender was incredible and the food, like always, was outstanding. I have loved every visit to Mission, but loved this one the most! They made it a great 30th birthday bash! Thank you for a great time guys! You are wonderful &amp; I can't wait to come back soon and have some delicious Mexican food! Happy hour at Mission is one of the best in West Seattle. &#160;For $5 you get three soft tacos which usually fill me up. &#160;The ambiance is really nice too, and you don't have to be 21 to eat there. &#160;The bartenders margarita is a must and the waitresses are always very pleasant. Sweet Potato Enchilada!....The waitress got annoyed after she had to move us to another table "no fault of ours" she was snappy and short the rest of the night which sort of ruined it but I had no expectations, so, hey. Great place for a first date! Food is good and happy hour specials are yummy! Mission is one of my favorite late-night happy hour haunts.Reviews of Mexican-style restaurants always seem to devolve into whether the cuisine is 'authentic' or not. I will say upfront that I generally could care less and only judge based on taste and experience. Weigh accordingly...They are probably too expensive during dinner hours -- expect to spend at least 20 bucks a person on dinner here once a drink is included. The food is tasty and usually spot on in terms of serving size.They have a very good beer selection (not just mexican imports but NW rotating) and also a good (but slightly pricy) tequila selection. They have &#160;most of my favorite tequilas...The atmosphere is great -- low lighting, candles, and quirkiness. Anyone who's been to the Matador will be very at home in this more down to earth rendition of that theme...Happy hour this place comes into its own with good food and drinks and a kitchen open late. Highly recommend! Really liked this place, service was good and so was the drink. &#160;Chips and salsa were tasty as well! &#160;Didn't have any food off the menu but my friend enjoyed their calamari. &#160;I look forward to returning! This was my second experience at Mission. &#160;My husband and I tried the restaurant over a year ago and it wasn't memorable, for better or worse. &#160;I suggested we try it again tonight, and I think it will be our last time there. &#160;We mostly had a poor experience with service. &#160;Our server seemed very uninterested in our needs and we actually got more help from the host, who may have also been the manager than we did from the bored server. &#160;For the first time ever, my husband and I agreed that we needed to leave a small tip. &#160;We are good tippers by practice, and tip 20% as a rule, sometimes better for great service. &#160;Its a shame that we didn't feel &#160;that great about being there, because some of the food had potential. &#160;My fish tacos were really pretty good, and we had some interesting peach and cheese stuffed jalapenos to start. &#160; The hubby rated his dinner as a 6 out of 10, and my friend was disappointed in hers. &#160;They charge $3 for chips and salsa, which was a waste. &#160;They were cold and tasted stale. &#160;Mission: fail. Nice place, nice atmosphere, pretty tasty margaritas. &#160;Still can't get over being charged for chips and salsa, then when we wanted a bit more salsa with our meal we were charged another $1.50. &#160;Just seems crazy to me and resulted in me taking away a star. My husband and I came here on the recommendation from friends. I liked the ambiance right away. I ordered the Flirtini drink which was strong but lovely. I also enjoyed my sweet potato enchilada. Husband liked his food but didnt' love it. Our dessert was only okay, but presented in a fun way. &#160;We'll definitely come back another time. I love the Matador, but this place tries (not successfully IMO) to be it's exact twin. I've tried the food here three times now, and ive found it to be pretty bland and unimpressive. The drinks are fine, and I love the decor. I just think the food is pretty meh, since I ordered something with habanero sauce and could barely taste it. Maybe my taste buds got burned off along the way? Great happy hour - good selection of drinks and food. Service was a little slow, otherwise an excellent happy hour for tonight! Food's very tasty, though not authentic. Upscale. For people who like some spice just ask for my fave "el Yucateco" and add heat to taste. Like it here . Nice tequila flight.
